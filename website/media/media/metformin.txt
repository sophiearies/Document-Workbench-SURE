Abstract
  Metformin is the first choice drug for the treatment of type 2 diabetes due to positive results in reducing hyperglycaemia and insulin resistance. However, diabetic patients have higher risk of ventricular arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death, and metformin failed to reduce ventricular arrhythmia in clinical trials. In order to explore the mechanisms responsible for the lack of protective effect, we investigated in vivo the effect of metformin on cardiac electrical activity in non-diabetic rats; and in vitro in isolated ventricular myocytes, HEK293 cells expressing the hERG channel and human induced pluripotent stem cells derived cardiomyocytes (hIPS-CMs). Surface electrocardiograms showed that long-term metformin treatment (7 weeks) at therapeutic doses prolonged cardiac repolarization, reflected as QT and QTc interval duration, and increased ventricular arrhythmia during the caffeine/dobutamine challenge. Patch-clamp recordings in ventricular myocytes isolated from treated animals showed that the cellular mechanism is a reduction in the cardiac transient outward potassium current (Ito). In vitro, incubation with metformin for 24 h also reduced Ito, prolonged action potential duration, and increased spontaneous contractions in ventricular myocytes isolated from control rats. Metformin incubation also reduced IhERG in HEK293 cells. Finally, metformin incubation prolonged action potential duration at 30% and 90% of repolarization in hIPS-CMs, which is compatible with the reduction of Ito and IhERG. Our results show that metformin directly modifies the electrical behavior of the normal heart. The mechanism consists in the inhibition of repolarizing currents and the subsequent decrease in repolarization capacity, which prolongs AP and QTc duration.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: The preclinical and clinical data regarding the efficacy of metformin as a pro-cognitive and anti-depressant therapy is mixed. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials investigating the effects of metformin on cognition and depressive symptoms.

   METHODS: The study was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines (PROSPERO identifier: CRD42020184547). PubMed and Web of Science were searched (inception through to May 6, 2020) for trials which measured the effects (change from baseline to end-of-treatment) of metformin on cognition and depressive symptoms, compared to either placebo or other oral antidiabetic therapies. When feasible, pooled meta-analytic estimates were provided using a random-effects model.

   RESULTS: Eight studies met the inclusion criteria: four assessed only cognition, three assessed only depressive symptoms, and one study assessed both cognition and depressive symptoms. Results suggested that metformin was significantly superior to placebo in improving cognitive function in patients suffering with clinical conditions associated with cognitive impairment (SMD: 0.80; 95%CI: 0.46 to 1.15; p < 0.001; N = 2 studies; I2 = 0.0%). One study reported an association between improved cognition and depressive symptoms in a cohort of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and depression. Two studies investigating metformin versus pioglitazone showed a superior, but not significant, effect of pioglitazone on depressive symptoms (SMD: 1.56; 95%CI: -0.52 to 3.56; p = 0.13;I2 = 94.9%; N = 2 studies).

   LIMITATIONS: Assessment of risk of bias identified two studies as having "some concerns".

   CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that metformin might be re-purposed for the treatment of cognitive deficits in select clinical conditions. Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Lifestyle intervention and metformin have been shown to prevent diabetes; however, their efficacy in preventing cardiovascular disease associated with the development of diabetes is unclear. We examined whether these interventions reduced the incidence of major cardiovascular events over a 21-year median follow-up of participants in the DPP trial (Diabetes Prevention Program) and DPPOS (Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study).

   METHODS: During DPP, 3234 participants with impaired glucose tolerance were randomly assigned to metformin 850 mg twice daily, intensive lifestyle or placebo, and followed for 3 years. During the next 18-year average follow-up in DPPOS, all participants were offered a less intensive group lifestyle intervention, and unmasked metformin was continued in the metformin group. The primary outcome was the first occurrence of nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death adjudicated by standard criteria. An extended cardiovascular outcome included the primary outcome or hospitalization for heart failure or unstable angina, coronary or peripheral revascularization, coronary heart disease diagnosed by angiography, or silent myocardial infarction by ECG. ECGs and cardiovascular risk factors were measured annually.

   RESULTS: Neither metformin nor lifestyle intervention reduced the primary outcome: metformin versus placebo hazard ratio 1.03 (95% CI, 0.78-1.37; P = 0.81) and lifestyle versus placebo hazard ratio 1.14 (95% CI, 0.87-1.50; P = 0.34). Risk factor adjustment did not change these results. No effect of either intervention was seen on the extended cardiovascular outcome.

   CONCLUSIONS: Neither metformin nor lifestyle reduced major cardiovascular events in DPPOS over 21 years despite long-term prevention of diabetes. Provision of group lifestyle intervention to all, extensive out-of-study use of statin and antihypertensive agents, and reduction in the use of study metformin together with out-of-study metformin use over time may have diluted the effects of the interventions.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) an association between severe hypoglycaemic episodes and the risk of cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality has been previously established.

   METHODS: We aimed to investigate the influence of hypoglycaemia on several diabetes-related and platelet-related miRNAs selected based on bioinformatic analysis and literature search, including hsa-miR-16, hsa-miR-34a, hsa-miR-129-2, hsa-miR-15a, hsa-miR-15b, hsa-miR-106a, miR-223, miR-126. Selected miRNAs were validated by qRT-PCR in 14 patients with T2DM on metformin monotherapy, without established CV disease and antiplatelet therapy during a stepwise hypoglycaemic clamp experiment and a follow-up 7 days after the clamp event. In order to identify which pathways and phenotypes are associated with validated miRNAs we performed target prediction on genes expressed with high confidence in platelets.

   RESULTS: Circulating levels of miR-106a-5p, miR-15b, miR-15a, miR-16-5p, miR-223 and miR-126 were increased after euglycaemic clamp followed by hypoglycaemic clamp, each with its distinctive time trend. On the contrary, miR-129-2-3p, miR-92a-3p and miR-34a-3p remained unchanged. MiR-16-5p was negatively correlated with interleukin (IL)-6, intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM) and vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM) (p = 0.002, p < 0.001, p = 0.016, respectively), whereas miR-126 was positively correlated with VCAM (p < 0.001). There were negative correlations between miR-16-5p, miR-126 and coagulation factors, including factor VIII and von Willebrand factor (vWF). Among all studied miRNAs, miR-126, miR-129-2-3p and miR-15b showed correlation with platelet function. Bioinformatic analysis of platelet-related targets of analyzed miRNAs showed strong enrichment of IL-2 signaling. We also observed significant enrichment of pathways and diseases related to cancer, CV diseases, hyperglycemia, and neurological diseases.

   CONCLUSIONS: Hypoglycaemia can significantly influence the expression of platelet-enriched miRNAs, with a time trend paralleling the time course of platelet activation. This suggests miRNAs could be exploited as biomarkers for platelet activation in response to hypoglycaemia, as they are probably released by platelets upon activation by hypoglycaemic episodes. Should they hold their promise in clinical endpoint studies, platelet-derived miRNAs might become helpful markers of CV risk in subjects with diabetes.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common joint disease, and is most frequently seen in the knees. However, there is no effective therapy to relieve the progression of knee OA. Metformin is a safe, well-tolerated oral medication that is extensively used as first-line therapy for type 2 diabetes. Previous observational studies and basic researches suggested that metformin may have protective effects on knee OA, which needs to be verified by clinical trials. This study, therefore, aims to examine the effects of metformin versus placebo on knee cartilage volume loss and knee symptoms in overweight knee OA patients by a randomized controlled trial over 24 months.

   METHODS: This protocol describes a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled clinical trial aiming to recruit 262 overweight knee OA patients. Participants will be randomly allocated to the two arms of the study, receiving metformin hydrochloride sustained-release tablets or identical inert placebo for 24 months (start from 0.5 g/day for the first 2 weeks, and increase to 1 g/day for the second 2 weeks, and further increase to 2 g/day for the remaining period if tolerated). Primary outcomes will be changes in tibiofemoral cartilage volume and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) score over 24 months. Secondary outcomes will be changes in visual analogue scale (VAS) knee pain, tibiofemoral cartilage defects, effusion-synovitis volume, and tibiofemoral bone marrow lesions maximum size over 24 months. The primary analyses will be intention-to-treat analyses of primary and secondary outcomes. Per-protocol analyses will be performed as the secondary analyses.

   DISCUSSION: If metformin is proved to slow knee cartilage volume loss and to relieve knee symptoms among overweight knee OA patients, it will have the potential to become a disease modifying drug for knee OA. Metformin is a convenient intervention with low cost, and its potential effects on slowing down the structural progression and relieving the symptoms of knee OA would effectively reduce the disease burden worldwide.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Tirzepatide is a novel dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist under development for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The aim of this substudy was to characterise the changes in liver fat content (LFC), volume of visceral adipose tissue (VAT), and abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (ASAT) in response to tirzepatide or insulin degludec in a subpopulation of the SURPASS-3 study.

   METHODS: This substudy of the randomised, open-label, parallel-group, phase 3 SURPASS-3 trial was done at 45 medical research centres and hospitals across eight countries (Argentina, Austria, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Romania, Spain, and the USA). Eligible participants were adults with type 2 diabetes, a baseline HbA1c 7.0-10.5% (53-91 mmol/mol), a BMI of at least 25 kg/m2, stable weight, were insulin-naive, and on treatment with metformin alone or in combination with a SGLT2 inhibitor for at least 3 months before screening. In addition to the main study inclusion criteria, substudy participants had a fatty liver index of at least 60. Participants had an MRI scan and were randomised (1:1:1:1) in the main study to subcutaneous injection once per week of tirzepatide 5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg, or subcutaneous injection once per day of titrated insulin degludec, using an interactive web-response system, and were stratified by country, HbA1c, and concomitant oral anti-hyperglycaemic medication. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in LFC (as measured by MRI-proton density fat fraction [MRI-PDFF]) at week 52 using pooled data from the tirzepatide 10 mg and 15 mg groups versus insulin degludec. Analyses were assessed in the enrolled MRI population, which consisted of participants in the modified intention-to-treat population of the main study who also had a valid MRI at either baseline or after baseline. This is a substudy of the trial registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT03882970, and is complete.

   FINDINGS: From April 1, 2019, to Nov 15, 2019, 502 participants were assessed for eligibility to participate in this substudy, 296 (59%) of whom were included in the enrolled MRI population and randomly assigned to treatment (tirzepatide 5 mg, n=71; tirzepatide 10 mg, n=79; tirzepatide 15 mg, n=72; and insulin degludec, n=74). Baseline demographics and clinical characteristics were similar across all treatment groups. From an overall mean baseline LFC of 15.71% (SD 8.93), the absolute reduction in LFC at week 52 was significantly greater for the pooled tirzepatide 10 mg and 15 mg groups (-8.09%, SE 0.57) versus the insulin degludec group (-3.38%, 0.83). The estimated treatment difference versus insulin degludec was -4.71% (95% CI -6.72 to -2.70; p<0.0001). The reduction in LFC was significantly correlated (p<=0.0006) with baseline LFC (rho=-0.71), reductions in VAT (rho=0.29), reductions in ASAT (rho=0.33), and reductions in body weight (rho=0.34) in the tirzepatide groups.

   INTERPRETATION: Tirzepatide showed a significant reduction in LFC and VAT and ASAT volumes compared with insulin degludec in this subpopulation of patients with type 2 diabetes in the SURPASS-3 study. These data provide additional evidence on the metabolic effects of this novel dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Tirzepatide, a dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP)/GLP-1 receptor agonist, shows a remarkable ability to lower blood glucose, enabling many patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes to achieve normoglycaemia. We aimed to understand the physiological mechanisms underlying the action of tirzepatide in type 2 diabetes.

   METHODS: This multicentre, randomised, double-blind, parallel-arm, phase 1 study was done at two centres in Germany. Eligible patients were aged 20-74 years, had type 2 diabetes for at least 6 months, and were being treated with lifestyle advice and stable doses of metformin, with or without one additional stable dose of another oral antihyperglycaemic medicine, 3 months before study entry. Via a randomisation table, patients were randomly assigned (3:3:2) to subcutaneously receive either tirzepatide 15 mg, semaglutide 1 mg, or placebo once per week. Endpoint measurements were done at baseline and the last week of therapy (week 28). The primary endpoint was the effect of tirzepatide versus placebo on the change in clamp disposition index (combining measures of insulin secretion and sensitivity) from baseline to week 28 of treatment and was analysed in the pharmacodynamic analysis set, which comprised all randomly assigned participants who received at least one dose of a study drug and had evaluable pharmacodynamic data. Safety was analysed in the safety population, which comprised all randomly assigned participants who received at least one dose of a study drug. Secondary endpoints included the effect of tirzepatide versus semaglutide on the change in clamp disposition index from baseline to week 28 of treatment, glucose control, total insulin secretion rate, M value (insulin sensitivity), and fasting and postprandial glucagon concentrations. Exploratory endpoints included the change in fasting and postprandial insulin concentrations. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03951753, and is complete.

   FINDINGS: Between June 28, 2019, and April 8, 2021, we screened 184 individuals and enrolled 117 participants, all of whom were included in the safety population (45 in the tirzepatide 15 mg group, 44 in the semaglutide 1 mg group, and 28 in the placebo group). Because of discontinuations and exclusions due to missing or unevaluable data, 39 patients in each treatment group and 24 patients in the placebo group comprised the pharmacodynamic analysis set. With tirzepatide, the clamp disposition index increased from a least squares mean of 0.3 pmol m-2 L min-2 kg-1 (SE 0.03) at baseline by 1.9 pmol m-2 L min-2 kg-1 (0.16) to total 2.3 pmol m-2 L min-2 kg-1 (SE 0.16) at week 28 and, with placebo, the clamp disposition index did not change much from baseline (least squares mean at baseline 0.4 pmol m-2 L min-2 kg-1 [SE 0.04]; change from baseline 0.0 pmol m-2 L min-2 kg-1 [0.03]; least squares mean at week 28 0.3 [SE 0.03]; estimated treatment difference [ETD] tirzepatide vs placebo 1.92 [95% CI 1.59-2.24]; p<0.0001). The improvement with tirzepatide in clamp disposition index was significantly greater than with semaglutide (ETD 0.84 pmol m-2 L min-2 kg-1 [95% CI 0.46-1.21]). This result reflected significant improvements in total insulin secretion rate (ETD 102.09 pmol min-1 m-2 [51.84-152.33]) and insulin sensitivity (ETD 1.52 mg min-1 kg-1 [0.53-2.52]) for tirzepatide versus semaglutide. On meal tolerance testing, tirzepatide significantly reduced glucose excursions (lower insulin and glucagon concentrations) compared with placebo, with effects on these variables being greater than with semaglutide. The safety profiles of tirzepatide and semaglutide were similar, with gastrointestinal adverse events being the most common (11 [24%], 13 [30%], and seven [25%] with nausea; nine [20%], 13 [30%], and six [21%] with diarrhoea; and three [7%], five [11%], and one [4%] with vomiting, for tirzepatide, semaglutide, and placebo, respectively). There were no deaths.

   INTERPRETATION: The glycaemic efficacy of GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist tirzepatide in type 2 diabetes results from concurrent improvements in key components of diabetes pathophysiology, namely beta-cell function, insulin sensitivity, and glucagon secretion. These effects were large and help to explain the remarkable glucose-lowering ability of tirzepatide seen in phase 3 studies.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Tirzepatide is a novel dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and GLP-1 receptor agonist under development for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. In this study, we used continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) to compare the 24 h glucose profile for participants given tirzepatide compared with those given insulin degludec.

   METHODS: This substudy of the open-label, parallel-group, phase 3 SURPASS-3 trial, was done at 45 sites across six countries (Hungary, Poland, Romania, Spain, Ukraine, and the USA). Eligible participants in the main study were adults with type 2 diabetes, a baseline HbA1c of 7.0-10.5% (53-91 mmol/mol), and a BMI of 25 kg/m2 or more, who were insulin-naive, and treated with metformin alone or in combination with a SGLT2 inhibitor for at least 3 months before screening. Participants in the main study were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to receive once-weekly subcutaneous injection of tirzepatide 5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg, or once-daily subcutaneous injection of titrated insulin degludec (100 U/mL), using an interactive web-response system. Participants were stratified by country, HbA1c concentration, and concomitant oral antihyperglycaemic medication. A subset of these patients with a normal wake-sleep cycle were enrolled into this substudy, and interstitial glucose values were collected by CGM for approximately 7 days at baseline, 24 weeks, and 52 weeks. The primary outcome was to compare pooled participants assigned to 10 mg and 15 mg tirzepatide versus insulin degludec for the proportion of time that CGM values were in the tight target range (71-140 mg/dL) at 52 weeks, assessed in all randomly assigned participants who received at least one dose of study drug and had an evaluable CGM session at either baseline or after baseline. The secondary outcomes were to compare tirzepatide (5 mg, 10 mg, and 15 mg) versus insulin degludec for the proportion and duration of time in tight target range at 24 and 52 weeks. This was a substudy of the trial registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03882970, and is complete.

   FINDINGS: From April 1 to Nov 27, 2019, 313 participants were screened for eligibility, 243 of whom were enrolled in CGM substudy (tirzepatide 5 mg, n=64; tirzepatide 10 mg, n=51; tirzepatide 15 mg, n=73; and insulin degludec, n=55). Patients given once-weekly tirzepatide (pooled 10 mg and 15 mg groups) had a greater proportion of time in tight target range compared with patients given insulin degludec (estimated treatment difference 25% [95% CI 16-33]; p<0.0001). Participants assigned to tirzepatide spent significantly more time in tight target range at 52 weeks compared with those assigned to insulin degludec (5 mg 12% [1-22], p=0.031; 10 mg 24% [13-35], p<0.0001; and 15 mg 25% [14-35], p<0.0001). Participants assigned to tirzepatide 10 mg and 15 mg, but not to tirzepatide 5 mg, spent significantly more time in tight target range at 24 weeks compared with insulin degludec (10 mg 19% [8-30], p=0.0008; 15 mg 21% [11-31], p<0.0001).

   INTERPRETATION: Once-weekly treatment with tirzepatide showed superior glycaemic control measured using CGM compared with insulin degludec in participants with type 2 diabetes on metformin, with or without a SGLT2 inhibitor. These new data provide additional evidence to the effect of tirzepatide and potential for achieving glycaemic targets without increase of hypoglycaemic risk compared with a basal insulin.

Abstract
  Metformin, the first-line therapy for type 2 diabetes (T2D), decreases hepatic glucose production and reduces fasting plasma glucose levels. Dorzagliatin, a dual-acting orally bioavailable glucokinase activator targeting both the pancreas and liver glucokinase, decreases postprandial glucose in patients with T2D. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial, the efficacy and safety of dorzagliatin as an add-on therapy to metformin were assessed in patients with T2D who had inadequate glycemic control using metformin alone. Eligible patients with T2D (n = 767) were randomly assigned to receive dorzagliatin or placebo (1:1 ratio) as an add-on to metformin (1,500 mg per day) for 24 weeks of double-blind treatment, followed by 28 weeks of open-label treatment with dorzagliatin for all patients. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels from baseline to week 24, and safety was assessed throughout the trial. At week 24, the least-squares mean change from baseline in HbA1c (95% confidence interval (CI)) was -1.02% (-1.11, -0.93) in the dorzagliatin group and -0.36% (-0.45, -0.26) in the placebo group (estimated treatment difference, -0.66%; 95% CI: -0.79, -0.53; P < 0.0001). The incidence of adverse events was similar between groups. There were no severe hypoglycemia events or drug-related serious adverse events in the dorzagliatin and metformin combined therapy group. In patients with T2D who experienced inadequate glycemic control with metformin alone, dorzagliatin resulted in effective glycemic control with good tolerability and safety profile ( NCT03141073 ).

Abstract
  Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is the most common form of diabetes. The initial treatment of type 2 DM consists of the adoption of healthy lifestyle habits together with several classes of hypoglycemic agents. However, these medications are not always able to reduce the blood glucose levels in all patients. Therefore, creatine supplementation has emerged as a new putative candidate for type 2 DM treatment. This systematic review aimed to investigate the effects (benefits and harms) of creatine supplementation in patients with type 2 diabetes through a systematic review. The studies were searched in MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, CENTRAL, SPORTDiscus, and CINAHL databases, without date or language restrictions. Methodological quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias table. The certainty of the evidence was classified using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. Three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included (87 participants). Overall, the methodological quality was classified as unclear to a high risk of bias. Each trial compared creatine supplementation with a different control group (placebo, metformin, and glibenclamide). Creatine supplementation seems to be effective in decreasing glycemic levels and glycosylated hemoglobin concentrations compared to placebo. No difference was observed compared to metformin or glibenclamide with creatine, and all treatments were able to reduce blood glucose levels. No major adverse effects were observed. Based on the low certainty of evidence, creatine supplementation was shown to be a hypoglycemic intervention for patients with type 2 diabetes, without major adverse events reported. However, well- designed RCTs with larger sample sizes and long-term outcomes are needed to support this evidence.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Treatment of diabetes mellitus includes more than one drug of different groups, which may lead to a high pill burden and non-adherence to drugs. We have aimed to systematically analyze the clinical efficacy, safety, and pharmacoeconomic cost-effectiveness of the fixed-dose combination of empagliflozin plus a linagliptin in Type-2 Diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients.

   METHODS: A literature search of PubMed/MEDLINE, SCOPUS, Google Scholar, and EMBASE was performed using the MeSH terms and/or keywords"((Single-pill combination) OR ((Fixeddose combination) OR (Combination therapy)) AND (Empagliflozin add on-to Linagliptin) OR (Empagliflozin combined with Linagliptin) OR ((Combination of Empagliflozin and Linagliptin)" from the inception to February 2021.

   RESULTS: Search results were found in a total of 13 clinical studies. After removing duplicates and studies not according to inclusion criteria, a total of eight clinical studies (Randomized controlled trials: 7; Observational cohort studies: 1) were included (n=7491). A significant reduction in the primary endpoint, the mean changes in baseline HbA1c at the end of 24 weeks and/or 52 weeks was found in the empagliflozin plus a linagliptin combination group in all included studies. In addition, significant efficacy was seen in decreasing the secondary endpoints such as the mean change in the fasting plasma glucose, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and body weight with fewer adverse events than the adverse effects with either drug alone.

   CONCLUSION: After reviewing findings from the available clinical studies of the combination of empagliflozin plus linagliptin, we conclude that the combination is effective, safe, tolerable, and rationale cost effective compared to placebo and either drug alone for the management of T2DM in patients with inadequate glycemic control with metformin alone, patients with intolerance to metformin, increased baseline HbA1c, patients with overweight or obesity and diabetic hypertensive, CHF, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and renal dysfunction patients. Future randomized controlled trials in a larger number of T2DM patients with or without CHF and renal failure patients are recommended.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: The comparative neuroprotective effects of different antidiabetes drugs have not been characterized in randomized controlled trials. Here, we investigated the therapeutic effects of liraglutide, dapagliflozin, or acarbose treatment on brain functional alterations and cognitive changes in patients with type 2 diabetes.

   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Thirty-six patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin monotherapy were randomized to receive liraglutide, dapagliflozin, or acarbose treatment for 16 weeks. Brain functional MRI (fMRI) scan and a battery of cognitive assessments were evaluated pre- and postintervention in all subjects.

   RESULTS: The 16-week treatment with liraglutide significantly enhanced the impaired odor-induced left hippocampal activation with Gaussian random field correction and improved cognitive subdomains of delayed memory, attention, and executive function (all P < 0.05), whereas dapagliflozin or acarbose did not. Structural equation modeling analysis demonstrated that such improvements of brain health and cognitive function could be partly ascribed to a direct effect of liraglutide on left hippocampal activation (beta = 0.330, P = 0.022) and delayed memory (beta = 0.410, P = 0.004) as well as to the metabolic ameliorations of reduced waist circumference, decreased body fat ratio, and elevated fasting insulin (all P < 0.05).

   CONCLUSIONS: Our head-to-head study demonstrated that liraglutide enhanced impaired brain activation and restored impaired cognitive domains in patients with type 2 diabetes, whereas dapagliflozin and acarbose did not. The results expand the clinical application of liraglutide and provide a novel treatment strategy for individuals with diabetes and a high risk of cognitive decline.

Abstract
  Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is the most common form of diabetes. The initial treatment of type 2 DM consists of the adoption of healthy lifestyle habits together with several classes of hypoglycemic agents. However, these medications are not always able to reduce the blood glucose levels in all patients. Therefore, creatine supplementation has emerged as a new putative candidate for type 2 DM treatment. This systematic review aimed to investigate the effects (benefits and harms) of creatine supplementation in patients with type 2 diabetes through a systematic review. The studies were searched in MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, CENTRAL, SPORTDiscus, and CINAHL databases, without date or language restrictions. Methodological quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias table. The certainty of the evidence was classified using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. Three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included (87 participants). Overall, the methodological quality was classified as unclear to a high risk of bias. Each trial compared creatine supplementation with a different control group (placebo, metformin, and glibenclamide). Creatine supplementation seems to be effective in decreasing glycemic levels and glycosylated hemoglobin concentrations compared to placebo. No difference was observed compared to metformin or glibenclamide with creatine, and all treatments were able to reduce blood glucose levels. No major adverse effects were observed. Based on the low certainty of evidence, creatine supplementation was shown to be a hypoglycemic intervention for patients with type 2 diabetes, without major adverse events reported. However, well- designed RCTs with larger sample sizes and long-term outcomes are needed to support this evidence.

Abstract
  AIMS: The association between metformin use and neurodegenerative disease (ND) onset remains controversial. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to determine the relationship between metformin use and ND risk based on data from population-based cohort studies.

   METHODS: Articles were systematically searched in PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Library databases. Pooled relative risks (RRs) with 95% CIs were obtained using a random-effects model. Subgroup analyses, sensitivity analyses and meta-regression were performed to identify the sources of heterogeneity and strengthen the results.

   RESULTS: Twelve population-based cohort studies involving 194,792 participants (94,462 metformin users and 100,330 metformin non-users) were eligible for inclusion in this meta-analysis. The pooled RR of NDs reached 0.77 (95% CI 0.67-0.88) when comparing metformin users with non-users. The effects were more prominent in long-term metformin users (>=4 years) (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.13-0.44) and studies from Asian countries (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.64-0.74). The effect estimates were stable when stratified by subtypes of NDs, study designs, and control definitions (p for interaction >0.05). Meta-regression did not identify the coefficients as the sources of heterogeneity (all p > 0.05).

   CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review and meta-analysis found that metformin use, especially long-term use, was associated with lower ND risk. However, because there was substantial heterogeneity among studies, high-quality randomized controlled trials are still needed to confirm this finding. Copyright © 2022 Diabetes UK.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Metformin and sulfonylureas are the most commonly prescribed drugs used for the treatment of type II diabetes. Type II diabetes has been linked to the development of keratinocyte carcinoma (KC), consisting of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Previously we have demonstrated lower risk for a subsequent KC in metformin users. In this study, we aim to investigate the association between sulfonylureas use and the development of KC in patients with KC history. We performed a retrospective cohort study of the Veterans Affairs Keratinocyte Carcinoma Chemoprevention Trial, which was a randomized double-blind vehicle-control cream originally investigating the effect of 5-fluorouracil on KC development. 932 patients with a history of KC were enrolled (98% male, 99% white, median age of 70 years) and followed for a median duration of 2.8 years. 153 patients were on metformin and 94 on sulfonylureas. We performed a survival analysis with cox regression and controlled for body mass index and known predictors: number of prior BCCs and age (for BCC) and for number of prior SCCs (invasive and in situ), number of actinic keratoses at baseline (for SCC). Sulfonylurea-users com-pared to non-users had a HR of 0.67 (CI: 0.40&ndash;1.56; P=0.49) and 0.94 (CI: 0.63&ndash;1.40; P= 0.77), for SCC and BCC, respectively. Diabetic patients at high risk for KC might benefit from the use of metformin versus sulfonylureas. J Drugs Dermatol. 2022;21(5):502-505. doi:10.36849/JDD.6087.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Soluble suppression of tumorigenesis-2 (sST2) and galectin (Gal)-3 are two biomarkers related to inflammation, metabolic disturbances and to myocardial fibrosis that characterize several cardiac pathological conditions. Increased circulating levels of these molecules have been associated with risk of cardiovascular death. Treatment with liraglutide, a glucagon-like peptide 1 analog, is associated with weight loss, improved glycemic control, and reduced cardiovascular risk. We wanted to assess (I) potential differences between subjects with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and healthy controls in sST2 and Gal-3 circulating levels, and their relationship with glycemic control and markers of beta cell function and myocardial injury; (II) whether liraglutide treatment modulates these markers in subjects with prediabetes or early T2DM independently of weight loss; (III) whether baseline levels of any of these two molecules may predict the response to liraglutide treatment.

   METHODS: Forty metformin-treated obese subjects (BMI >= 30) with prediabetes [impaired fasting glucose (IFG) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or both (n = 23)] or newly diagnosed T2DM (n = 17), were randomized to liraglutide or lifestyle counseling until achieving a comparable weight loss (7% of initial body weight). Thirteen subjects were enrolled as healthy controls for baseline sST2 and Gal-3 levels.

   RESULTS: Baseline sST2 levels were comparable between controls and obese patients (p = 0.79) whereas Gal-3 levels were significantly higher in patients as compared to controls (p < 0.001). Liraglutide treatment, but not weight loss achieved by lifestyle counseling, decreased plasma sST2 levels (- 9%, beta = - 14.9, standard deviation 6.9, p = 0.037) while Gal-3 levels did not change. A reduction in serum hs-Troponin I was observed after intervention, due to a 19% (p = 0.29) increase in the lifestyle arm, and a 25% decrease (p = 0.033) in the liraglutide arm (between-group difference p = 0.083). Lower baseline Gal-3 levels predicted a better improvement in beta cell function after liraglutide treatment.

   CONCLUSIONS: Liraglutide-induced reduction in sST2 and possibly hs-TnI suggests that in obese patients with prediabetes or early T2DM this drug may have a positive effect on (cardiac) fibrosis, whereas plasma level of Gal-3 before liraglutide initiation may predict response to the drug in terms of beta cell function improvement.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: We investigated trends in the proportion of diabetes treatment and glycemic control, which may be altered by recent advances in insulin and non-insulin drugs, in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes.

   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A serial cross-sectional study was performed using a multicenter large-population database from the Japan Diabetes Clinical Data Management study group. Patients with type 2 diabetes who attended clinics belonging to the study group between 2002 and 2018 were included to examine trends in glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) by treatment group using multivariable non-linear regression model.

   RESULTS: The proportion of patients with insulin only decreased from 15.0% to 3.6%, patients with insulin+non-insulin drugs increased from 8.1% to 15.1%, patients with non-insulin drugs increased from 50.8% to 67.0%, and those with no drugs decreased from 26.1% to 14.4% from 2002 to 2018, respectively. The HbA1c levels of each group, except for no drugs, continued to decrease until 2014 (unadjusted mean HbA1c (%) from 2002 to 2014: from 7.89 to 7.45 for insulin only, from 8.09 to 7.63 for insulin+non-insulin, and from 7.51 to 6.98 for non-insulin) and remained unchanged thereafter. Among insulin-treated patients, use of human insulin decreased, use of long-acting analog insulin increased, and concomitant use of non-insulin drugs increased (from 35.1% in 2002 to 80.9% in 2018), which included increased use of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists, and the persistently high use of metformin.

   CONCLUSIONS: During the past two decades, combined use of insulin and non-insulin drugs increased and glycemic control improved and leveled off after 2014 in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes. Further studies of the trend in association with age and factors related to metabolic syndrome are necessary to investigate strategies aiming at personalized medicine in diabetes care.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: The aim is to assess the comparative efficacy and safety of combination therapy with vildagliptin and metformin vs. metformin monotherapy in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched on PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Embase databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of combination therapy with vildagliptin and metformin vs. metformin monotherapy in patients with T2DM published up to 30 February 2021. The Cochrane tool and Revman 5.3 software was used to assess the risk of bias and conducted the meta-analysis in the included RCTs. Evidence level was assessed by the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

   RESULTS: A total of 11 RCTs and 8533 patients were included. For the efficacy, we found that combination therapy with vildagliptin and metformin (dose of metformin >=1500mg/d) had a significantly higher reduction in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) [mean differences (MD)= -0.59, 95% CI (-0.28, -0.16), p<0.00001] and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level [MD= -0.82, 95% CI (-1.09, -0.56), p<0.00001] than combination therapy with vildagliptin and metformin (dose of metformin <1500 mg/d). Vildagliptin plus metformin as combination therapy reduced body weight loss ratio [MD=0.22, 95% CI (0.17, 0.27), p<0.00001] when compared with metformin monotherapy. In terms of safety, the vildagliptin plus metformin as combination therapy did not increase risk of total adverse events (AEs) [RR=0.98, 95% CI (0.94,1.02), p=0.29], however there were significant statistical difference and did not increase the risk of diarrhea [RR=0.55, 95% CI (0.40, 0.76), p=0.0003] and Gastrointestinal (GI) disorders [RR=0.72, 95% CI (0.58, 0.91), p=0.006], but significantly increased risk of dizziness [RR=1.41, 95% CI (1.06, 1.88), p=0.02] when compared with metformin monotherapy.

   CONCLUSIONS: Compared with metformin, vildagliptin combined with metformin could significantly reduce FPG, HbA1c and body weight. When the dose of metformin in the combination group of vildagliptin and metformin is >=1500mg/d, the results showed significant reduction in HbA1c and FPG. In addition, it had no risk of increase in total AEs, diarrhea, and GI disorders, but had significant risk of increase in dizziness. GRADE showed that the quality of evidence had high certainty in FPG and moderate certainty in HbA1c, body weight and all AEs.

Abstract
  AIMS: Our study assesses perinatal outcomes among women with type 2 diabetes, with gestational weight gain (GWG) within and outside of US Institute of Medicine (IOM) guidelines, by conducting a secondary analysis of the Metformin in Type 2 Diabetes in Pregnancy (MiTy) trial.

   METHODS: 460 participants were classified into three cohorts by total and weekly GWG (excessive, appropriate vs. restricted according to IOM). The primary outcome was birthweight z score, and secondary outcomes included both maternal and fetal outcomes.

   RESULTS: Women with restricted (total and weekly) GWG had lower birthweight z score, lower fetal birthweight, and lower neonatal body fat mass. Women with restricted weekly GWG had fewer LGA, extreme LGA, and lower neonatal body fat mass infants, but more SGA and preterm births. Women with excessive (total and weekly) GWG had higher maternal total insulin doses in the third trimester. Women with excessive weekly GWG had more preeclampsia and higher SGA.

   CONCLUSIONS: Restricted GWG among women with type 2 diabetes is associated with both benefits and harms. Both must be considered when counseling patients. Copyright © 2022. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Abstract
  AIMS: Examine the efficacy of metformin compared to placebo or other glucose-lowering medications on microvascular outcomes in patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM).

   METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Scopus were searched from database inception to March 2020. We included randomized clinical trials of patients with T2DM receiving metformin compared with another active glucose-lowering treatment or placebo in which a microvascular outcome was assessed. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Microvascular complications included kidney-related outcomes, retinopathy, and peripheral neuropathy. An inverse-weighted variance random-effect meta-analysis was performed to estimate drugs effect over microvascular disease. PROSPERO (CRD42019120365).

   RESULTS: Nineteen RCTs (n = 18,181) were included. Metformin increased estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) by a mean difference (MD) of 1.08 (95% CI 0.84 to 1.33 ml/min/1.73 m2) after 24 weeks. No effect was found on urinary albumin-creatinine ratio, serum creatinine, and end-stage kidney disease; Patient-important outcomes regarding kidney disease, retinal outcomes, peripheral neuropathy or quality of life were not assessed by any of the included studies and could not be analyzed.

   CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence of clinically significant beneficial effect of metformin therapy as compared to other glucose-lowering medications or placebo on the examined microvascular complications. Copyright © 2022. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Abstract
  AIMS: To compare the efficacy and safety of antihyperglycemic agents, taken in combination with metformin, for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

   METHODS: A previous 2016 comprehensive search of Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, and Cochrane CENTRAL was updated to October 2018, and a systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) was conducted. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of patients with T2DM taking an antihyperglycemic agent in combination with metformin were included. Bayesian NMA was performed to assess the relative efficacy and safety of the antihyperglycemic classes.

   RESULTS: In total, 204 RCTs were included, which assessed the efficacy and safety of eight antihyperglycemic drug classes (i.e., sulfonylureas, meglitinides, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, thiazolidinediones, basal and biphasic insulin, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors, glucagon-like-peptide-1 receptor agonists and sodium-glucose cotransport-2 inhibitors). All drug classes significantly reduced haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) compared to metformin monotherapy (mean reduction from 0.50 to 0.92). The drug classes varied in their relative effects on hypoglycemia, body weight, body mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, high and low density lipoprotein cholesterol, and the classes had differing safety profiles on total adverse events, urogenital adverse events, heart failure, serious adverse events, and withdraw due to adverse events.

   CONCLUSIONS: All eight antihyperglycemic drug classes, taken in combination with metformin, reduced HbA1c levels; however, the effects of the agents on other outcomes varied among the classes. Copyright © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Inflammation is closely associated with atherosclerosis and plays a crucial role in the development of cardiovascular disease. Metformin sensitizes body cells to insulin, which may cause a reduction of atherogenic lipid fractions. Low neuregulin-4 (Nrg-4) levels, an adipokine, are linked to obesity, insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes.

   OBJECTIVES: We assessed the effect of oral supplementation with metformin on glycemic control, neuregulin-4 levels and carotid intima media thickness (CIMT) as a marker for subclinical atherosclerosis in adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and microvascular complications.

   METHODS: This randomized placebo-controlled trial included 80 type 1 diabetic patients with microvascular complications who were randomly divided to receive either 24 weeks of metformin 500 mg/day or matching placebo. Fasting blood glucose (FBG), HbA1c, C-reactive protein (CRP), urinary albumin creatinine ratio (UACR), lipid profile, Nrg-4 and CIMT were assessed at baseline and study end.

   RESULTS: Both groups were well-matched as regards baseline clinical and laboratory data (p greater than 0.05). After 24-weeks, metformin therapy for the intervention group resulted in a significant decrease of HbA1c, CRP, UACR, total cholesterol and CIMT while Nrg-4 levels were increased compared with baseline levels (p < 0.001) and with placebo group(p < 0.001). Baseline Nrg-4 levels were negatively correlated to FBG, HbA1c, total cholesterol, CRP and CIMT. Metformin was well-tolerated.

   CONCLUSIONS: Oral metformin supplementation once daily for 24 weeks as an adjuvant therapy to intensive insulin in pediatric T1DM was safe and effective in improving glycemic control, dyslipidemia and Nrg-4 levels; hence, it decreased inflammation, microvascular complications and subclinical atherosclerosis.

Abstract
  Metformin is the most used drug for type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Its antitumor activity has been described by clinical studies showing reduced risk of cancer development in T2DM patients, as well as management of T2DM compared with those receiving other glucose-lowering drugs. Metformin has a plethora of molecular actions in cancer cells. This review focused on in vitro data on the action mechanisms of metformin on thyroid, prostate and head and neck cancer. AMPK activation regulating specific downstream targets is a constant antineoplastic activity in different types of cancer; however, AMPK-independent mechanisms are also relevant. In vitro evidence makes it clear that depending on the type of tumor, metformin has different actions; its effects may be modulated by different cell conditions (for instance, presence of HPV infection), or it may regulate tissue-specific factors, such as the Na+/I- symporter (NIS) and androgen receptors. The hallmarks of cancer are a set of functional features acquired by the cell during malignant development. In vitro studies show that metformin regulates almost all the hallmarks of cancer. Interestingly, metformin is one of these therapeutic agents with the potential to synergize with other chemotherapeutic agents, with low cost, low side effects and high positive consequences. Some questions are still challenging: Are metformin in vitro data able to translate from bench to bedside? Does metformin affect drug resistance? Can metformin be used as a generic anticancer drug for all types of tumors? Which are the specific actions of metformin on the peculiarities of each type of cancer? Several clinical trials are in progress or have been concluded for repurposing metformin as an anticancer drug. The continuous efforts in the field and future in vitro studies will be essential to corroborate clinical trials results and to elucidate the raised questions.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Clinical trials indicate the efficacy of add-on therapy using incretin-related drugs to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) inadequately controlled by insulin. However, heterogeneity exists among these studies. Baseline body mass index (BMI) accounts for the heterogeneity of add-on therapy with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors and the associated higher BMI with a lower efficacy. The efficacy of add-on therapy with glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists remains unclear.

   METHODS: We performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of >=12 weeks reporting the endpoint of adjusted mean change in hemoglobin A1c levels (AMDELTAHbA1c) or hypoglycemia incidence. Patients with type 2 DM treated with insulin alone or with metformin for at least 8 weeks before the study treatment were included. The intervention group received liraglutide co-administered with insulin or a fixed-dose combination. The control group received a placebo or insulin. Covariates included five baseline parameters (HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose, BMI, type 2 DM duration, and treatment duration).

   RESULTS: Seven studies (2067 patients) were selected. AMDELTAHbA1c was -1.00% (95% confidence interval [CI]: -1.21 to -0.78, I2 = 74.7%). The odds ratio for hypoglycemia incidence was 0.97 (95% CI: 0.50-1.87, I2 = 81.9%). Covariates did not account for the heterogeneity in AMDELTAHbA1c or hypoglycemia incidence.

   CONCLUSIONS: Liraglutide add-on therapy reduced HbA1c levels without increasing hypoglycemia incidence, independent of BMI, in insulin non-responders with type 2 DM. GLP-1 receptor agonists may be more suitable than DPP-4 inhibitors for add-on therapy in patients with high BMI.

Abstract
  STUDY QUESTION: Does acupuncture improve insulin sensitivity more effectively than metformin or sham acupuncture in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and insulin resistance (IR)?

   SUMMARY ANSWER: Among women with PCOS and IR, acupuncture was not more effective than metformin or sham acupuncture in improving insulin sensitivity.

   WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Uncontrolled trials have shown that acupuncture improved insulin sensitivity with fewer side effects compared with metformin in women with PCOS and IR. However, data from randomized trials between acupuncture and metformin or sham acupuncture are lacking.

   STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This was a three-armed randomized controlled trial enrolling a total of 342 women with PCOS and IR from three hospitals between November 2015 and February 2018, with a 3-month follow-up until October 2018.

   PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Women aged from 18 to 40 years with PCOS and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) >=2.14 were randomly assigned (n = 114 per group) to receive true acupuncture plus placebo (true acupuncture), metformin plus sham acupuncture (metformin, 0.5 g three times daily) or sham acupuncture plus placebo (sham acupuncture) for 4 months, with an additional 3-month follow-up. True or sham acupuncture was given three times per week, and 0.5 g metformin or placebo was given three times daily. The primary outcome was change in HOMA-IR from baseline to 4 months after baseline visit. Secondary outcomes included changes in the glucose AUC during an oral glucose tolerance test, BMI and side effects at 4 months after baseline visit.

   MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: After 4 months of treatment, the changes of HOMA-IR were -0.5 (decreased 14.7%) in the true acupuncture group, -1.0 (decreased 25.0%) in the metformin group and -0.3 (decreased 8.6%) in the sham acupuncture group, when compared with baseline. True acupuncture is not as effective as metformin in improving HOMA-IR at 4 months after baseline visit (difference, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.1-1.1). No significant difference was found in change in HOMA-IR between true and sham acupuncture groups at 4 months after baseline visit (difference, -0.2; 95% CI, -0.7 to 0.3). During the 4 months of treatment, gastrointestinal side effects were more frequent in the metformin group, including diarrhea, nausea, loss of appetite, fatigue, vomiting and stomach discomfort (31.6%, 13.2%, 11.4%, 8.8%, 14.0% and 8.8%, respectively). Bruising was more common in the true acupuncture group (14.9%).

   LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: This study might have underestimated the sample size in the true acupuncture group with 4 months of treatment to enable detection of statistically significant changes in HOMA-IR with fixed acupuncture (i.e. a non-personalized protocol). Participants who withdrew because of pregnancy did not have further blood tests and this can introduce bias.

   WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: True acupuncture did not improve insulin sensitivity as effectively as metformin in women with PCOS and IR, but it is better than metformin in improving glucose metabolism (which might reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes) and has less side effects. Metformin had a higher incidence of gastrointestinal adverse effects than acupuncture groups, and thus acupuncture might be a non-pharmacological treatment with low risk for women with PCOS. Further studies are needed to evaluate the effect of acupuncture combined with metformin on insulin sensitivity in these women.

Abstract
  PURPOSE: The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) pathway controls insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism. Hyperglycemia is one of the most common on-target adverse effects (AEs) of PI3K/AKT inhibitors. As several PI3K and AKT inhibitors are approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration or are being studied in clinical trials, characterizing this AE and developing a management strategy is essential.

   METHODS: Patients with hematologic or solid malignancies treated at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center with a PI3K or AKT inhibitor were included in this retrospective analysis. A search for patients experiencing hyperglycemia was performed. The frequency, management interventions and outcomes were characterized.

   RESULTS: Four hundred and ninety-one patients with 10 unique cancer types who received a PI3K or AKT inhibitor were included. Twelve percent of patients required a dose interruption, 6% of patients required a dose reduction and 2% of patients were hospitalized to manage hyperglycemia. No events occurred among patients receiving beta-, gamma-, or delta- specific PI3K inhibitor. There was one case where the PI3K or AKT inhibitor was permanently discontinued due to hyperglycemia. Metformin was the most commonly used antidiabetic medication, followed by insulin, sodium-glucose transport protein 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, and sulfonylurea. SGLT2 inhibitors were associated with the greatest reductions in blood sugar, followed by metformin. At least one case of euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) occurred in a patient on PI3K inhibitor and SGLT2 inhibitor. Body mass index >= 25 and HbA1c >= 5.7 are were independently significant predictors of developing hyperglycemia.

   CONCLUSION: Hyperglycemia is one of the major on-target side effects of PI3K and AKT inhibitors. It is manageable with antidiabetic medications, treatment interruption and/or dose modification. We summarize pharmacological interventions that may be considered for PI3K/AKT inhibitor induced hyperglycemia. SGLT2-inhibitor may be a particularly effective second-line option after metformin but there is a low risk of euglycemic DKA, which can be deadly. To our knowledge, our report is the largest study of hyperglycemia in patients receiving PI3K/AKT inhibitors. Copyright © 2022 The Authors. Cancer Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Abstract
  Metformin has been in clinical use for the management of type 2 diabetes for more than 60 years and is supported by a vast database of clinical experience: this includes evidence for cardioprotection from randomised trials and real-world studies. Recently, the position of metformin as first choice glucose-lowering agent has been supplanted to some extent by the emergence of newer classes of antidiabetic therapy, namely the sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists. These agents have benefitted through support from large cardiovascular outcomes trials with more modern trial designs than earlier studies conducted to assess metformin. Nevertheless, clinical research on metformin continues to further assess its many potentially advantageous effects. Here, we review the evidence for improved cardiovascular outcomes with metformin in the context of the current era of diabetes outcomes trials. Focus is directed towards the potentially cardioprotective actions of metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes and heart failure (HF), now recognised as the most common complication of diabetes.

Abstract
  IMPORTANCE: A growing body of evidence suggests that adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs), including hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, gestational diabetes (GD), preterm birth, and intrauterine growth restriction, are associated with increased risk of cardiometabolic disease and cardiovascular disease (CVD) later in life. Adverse pregnancy outcomes may therefore represent an opportunity to intervene to prevent or delay onset of CVD. The objective of this review was to summarize the current evidence for targeted postpartum interventions and strategies to reduce CVD risk in women with a history of APOs.

   OBSERVATIONS: A search of PubMed and Ovid for English-language randomized clinical trials, cohort studies, descriptive studies, and guidelines published from January 1, 2000, to April 30, 2021, was performed. Four broad categories of interventions were identified: transitional clinics, lifestyle interventions, pharmacotherapy, and patient and clinician education. Observational studies suggest that postpartum transitional clinics identify women who are at elevated risk for CVD and may aid in the transition to longitudinal primary care. Lifestyle interventions to increase physical activity and improve diet quality may help reduce the incidence of type 2 diabetes in women with prior GD; less is known about women with other prior APOs. Metformin hydrochloride may prevent development of type 2 diabetes in women with prior GD. Evidence is lacking in regard to specific pharmacotherapies after other APOs. Cardiovascular guidelines endorse using a history of APOs to refine CVD risk assessment and guide statin prescription for primary prevention in women with intermediate calculated 10-year CVD risk. Research suggests a low level of awareness of the link between APOs and CVD among both patients and clinicians.

   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that transitional clinics, lifestyle intervention, targeted pharmacotherapy, and clinician and patient education represent promising strategies for improving postpartum maternal cardiometabolic health in women with APOs; further research is needed to develop and rigorously evaluate these interventions. Future efforts should focus on strategies to increase maternal postpartum follow-up, improve accessibility to interventions across diverse racial and cultural groups, expand awareness of sex-specific CVD risk factors, and define evidence-based precision prevention strategies for this high-risk population.

Abstract
  The progression of chronic kidney disease is difficult to stop once established. Metformin and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors show promise, but clinical trials with a head-to-head comparison in patients with more advanced (stage 3b-4) chronic kidney disease are largely lacking, partly for safety reasons. In this issue, Corremans et al. compare the effects of metformin and canagliflozin in rats with adenine-induced moderate (stage 2-4) chronic kidney disease. Metformin halted progression, whereas canagliflozin did not. This commentary puts the results in a wider clinical context. Copyright © 2022 International Society of Nephrology.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP), a biomarker of gut barrier permeability to lipopolysaccharides, is higher in adults with obesity and type 2 diabetes. Behavioral weight loss and metformin have distinct effects on the gut microbiome, but their impact on gut permeability to lipopolysaccharides is unknown. This study's objective was to determine the effects of a behavioral weight-loss intervention or metformin treatment on plasma LBP.

   SUBJECTS/METHODS: SPIRIT was a randomized trial of adults with overweight or obesity. Participants were randomized to one of three arms: metformin treatment, coach-directed behavioral weight loss on a DASH diet, or self-directed care (control). Of 121 participants, a random subset (n = 88) was selected to have LBP measured at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months post intervention. Intervention effects on LBP over time were assessed using generalized estimating equations (GEE). We also examined whether the intervention effects were modified by change in diet and weight.

   RESULTS: Arms were balanced by sex (83% female), race (51% white), and age (mean 60 years), with no differences in baseline LBP (median 4.23 mug/mL). At 1 year, mean weight change was -3.00% in the metformin arm, -3.02% in the coach-directed behavioral weight-loss arm, and +0.33% in the self-directed (control) arm. The corresponding change in LBP was +1.03, -0.98, +1.03 mug/mL. The behavioral weight-loss intervention reduced LBP compared to self-directed care (beta = -0.17, 95% CI: -0.33 to -0.01); no other between-arm comparisons were significant. Behavioral weight-loss participants who reduced dietary fat showed the greatest reductions in 6-month LBP (beta = -2.84, 95% CI: -5.17 to -0.50).

   CONCLUSIONS: Despite similar weight loss in the behavioral weight loss arm and the metformin arm, only the behavioral weight-loss intervention reduced LBP compared to control. Lifestyle weight-loss interventions that promote a DASH diet may be effective at reducing gut barrier permeability to lipopolysaccharides.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: People living with diabetes in low-resource settings may be at increased hypoglycemia risk due to food insecurity and limited access to glucose monitoring. We aimed to assess hypoglycemia risk associated with sulphonylurea (SU) and insulin therapy in people living with type 2 diabetes in a low-resource sub-Saharan African setting.

   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This study was conducted in the outpatients' diabetes clinics of two hospitals (one rural and one urban) in Uganda. We used blinded continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and self-report to compare hypoglycemia rates and duration in 179 type 2 diabetes patients treated with sulphonylureas (n=100) and insulin (n=51) in comparison with those treated with metformin only (n=28). CGM-assessed hypoglycemia was defined as minutes per week below 3mmol/L (54mg/dL) and number of hypoglycemic events below 3.0 mmol/L (54 mg/dL) for at least 15 minutes.

   RESULTS: CGM recorded hypoglycemia was infrequent in SU-treated participants and did not differ from metformin: median minutes/week of glucose <3 mmol/L were 39.2, 17.0 and 127.5 for metformin, sulphonylurea and insulin, respectively (metformin vs sulphonylurea, p=0.6). Hypoglycemia risk was strongly related to glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and fasting glucose, with most episodes occurring in those with tight glycemic control. After adjusting for HbA1c, time <3 mmol/L was 2.1 (95% CI 0.9 to 4.7) and 5.5 (95% CI 2.4 to 12.6) times greater with sulphonylurea and insulin, respectively, than metformin alone.

   CONCLUSIONS: In a low-resource sub-Saharan African setting, hypoglycemia is infrequent among people with type 2 diabetes receiving sulphonylurea treatment, and the modest excess occurs predominantly in those with tight glycemic control.

Abstract
  Background: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a common comorbidity in people living with HIV (PLWH). Anti-hyperglycemic treatment in PLWH is still a challenge, and no randomized controlled studies using new glucose-lowering agents are currently available.

   Case Description: A 55-year-old-women was admitted to our Diabetes Unit because of hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) and sepsis. The medical history included HIV infection and insulin-treated diabetes. On clinical examination, the lady appeared dehydrated with dry buccal mucosa, tachycardia, altered mental status, genital infection, and fever. On admission, plasma glucose was 54.5 mmol/L, HbA1c 155 mmol/mol, osmolarity 389.4 mOsm/kg, bicarbonate 24.6 mmol/L with no detectable serum ketones. The patient was treated with i.v. fluid and insulin, and antibiotic therapy commenced. Upon HHS and sepsis resolution, a basal-bolus insulin therapy was implemented that was followed by significant improvement of daily glucose profiles and progressive reduction of insulin requirement until complete discontinuation. A low dose of metformin plus linagliptin was started. Since a severe atherosclerotic disease was diagnosed, a GLP-1 receptor agonist, dulaglutide, was added to metformin upon linagliptin withdrawal with maintenance of good glycemic control, treatment adherence and amelioration of quality of life and no side effects.

   Conclusion: This case suggests that GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy may be effective and safe for treatment of T2D with high cardiovascular risk in PLWH, supporting the need of clinical trials directly assessing the safety and the efficacy of GLP-1 receptor agonist in these individuals.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: The main aim was to study whether the long-term incidences of type 2 diabetes, pre-diabetes and metabolic syndrome differed between women who were treated with metformin or insulin for gestational diabetes.

   MATERIAL AND METHODS: This 9-year follow-up study of two open-label randomized trials compares metformin and insulin treatments of gestational diabetes. In all, 165 women, 88 previously treated with insulin and 77 treated with metformin in the index pregnancy, were included in the analyses. An oral glucose tolerance test was performed, and measures of anthropometry, glucose metabolism, serum lipids and inflammatory markers were compared between the treatment groups. Disorders of glucose metabolism (pre-diabetes and type 2 diabetes) at the 9-year follow-up was the primary outcome of this study. This study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02417090.

   RESULTS: The incidences of pre-diabetes and type 2 diabetes (40.3% vs. 46.6%, odds ratio [OR] 0.77, 95% CI 0.40-1.50, p = 0.51), type 2 diabetes (14.3% vs. 15.9%, OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.34-2.26, p = 0.94), pre-diabetes (26.0% vs. 30.7%, OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.38-1.65, p = 0.62), and metabolic syndrome (45.9% vs. 55.2%, OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.35-1.35, p = 0.31) were comparable between the metformin and insulin groups. Moreover, there were no evident differences in the individual measures of anthropometry, glucose metabolism including HOMA-insulin resistance, serum lipids or inflammatory markers between the two treatment groups.

   CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of gestational diabetes with metformin vs. insulin during pregnancy is unlikely to have diverging long-term effects on maternal anthropometry, glucose metabolism or serum lipids. From this perspective, both treatments may be considered in gestational diabetes. Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Antidiabetic medications (ADMs) may modify prostate cancer (PCa) risk in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). Accordingly, the current study assessed the possible associations between ADMs and the risk of PCa in diabetics.

   METHODS: A systematic literature search (PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library) identified studies evaluating the associations between ADMs and incidence of PCa. A meta-analysis followed PRISMA was performed using odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) as effect measures.

   RESULTS: In total of 47 studies involving 3094,152 patients with diabetes were included. Results of meta-analysis of the observational studies suggested no significant association between metformin, thiazolidinediones, sulfonylureas, insulin or dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors administration and the risk of PCa (All p-values > 0.05). Separate analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) revealed a significant reduction in PCa risk with thiazolidinediones (OR = 0.55, p = 0.04) or glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) administration (OR = 0.53, p = 0.006), whereas no significant association was found in SGLT2 inhibitors (p = 0.3).

   CONCLUSION: Thiazolidinediones or GLP-1RA administration may have benefits in PCa based on RCTs, however, further research is needed to confirm these findings. Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  Remogliflozin Etabonate (RE) & Vildagliptin are twice-daily medications that are individually approved and widely used in India for the treatment of diabetes. A single pill fixed dose combination of RE & Vildagliptin was formulated as potential pharmaco-therapeutic agent that would not only offer beneficial pharmacologic effects, but also reduces the pill burden, leading to a simplified treatment regimen with better treatment compliance. The fixed dose combination (FDC) of Remogliflozin + Vildagliptin added on to Metformin has been evaluated in this pivotal phase III study.

   MATERIAL: This 16 week, multi-centric, prospective, double blind, double dummy, parallel group, randomized controlled study compared efficacy and safety of FDC of RE 100mg + Vildagliptin 50mg (RV) given twice daily with active comparator of Empagliflozin 25mg +Linagliptin 5mg (EL) given once daily. Adult T2DM patients with HbA1c 8-11% on Metformin stable dose of >=1500mg for >=8 weeks before screening were randomized to either of treatment arms. The study endpoints were mean changes from baseline (CFB) in HbA1c (primary), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), post-prandial plasma glucose (PPG), body weight (BW) and blood pressure (BP) for efficacy and adverse events (AE) monitoring for safety assessments.

   OBSERVATION: Of 400 eligible subjects (200 in each arm), 357 (89.3%) subjects completed the study. The baseline demographic characteristics were well balanced between 2 treatment arms. In the mITT population, the least squares (LS) mean (SE) change from baseline in HbA1c levels at week 16 was -1.46% (0.098) in the RV arm and -1.38% (0.100) in the EL arm (p < 0.001 for within group change from baseline). The mean difference of -0.08% (95%CI: -0.28, 0.13) in HbA1c demonstrated non-inferiority (NI) of RV compared to EL (p<0.001 for NI test). Similarly, significant reduction was observed in FPG, PPG, BW and BP which was found to be comparable between the two treatment arms. Drug related AEs were observed in 5.5% and 4.5% subjects of EL and RV arm respectively, with low incidence of hypoglycemia, genital and urinary tract infections (0.5-3%).

   CONCLUSION: Overall, FDC of Remogliflozin Etabonate + Vildagliptin added on to Metformin was found to be efficacious and well tolerated in the treatment of patients with T2DM, and demonstrated non-inferiority to Empagliflozin 25mg + Linagliptin 5mg treatment added on to Metformin.

Abstract
  AIMS: To demonstrate the noninferiority of alogliptin to acarbose, in terms of antidiabetic efficacy, in Chinese people with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes (T2D) and high cardiovascular risk.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: ACADEMIC (NCT03794336) was a randomized, open-label, phase IV study conducted at 46 sites in China. Antidiabetic treatment-naive or metformin-treated adults with uncontrolled T2D (glycated haemoglobin [HbA1c] 58.0-97.0 mmol/mol) were randomized 2:1 to alogliptin 25 mg once daily or acarbose 100 mg three times daily for 16 weeks. All participants had a documented history of coronary heart disease or high cardiovascular risk at screening and received aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) 100 mg daily throughout the trial. The primary endpoints were change in HbA1c versus baseline, and the incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events (AEs). Safety and tolerability were also assessed.

   RESULTS: A total of 1088 participants were randomized. Alogliptin was noninferior to acarbose for the change in Week-16 HbA1c (least-squares mean change [standard error] -11.9 [0.4] vs. -11.4 [0.5] mmol/mol, respectively; difference between arms -0.5 [0.7] mmol/mol; 95% confidence interval -1.9 to 0.8 mmol/mol), and was associated with a lower incidence of gastrointestinal AEs (8.9% vs. 33.6%, respectively; P < 0.0001). More alogliptin than acarbose recipients achieved HbA1c <53.0 mmol/mol without gastrointestinal AEs (48.0% vs. 32.7%; P < 0.0001). Discontinuations due to treatment-related AEs were less frequent with alogliptin than acarbose (0.3% vs. 2.5%).

   CONCLUSIONS: Glycaemic control was comparable between alogliptin and acarbose, but the gastrointestinal tolerability of alogliptin was better. More patients achieved target HbA1c without gastrointestinal AEs with alogliptin, suggesting that this agent may be preferred in clinical practice. Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

Abstract
  We report the findings of a single-dose, randomized, three-period cross-over, clinical trial in healthy Chinese individuals (n = 24) comparing the pharmacokinetics of insulin degludec/liraglutide (IDegLira) with its individual components. Furthermore, we report a population pharmacokinetic analysis of a 26-week, phase III, treat-to-target, randomized trial of 720 Chinese individuals with type 2 diabetes. Participants were randomized to IDegLira, degludec or liraglutide, all once daily with metformin. The pharmacokinetic profiles of IDegLira were similar to its individual components. Dose proportionality was indicated for both IDegLira components. Although there were no relevant covariate effects on degludec exposure, liraglutide exposure was inversely correlated with bodyweight. In conclusion, for the Chinese population, the pharmacokinetics of the fixed-ratio combination IDegLira is similar to that of its individual components. Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex endocrine condition affecting women of reproductive age. It is characterized by insulin resistance and is a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The objective was to review the literature on the effect of different pharmacological interventions on insulin resistance in women with PCOS.

   DESIGN: We searched PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus, Embase, Cochrane library and the Web of Science in April 2020 and updated in March 2021. The study follows the 2020 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-ana. Reviwers extracted data and assessed the risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias tool.

   RESULTS: In 58 randomized controlled trials there were significant reductions in the fasting blood glucose (FBG) with metformin versus placebo (standardized mean difference [SMD]: -0.23; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.40, -0.06; I2 = 0%, low-grade evidence), and acarbose versus metformin (mean difference [MD]: -10.50 mg/dl; 95% CI: -15.76, -5.24; I2 = 0%, low-grade evidence). Significant reductions in fasting insulin (FI) with pioglitazone versus placebo (SMD: -0.55; 95% CI: -1.03, -0.07; I2 = 37%; p = .02, very-low-grade evidence). A significant reduction in homoeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was seen with exenatide versus metformin (MD: -0.34; 95% CI: -0.65, -0.03; I2 = 0%, low-grade evidence). No effect on homoeostatic model assessment of beta cells (HOMA-B) was observed.

   CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacological interventions, including metformin, acarbose, pioglitazone and exenatide have significant effects on FBG, FI, HOMA-IR but not on HOMA-B. Copyright © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic progressive lung disease with high morbidity and limited treatment options. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a common comorbid illness among patients with IPF and is often treated with metformin, the first-line agent in the management of T2DM. There is growing evidence demonstrating metformin's anti-fibrotic properties; however, there is little real-world clinical data regarding its potential effectiveness in IPF. This study aims to evaluate the clinical benefit of metformin in patients with IPF and T2DM.

   METHODS: This nationwide cohort study used de-identified administrative claims data from OptumLabs R Data Warehouse to identify 3599 adults with IPF and concomitant T2DM between January 1, 2014 and June 30, 2019. Two cohorts were created: a cohort treated with metformin (n = 1377) and a cohort not treated with metformin (n = 2222). A final 1:1 propensity score-matched cohort compared 1100 patients with IPF and T2DM receiving metformin to those with both diagnoses but not receiving metformin; matching accounted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, residence region, year, medications, oxygen use, smoking status, healthcare use, and comorbidities. Outcomes were all-cause mortality (primary) and hospitalizations (secondary).

   RESULTS: Among 2200 patients with IPF and T2DM included in this matched analysis, metformin therapy was associated with a reduction in all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 0.46; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.36-0.58; p < 0.001) and hospitalizations (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.72-0.93; p = 0.003) compared to patients not receiving metformin.

   CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with IPF and T2DM, metformin therapy may be associated with improved clinical outcomes. However, further investigation with randomized clinical trials is necessary prior to metformin's broad implementation in the clinical management of IPF. Copyright © 2022. The Author(s).

Abstract
  Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer and the leading cause of cancer-related death among women worldwide. Type 2 diabetes-associated metabolic traits such as hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, inflammation, oxidative stress, and obesity are well-known risk factors for breast cancer. The insulin sensitizer metformin, one of the most prescribed oral antidiabetic drugs, has been suggested to function as an antitumoral agent, based on epidemiological and retrospective clinical data as well as preclinical studies showing an antiproliferative effect in cultured breast cancer cells and animal models. These benefits provided a strong rationale to study the effects of metformin in routine clinical care of breast cancer patients. However, the initial enthusiasm was tempered after disappointing results in randomized controlled trials, particularly in the metastatic setting. Here, we revisit the current state of the art of metformin mechanisms of action, critically review past and current metformin-based clinical trials, and briefly discuss future perspectives on how to incorporate metformin into the oncologist's armamentarium for the prevention and treatment of breast cancer.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Electronic consultation (eConsultation) offers a potential mechanism to increase access to specialty care, address knowledge gaps, and overcome therapeutic inertia in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) being managed by primary care physicians (PCPs).

   OBJECTIVE: To develop and implement a system to provide unsolicited endocrinology eConsult for T2DM patients with HbA1c 8.5-10.5% managed by PCPs.

   DESIGN: Cluster-randomized matched cohort study with implementation evaluation.

   PARTICIPANTS: PCPs affiliated with Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH).

   INTERVENTIONS: Unsolicited endocrinology eConsultation.

   MAIN MEASURES: The primary clinical outcome was mean change in HbA1c at 6 months. Secondary process outcomes included referral completion rate, prescription rates of glucose-lowering medications, differences in rate of other management recommendations, change in all glucose-lowering medications, and number of face-to-face endocrinology visits.

   KEY RESULTS: 161 PCPs were randomly assigned to intervention (n=81) and control (n=80) arms. eConsultations were triggered on 130 patients from intervention arm PCPs. Intervention arm patients had a 0.89 (SD 1.45) decrease in HbA1c compared to 0.69 (SD 1.32) decrease in the control arm (p=0.28). There were significant differences in prescribing of glucose-lowering medications between arms. There was a 19.3% increase in patients prescribed GLP-1 RA or SGLT2i in the intervention arm compared to a 6.9% increase in control (p=0.003). There were also significant increases in prescription rates of metformin (3.1% vs -3.1%, p=0.03) and sulfonylureas (1.5% vs -6.9%, p=0.03). At 6-month follow-up, the intervention arm had 13 in-person endocrinology visits compared to 29 (p=0.012) in the control arm. PCPs were more likely to accept recommendations regarding adherence to or dose adjustment of current medications than initiation of new medications.

   CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of an unsolicited endocrinology eConsult system for patients with poorly controlled T2DM is feasible. Unsolicited eConsultation was associated with increased prescribing of glucose-lowering medications without significant difference in HbA1c.

Abstract
  Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common congenital kidney disorder, generally caused by mutations in the PKD1 and PKD2 genes, coding for polycystins 1 and 2. Its pathogenesis is accompanied by alterations of the cAMP, mTOR, MAPK/ERK, and JAK/STAT pathways. ADPKD is clinically characterized by the formation of many growing cysts with kidney enlargement and a progressive damage to the parenchyma, up to its complete loss of function, and the onset of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The current aim of ADPKD therapy is the inhibition of cyst development and retardation of chronic kidney disease progression. Several drugs have been recently included as potential therapies for ADPKD including metformin, the drug of choice for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, according to its potential inhibitory effects on cystogenesis. In this review, we summarize preclinical and clinical evidence endorsing or rejecting metformin administration in ADPKD evolution and pathological mechanisms. We explored the biology of APDKD and the role of metformin in slowing down cystogenesis searching PubMed and Clinical Trials to identify relevant data from the database inception to December 2020. From our research analysis, evidence for metformin as emerging cure for ADPKD mainly arise from preclinical studies. In fact, clinical studies are still scanty and stronger evidence is awaited. Its effects are likely mediated by inhibition of the ERK pathway and increase of AMPK levels, which are both linked to ADPKD pathogenesis. Copyright © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Abstract
  Acarbose and metformin have been recommended both as monotherapy and add-on therapy in type 2 diabetes mellitus. A novel fixed-dose combination (FDC) of acarbose and metformin has been developed to improve compliance and patient adherence to therapy. The current study investigated the bioequivalence (BE) between acarbose/metformin FDC (50 mg/500 mg) with corresponding loose combination of individual components under fasting conditions in healthy Chinese male and female subjects, using a randomized, 2-period, 2-way crossover study design. Pharmacodynamic parameters of serum glucose ratio between treatment day and baseline (ratio of maximum concentration [Cmax ], day 1/Cmax , day -1 and ratio of area under the concentration-time curve [AUC] from time 0 to 4 hours, day 1/AUC from time 0 to 4 hours, day -1) were used as the primary variables to evaluate BE of acarbose. Pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax , AUC from time 0 to the last data point greater than the lower limit of quantification, and AUC were used to evaluate BE of metformin. The results showed that the 90% confidence intervals of the ratios of all primary target variables including ratio of Cmax , day 1/Cmax , day -1 and ratio of AUC from time 0 to 4 hours, day 1/AUC from time 0 to 4 hours, day -1 for acarbose, and Cmax , AUC from time 0 to the last data point greater than the lower limit of quantification, and AUC for metformin all fell within the acceptance limits of 0.8 to 1.25. Thus, BE between 50-mg acarbose and 500-mg metformin as an FDC and loose combination was established. Furthermore, different kinds of exploratory pharmacodynamic parameters (based on either serum glucose or insulin) including several newly proposed parameters were also investigated for acarbose BE evaluation in this study, and inconsistent results were observed.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a common disorder of pregnancy with health risks for mother and child during pregnancy, delivery and further lifetime, possibly leading to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Current treatment is focused on reducing hyperglycaemia, by dietary and lifestyle intervention and, if glycaemic targets are not reached, insulin. Metformin is an oral blood glucose lowering drug and considered safe during pregnancy. It improves insulin sensitivity and has shown advantages, specifically regarding pregnancy-related outcomes and patient satisfaction, compared with insulin therapy. However, the role of metformin in addition to usual care is inconclusive and long-term outcome of metformin exposure in utero are lacking. The primary aim of this study is to investigate the early addition of metformin on pregnancy and long-term outcomes in GDM.

   METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The Pregnancy Outcomes: Effects of Metformin study is a multicentre, open-label, randomised, controlled trial. Participants include women with GDM, between 16 and 32 weeks of gestation, who are randomised to either usual care or metformin added to usual care, with insulin rescue in both groups. Metformin is given up to 1 year after delivery. The study consists of three phases (A-C): A-until 6 weeks after delivery; B-until 1 year after delivery; C-observational study until 20 years after delivery. During phase A, the primary outcome is a composite score consisting of: (1) pregnancy-related hypertension, (2) large for gestational age neonate, (3) preterm delivery, (4) instrumental delivery, (5) caesarean delivery, (6) birth trauma, (7) neonatal hypoglycaemia, (8) neonatal intensive care admission. During phase B and C the primary outcome is the incidence of T2DM and (weight) development in mother and child.

   ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study was approved by the Central Committee on Research Involving Human Subjects in the Netherlands. Results will be submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVES: Metabolic control during puberty is impaired in Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) patients due to increased insulin resistance. Metformin is one of the oral medications typically used in type 2 diabetes mellitus to reduce insulin resistance. We aimed to examine the effect of metformin on glycemic indices and insulin daily dosage in adolescents with T1DM.

   METHODS: The present clinical trial was carried out on 50 adolescents aged 10-20 years with T1DM referred to the Endocrinology Clinic of Mofid Children's Hospital in Tehran for nine months. The patients were randomly divided into two groups. In the first group, metformin was added to insulin therapy, while the second group continued routine insulin therapy combined with placebo. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), weight, BMI, insulin dosage, and blood pressure were measured at the beginning of the study and repeated every three months. Serum lipid profile, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and liver enzymes were also measured twice: At the beginning and end of the study (after nine months).

   RESULTS: The HbA1c level (p<0.001) and insulin dosage (p=0.04) were lower in the metformin group than in the placebo group after nine months. Daily insulin dosage variability was significantly lower in the metformin recipient group (p=0.041). Serum triglyceride, cholesterol, and creatinine were significantly lower in the metformin arm than in the placebo arm (p<0.05). However, metformin did not affect LDL, HDL, liver enzymes, and BUN.

   CONCLUSIONS: Adjunctive metformin therapy reduces insulin dosage by inhibiting insulin resistance and weight gain. It helps decrease daily insulin dosage variability, which may prevent hypoglycemia. Also, metformin reduces creatinine, preventing renal failure in the long term.

Abstract
  Aim: To assess the prescribing patterns and response to different classes of antihyperglycemic agents in novel clusters of type 2 diabetes (T2D) described in India. Materials and Methods: We attempted to replicate the earlier described clusters of T2D, in 32,867 individuals with new-onset T2D (within 2 years of diagnosis) registered between October 2013 and December 2020 at 15 diabetes clinics located across India, by means of k-means clustering utilizing 6 clinically relevant variables. Individuals who had follow-up glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) up to 2 years were included for the drug response analysis (n = 13,247). Results: Among the 32,867 participants included in the study, 20,779 (63.2%) were males. The average age at diagnosis was 45 years and mean HbA1c at baseline was 8.9%. The same four clusters described in India earlier were replicated. Forty percent of the study participants belonged to the mild age-related diabetes cluster, followed by insulin-resistant obese diabetes (27%), severe insulin-deficient diabetes (21%), and combined insulin-resistant and insulin-deficient diabetes (12%) clusters. The most frequently used antihyperglycemic agents were sulfonylureas, metformin, and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors apart from insulin. While there were significant differences in HbA1c reduction between drugs across clusters, these were largely driven by differences in the baseline (pretreatment) HbA1c. Conclusions: In this new cohort, we were able to reliably replicate the four subtypes of T2D earlier described in Asian Indians. Prescribing patterns show limited usage of newer antihyperglycemic agents across all clusters. Randomized clinical trials are required to establish differential drug responses between clusters.

Abstract
  AIM: To report the results of a 104-week extension to a 52-week study in which dapagliflozin plus saxagliptin (DAPA+SAXA) improved glycaemic control, liver fat and metabolic variables compared with glimepiride (GLIM) in participants with type 2 diabetes (T2D) receiving background metformin.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: This extension to a 52-week global, multicentre, parallel-group, active-controlled, double-blind study (NCT02419612) continued randomized participants (1:1) on DAPA+SAXA (10/5 mg) plus placebo, or GLIM (1-6 mg) plus placebo, once daily. Eligible participants were aged >=18 years, had T2D (glycated haemoglobin [HbA1c] 58.5-91.3 mmol/mol [7.5%-10.5%]), and a body mass index of 20.0 to 45.0 kg/m2 , and were receiving metformin (MET; >=1500 mg/d). Key outcomes were: requirement for treatment intensification, based on HbA1c >=53 mmol/mol (7%); achieving therapeutic glycaemic response; and changes in adipose tissue and liver fat on magnetic resonance imaging in a substudy.

   RESULTS: Overall, 382 participants entered and 338 completed the 104-week extension period (MRI substudy, n = 82). The need for treatment intensification during the 156-week period was lower for DAPA+SAXA+MET (37.0%) than GLIM+MET (55.6%; hazard ratio 0.52, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.39-0.68; P < 0.001). At week 156, 21.4% of DAPA+SAXA+MET versus 11.7% of GLIM+MET participants achieved therapeutic glycaemic response (HbA1c <53 mmol/mol; odds ratio 2.1, 95% CI 1.23-3.42; P = 0.006). DAPA+SAXA+MET led to greater adjusted mean reductions from baseline in liver fat and visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue volumes versus GLIM+MET at week 122 (least-squares mean difference from GLIM+MET -4.89%, -0.41 L and -0.44 L, respectively; nominal P values <= 0.008). Safety was consistent with that of the monocomponents.

   CONCLUSIONS: Overall, glycaemic control, metabolic benefits and efficacy were better maintained with DAPA+SAXA+MET than with GLIM+MET in T2D. Copyright © 2021 The Authors. Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) has been effective in assessing glycemic variability in diabetic patients. This study aims at assessing the effect of Teneligliptin using ambulatory glucose profile (AGP) indicators.

   METHODS: A prospective, multicentre, open label study enrolling 59 type 2 diabetes patients between 18 and 65 years age was done between November 2020-May 2021. Patients were administered Teneligliptin 20 mg once daily, in addition to Metformin. The study included pre-treatment and two post-treatment phases. The data on time in range (TIR) and other AGP indicators of glycemic variability were obtained on each patient in all the three study phases and analysed to understand the effect of Teneligliptin on glycemic variability. Safety evaluation was done based on vital and biochemical parameters.

   RESULTS: The percent TIR in post-treatment phase I was significantly higher than the pre-treatment phase (p < 0.0001), and was maintained till the end of phase II (p = 0.037). There was significant lowering of time above range (>=180 mg/dL) in the phase I (p = 0.003), which was maintained in phase II (p = 0.043), suggesting better control over hyperglycemic state. The reduction in mean glucose level in phase I and II was also significant compared to baseline (p = 0.003 and p = 0.023 respectively). The glucose variability percent and glucose management indicator also showed significant lowering in both the phases.

   CONCLUSIONS: Teneligliptin addition to patients uncontrolled on Metformin monotherapy significantly reduced glycemic variability, as well showed significant glycemic improvement. Since this study was a single arm study, a comparative study with other DPP-4 inhibitors is needed. Copyright © 2022 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Lifestyle modification and weight loss are cornerstones of type 2 diabetes management. However, carbohydrate restriction may have weight-independent beneficial effects on glycaemic control. This has been difficult to demonstrate because low-carbohydrate diets readily decrease body weight. We hypothesised that carbohydrate restriction enhances the beneficial metabolic effects of weight loss in type 2 diabetes.

   METHODS: This open-label, parallel RCT included adults with type 2 diabetes, HbA1c 48-97 mmol/mol (6.5-11%), BMI >25 kg/m2, eGFR >30 ml min-1 [1.73 m]-2 and glucose-lowering therapy restricted to metformin or dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors. Participants were randomised by a third party and assigned to 6 weeks of energy restriction (all foods were provided) aiming at ~6% weight loss with either a carbohydrate-reduced high-protein diet (CRHP, percentage of total energy intake [E%]: CH30/P30/F40) or a conventional diabetes diet (CD, E%: CH50/P17/F33). Fasting blood samples, continuous glucose monitoring and magnetic resonance spectroscopy were used to assess glycaemic control, lipid metabolism and intrahepatic fat. Change in HbA1c was the primary outcome; changes in circulating and intrahepatic triacylglycerol were secondary outcomes. Data were collected at Copenhagen University Hospital (Bispebjerg and Herlev).

   RESULTS: Seventy-two adults (CD 36, CRHP 36, all white, 38 male sex) with type 2 diabetes (mean duration 8 years, mean HbA1c 57 mmol/mol [7.4%]) and mean BMI of 33 kg/m2 were enrolled, of which 67 (CD 33, CRHP 34) completed the study. Body weight decreased by 5.8 kg (5.9%) in both groups after 6 weeks. Compared with the CD diet, the CRHP diet further reduced HbA1c (mean [95% CI] -1.9 [-3.5, -0.3] mmol/mol [-0.18 (-0.32, -0.03)%], p = 0.018) and diurnal mean glucose (mean [95% CI] -0.8 [-1.2, -0.4] mmol/l, p < 0.001), stabilised glucose excursions by reducing glucose CV (mean [95% CI] -4.1 [-5.9, -2.2]%, p < 0.001), and augmented the reductions in fasting triacylglycerol concentration (by mean [95% CI] -18 [-29, -6]%, p < 0.01) and liver fat content (by mean [95% CI] -26 [-45, 0]%, p = 0.051). However, pancreatic fat content was decreased to a lesser extent by the CRHP than the CD diet (mean [95% CI] 33 [7, 65]%, p = 0.010). Fasting glucose, insulin, HOMA2-IR and cholesterol concentrations (total, LDL and HDL) were reduced significantly and similarly by both diets.

   CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Moderate carbohydrate restriction for 6 weeks modestly improved glycaemic control, and decreased circulating and intrahepatic triacylglycerol levels beyond the effects of weight loss itself compared with a CD diet in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Concurrent differences in protein and fat intakes, and the quality of dietary macronutrients, may have contributed to these results and should be explored in future studies.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVES: To determine the safety and efficacy of canagliflozin in comparison to metformin in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients with insulin resistance (IR).

   METHODS: A single-centre, prospective, randomized open-label (ratio 1:1) noninferiority trial was conducted at the Department of Endocrinology, Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, between July 2019 and April 2021. Women aged 18 to 45 years with PCOS and IR were enrolled and randomly assigned to either 100 mg (n = 33) canagliflozin daily or 1500 to 2000 mg metformin daily (n = 35) for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was changes in homeostatic model assessment (HOMA)-IR after 12 weeks of treatment. The secondary outcomes included changes in anthropometric measurements, menstrual frequency, sex hormone levels, metabolic variables and body fat distribution.

   RESULTS: For lowering of HOMA-IR after 12 weeks of treatment, canagliflozin was found to be noninferior to metformin (least-squares mean difference -0.81% [95% confidence interval -2.13 to 0.51]). Both canagliflozin and metformin significantly improved menstrual pattern, reduced body weight and total fat mass, and decreased triglyceride levels. Compared with metformin, canagliflozin had significant advantages in reducing uric acid and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate levels. Pruritus vulvae (9.09%) and gastrointestinal reaction (55.55%) were the main adverse events in the metformin group and canagliflozin group, respectively.

   CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that canagliflozin was not inferior to metformin in PCOS patients with IR, which suggests that sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors should be considered as effective drugs in the treatment of PCOS patients with IR. Copyright © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Abstract
  AIM: To compare (in the LIRA-PRIME [NCT02730377], a randomized open-label trial), the efficacy of liraglutide in controlling glycaemia versus an oral antidiabetic drug (OAD) in patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes (T2D), despite metformin use in a primary care setting (n = 219 sites, n = 9 countries).

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adults (n = 1991) with T2D (HbA1c 7.5%-9.0%) receiving metformin were randomized 1:1 to liraglutide (<=1.8 mg/d) or one OAD, selected by the investigator, added to metformin, for up to 104 weeks. Primary endpoint: time to inadequate glycaemic control (HbA1c > 7.0%) at two scheduled consecutive visits after week 26. Outcomes were assessed for liraglutide versus a pooled OAD group, and (post hoc) liraglutide versus sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, and sulphonylureas individually.

   RESULTS: Among randomized patients (liraglutide, n = 996; OAD, n = 995), 47.6% were female, mean age was 57.4 years and mean HbA1c was 8.2%. Median time to inadequate glycaemic control was 44 weeks longer with liraglutide versus OAD (109 weeks [25% percentile, 38; 75% percentile, not available] vs. 65 weeks [25% percentile, 35; 75% percentile, 107], P < .0001). Changes in HbA1c and body weight at week 104 or at premature treatment discontinuation significantly favoured liraglutide over OAD. Hypoglycaemia rates were comparable between groups and few patients discontinued because of adverse events (liraglutide, 7.9% [n = 79]; OAD, 4.1% [n = 41]). Similar results were observed in the post hoc analysis for liraglutide versus individual OAD classes.

   CONCLUSIONS: Glycaemic control was better maintained with liraglutide versus OAD, supporting liraglutide use when intensifying therapy in primary care patients with T2D. Copyright © 2021 The Authors. Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

  AIMS: To assess the efficacy and safety of iGlarLixi (the titratable fixed-ratio combination of insulin glargine 100 U/mL [iGlar] plus lixisenatide [Lixi]), in adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D) with glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels >=8% (>=64 mmol/mol).

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: The LixiLan-O study (NCT02058147) compared iGlarLixi with iGlar or Lixi in adults with T2D inadequately controlled on metformin +/- a second oral antidiabetes drug (OAD). This exploratory analysis evaluated the LixiLan-O subgroup of participants with baseline HbA1c levels of >=8% (>=64 mmol/mol) who were receiving metformin plus a second OAD at screening.

   RESULTS: The mean diabetes duration was 10.0 years, and the mean duration of second OAD use was 4.5 years. iGlarLixi demonstrated greater mean reductions from baseline in HbA1c and 2-hour postprandial glucose (PPG) compared with iGlar or Lixi (HbA1c -1.9% vs. -1.6% or -1.0% [-20 vs. -17 or -10 mmol/mol; 2-hour PPG -7.2 vs. -4.6 or -5.5 mmol/L). Greater proportions of participants achieved HbA1c <7% (<53 mmol/mol) with iGlarLixi versus iGlar or Lixi (67% vs. 51% or 18%), and the composite endpoints of HbA1c <7% (<53 mmol/mol) with no body weight gain (36% vs. 19% or 16%), and HbA1c <7% (<53 mmol/mol) with no body weight gain and no documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia (plasma glucose <=3.9 mmol/L; 28% vs. 15% or 15%). The incidence rates of documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia were 29.0%, 27.9% and 12.1% for iGlarLixi, iGlar and Lixi, respectively.

   CONCLUSIONS: Adults with T2D and HbA1c >=64 mmol/mol (>=8%) despite two OADs at screening achieved better glycaemic control with iGlarLixi versus iGlar or Lixi, without increased risk of hypoglycaemia versus iGlar.

Abstract
  AIM: To determine the effect of the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor linagliptin on postprandial glomerular hyperfiltration compared with the sulphonylurea glimepiride in adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D).

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this predefined substudy within a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, intervention trial, overweight people with T2D without renal impairment were treated with once-daily linagliptin 5 mg (N = 10) or glimepiride 1 mg (N = 13) as an add-on to metformin for 8 weeks. After a standardized liquid protein-rich meal, the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and effective renal plasma flow were determined by inulin and para-aminohippuric acid clearance, respectively, based on timed urine sampling. Intrarenal haemodynamics were estimated using the Gomez equations. Glucoregulatory/vasoactive hormones, urinary pH and fractional excretions (FE) of sodium, potassium and urea were measured.

   RESULTS: Compared with glimepiride, linagliptin increased the postprandial filtration fraction (FF; mean difference 2.1%-point; P = .016) and estimated glomerular hydraulic pressure (mean difference 3.0 mmHg; P = .050), and tended to increase GFR (P = .08) and estimated efferent renal arteriolar resistance (RE ; P = .08) from baseline to week 8. No differences in FE were noted. Glimepiride reduced HbA1c more than linagliptin (mean difference -0.40%; P = .004), without between-group differences in time-averaged postprandial glucose levels. In the linagliptin group, change in FF correlated with change in mean arterial pressure (R = 0.807; P = .009) and time-averaged mean glucagon (R = 0.782; P = .008), but not with changes in glucose, insulin, intact glucagon-like peptide-1, renin or FENa . Change in glucagon was associated with change in RE (R = 0.830; P = .003).

   CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to our hypothesis, compared with glimepiride, linagliptin does not reduce postprandial hyperfiltration, yet appears to increase FF after meal ingestion by increasing blood pressure or RE .

Abstract
  BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is associated with inflammation and subsequent increase in cardiovascular risk. Because of its widespread presence and distribution, invasive diagnostic procedures (i.e., liver biopsy) are reserved for a limited number of subjects. With liver ultrasound, Fatty liver index (FLI) and fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) scores non-invasively assess liver steatosis and fibrosis. We aimed to evaluate the changes in inflammatory markers and FLI/FIB-4 scores in non-obese metformin-treated type 2 diabetes patients (T2DM) with NAFLD.

   METHODS: All subjects underwent abdominal ultrasound aiming for NAFLD stratification (grade 1 to 3 according to its severity). Metabolic parameters (morning glycaemia, HbA1C, lipids, liver function tests), serum inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, ferritin, and nitric oxide) and FLI/- FIB-4 were calculated.

   RESULTS: FLI score and ultrasound NAFLD grades were found to correlate (p<0.05). We observed a significant correlation between the levels of ferritin and C-reactive protein (CRP) (p<0.05), and the FLI (p<0.05). Body weight (BW) (p<0.05), waist circumference (WC) (p<0.05), the levels of HbA1c (p<0.05), transferrin (p<0.05), insulin (p<0.05), and FLI score (p<0.05) significantly differed between groups as defined by the severity of NAFLD.

   CONCLUSION: This pilot study suggests that the serum inflammatory markers at the average normal values point to the sufficiency of metformin-single therapy in inflammation control in non-obese T2DM patients with NAFLD.

Abstract
  Background: Is insulin initiation linked to increasing body mass index (BMI) in all patients with type-2-diabetes (T2D)? To determine distinct longitudinal patterns of BMI change over time. Materials and Methods: 5057 patients with T2D (55% males, median BMI [IQR]: 30.0 [26.9-33.3] kg/m2) aged >=40 years at diabetes diagnosis and with >=2 years of follow-up after insulin initiation irrespective of previous or concurrent use of metformin/dipeptidyl peptidase-4-inhibitor from the multicenter prospective diabetes registry DPV were studied. To identify subgroups following a similar pattern of BMI change after insulin initiation, longitudinal group-based trajectory modeling was applied. Multinomial logistic regression was then used to analyze covariates associated with group membership. Results: Three heterogeneous groups with either relevant BMI increase (delta-BMI: +4.0 kg/m2 after 2 years; 12% of patients); slight BMI increase (+0.4 kg/m2; 80%); or BMI decrease (-3.2 kg/m2; 8%) were identified. Patients with older age [OR (95% CI): 1.37 (1.11-1.69)] and obesity [2.05 (1.65-2.55)] before insulin start were more often in the BMI decreasing group, and less often in the BMI increasing class [0.80 (0.67-0.95); 0.82 (0.69-0.98)]. A worse HbA1c both at insulin start and during follow-up [1.90 (1.60-2.26); 1.17 (1.07-1.27)], a higher insulin dose [1.67 (1.33-2.10)], and severe hypoglycemic events [2.38 (1.60-3.53)] after insulin initiation were all linked with higher odds of belonging to the BMI increasing trajectory. Conclusions: Patient heterogeneity with respect to weight gain after initiation of insulin therapy in adult T2D was detected by an objective computer algorithm. Older people with obesity should not defer from insulin use due to fear of weight gain.

Abstract
  Background: to evaluate the effects of Vitamin D3 on glyco-metabolic control in type 2 diabetic patients with Vitamin D deficiency. Methods: one hundred and seventeen patients were randomized to placebo and 122 patients to Vitamin D3. We evaluated anthropometric parameters, glyco-metabolic control, and parathormone (PTH) value at baseline, after 3, and 6 months. Results: a significant reduction of fasting, and post-prandial glucose was recorded in Vitamin D3 group after 6 months. A significant HbA1c decrease was observed in Vitamin D3 (from 7.6% or 60 mmol/mol to 7.1% or 54 mmol) at 6 months compared to baseline, and to placebo (p < 0.05 for both). At the end of the study period, we noticed a change in the amount in doses of oral or subcutaneous hypoglycemic agents and insulin, respectively. The use of metformin, acarbose, and pioglitazone was significantly lower (p = 0.037, p = 0.048, and p = 0.042, respectively) than at the beginning of the study in the Vitamin D3 therapy group. The units of Lispro, Aspart, and Glargine insulin were lower in the Vitamin D3 group at the end of the study (p = 0.031, p = 0.037, and p = 0.035, respectively) than in the placebo group. Conclusions: in type 2 diabetic patients with Vitamin D deficiency, the restoration of value in the Vitamin D standard has led not only to an improvement in the glyco-metabolic compensation, but also to a reduced posology of some oral hypoglycemic agents and some types of insulin used.

Abstract
  AIMS: The cardioprotective effects of glucose-lowering medications in diabetic patients with heart failure (HF) are well known. Several large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have recently suggested that the cardioprotective effects of glucose-lowering medications extend to HF patients regardless of diabetic status. The aim of this study was to conduct a Bayesian network meta-analysis to evaluate the impact of various glucose-lowering medications on the outcomes of non-diabetic HF patients.

   METHODS AND RESULTS: Medline and Embase were searched for RCTs investigating the use of glucose-lowering medications in non-diabetic HF patients in August 2021. Studies were included in accordance with the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and data were extracted with a pre-defined datasheet. Primary outcomes include serum N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and maximal oxygen consumption (PVO2 ). A Bayesian network meta-analysis was performed to compare the effectiveness of different classes of glucose-lowering medications in improving HF outcomes. Risk-of-bias was assessed using Cochrane Risk-of-Bias tool 2.0 for randomized trials (ROB2). Seven RCTs involving 2897 patients were included. Sodium-glucose transporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) was the most favourable in lowering NT-proBNP, with the significant reduction in NT-proBNP when compared with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1-RA) [mean differences (MD): -229.59 pg/mL, 95%-credible intervals (95%-CrI): -238.31 to -220.91], metformin (MD: -237.15 pg/mL, 95%-CrI: -256.19 to -218.14), and placebo (MD: -228.00 pg/mL, 95%-CrI: -233.99 to -221.99). SGLT2i was more effective in improving LVEF for HF with reduced ejection fraction patients relative to GLP1-RA (MD: 8.09%, 95%-CrI: 6.30 to 9.88) and placebo (MD: 6.10%, 95%-CrI: 4.37 to 7.84). SGLT2i and GLP1-RA were more favourable to placebo in improving PVO2 , with significant increase of PVO2 at a MD of 1.60 mL/kg/min (95%-CrI: 0.63 to 2.57) and 0.86 mL/kg/min (95%-CrI: 0.66 to 1.06), respectively. All three drugs had comparable safety profiles when compared with placebo.

   CONCLUSIONS: This Bayesian network meta-analysis demonstrated that SGLT2i, when compared with GLP1-RA and metformin, was superior in improving LVEF in HF with reduced ejection fraction patients, as well as improving PVO2 and NT-proBNP in non-diabetic HF patients. Further large-scale prospective studies are needed to confirm these preliminary findings. Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

Abstract
  AIM: In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) a progressive thinning in the central retinal thickness (CRT) is mainly related to neuroretinal degeneration and occurs before the decline in visual acuity or capillary density. We investigated the change in CRT by optical coherence tomography (OCT) in T2DM patients after 12 weeks of treatment with dapagliflozin or glibenclamide.

   METHODS: Ninety-seven patients (57 +/- 7 years) with T2DM and clinical or subclinical atherosclerosis were randomized 1:1 to dapagliflozin (10 mg/day) or glibenclamide (5 mg/day) on top of metformin XR 1.5 g/day. OCT was obtained in all patients enrolled in the study, both at the time of randomization and at the end of the study.

   RESULTS: Baseline and post-treatment values of fasting glucose and glycated hemoglobin were equivalent in the two arms. There was no difference in change in diabetic retinopathy status after therapy. The center subfield thickness changed by +2(6)mum in the dapagliflozin group and by -1(7) mum in the glibenclamide group (P = 0.001).

   CONCLUSION: A short-term treatment with dapagliflozin may increase CRT as compared with equivalent glycemic control with glibenclamide. Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  AIMS: To compare the cardiovascular, renal and safety outcomes of second-line glucose-lowering agents used in the management of people with type 2 diabetes.

   METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE and CENTRAL were searched from inception to 13 July 2021 for randomised controlled trials comparing second-line glucose lowering therapies with placebo, standard care or one another. Primary outcomes included cardiovascular and renal outcomes. Secondary outcomes were non-cardiovascular adverse events. Risk ratios (RRs) and corresponding confidence intervals (CI) or credible intervals (CrI) were reported within pairwise and network meta-analysis. The quality of evidence was evaluated using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) criteria. Number needed to treat (NNT) and number needed (NNH) to harm were calculated at 5 years using incidence rates and RRs. PROSPERO (CRD42020168322).

   RESULTS: We included 38 trials from seven classes of glucose-lowering therapies. Both sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP1RA) showed moderate to high certainty in reducing risk of 3-point major adverse cardiovascular events, 3P-MACE (network estimates: SGLT2i [RR 0.90; 95% CrI 0.84-0.96; NNT, 59], GLP1RA [RR 0.88; 95% CrI 0.83-0.93; NNT, 50]), cardiovascular death, all-cause mortality, renal composite outcome and macroalbuminuria. SGLT2i also showed high certainty in reducing risk of hospitalization for heart failure (hHF), ESRD, acute kidney injury, doubling in serum creatinine and decline in eGFR. GLP1RA were associated with lower risk of stroke (high certainty) while glitazone use was associated with an increased risk of hHF (very low certainty). The risk of developing ESRD was lower with the use of sulphonylureas (low certainty). For adverse events, sulphonylureas and insulin were associated with increased hypoglycaemic events (very low to low certainty), while GLP1RA increased the risk of gastrointestinal side effects leading to treatment discontinuation (low certainty). DPP-4i increased risk of acute pancreatitis (low certainty). SGLT2i were associated with increased risk of genital infection, volume depletion (high certainty), amputation and ketoacidosis (moderate certainty). Risk of fracture was increased with the use of glitazones (moderate certainty).

   CONCLUSIONS: SGLT2i and GLP1RA were associated with lower risk for different cardiorenal end points, when used as an adjunct to metformin in people with type 2 diabetes. Additionally, SGLT2i demonstrated benefits in reducing risk for surrogate end points in kidney disease progression. Safety outcomes differ among the available pharmacotherapies.

Abstract
  CONTEXT AND AIM: Metformin has been used in pregnancy since the 1970s. It is cheap, widely available and is acceptable to women. Despite its increasing use, controversy remains surrounding its benefits and risks. Metformin effectively reduces hyperglycaemia for the mother during pregnancy and it reduces rates of macrosomia and neonatal hypoglycaemia. However, concern exists surrounding an increase in the rate of SGA births and obesity in childhood. We aim to review the evidence and expert opinion behind metformin in pregnancy through to the post-partum period.

   METHODS: We performed a literature review of relevant studies from online databases using a combination of keywords. We also searched the references of retrieved articles for pertinent studies.

   RESULTS: There is strong evidence that metformin is safe in early pregnancy with no risk of congenital malformations. If used throughout pregnancy, it is likely to lead to reduced maternal weight gain and reduced insulin dose in women with type 2 diabetes. In infants, metformin reduces hypoglycaemia and macrosomia but may increase the rate of infants born SGA. There is some evidence of an increased risk of obesity and altered fat distribution in offspring. Metformin appears well tolerated in pregnancy and is more acceptable to women than insulin therapy.

   CONCLUSION: Due to increasing rates of maternal obesity, GDM and type 2 diabetes, metformin use in pregnancy is increasing. Overall, it appears safe and effective but further research is needed to examine mechanisms linking metformin to obesity reported during childhood in some follow-up studies.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) affects 23.6% of Qatari women and is associated with maternal and perinatal morbidity and long-term risk of developing type 2 diabetes. A number of challenges exist with current interventions, including non-compliance with dietary advice, the reluctance of mothers to ingest metformin tablets or use insulin injections. These challenges highlight the importance of pursuing evidence-based prevention strategies. Myo-inositol is readily available as an US Food and Drug Administration-approved food supplement with emerging but limited evidence suggesting it may be beneficial in reducing the incidence of GDM. Further studies, such as this one, from different ethnic contexts and with differing risk factors, are urgently needed to assess myo-inositol effects on maternal and neonatal outcomes.

   METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study is a prospective, randomised, double-blinded, placebo controlled clinical trial to either myo-inositol supplementation or placebo. We plan to enrol 640 pregnant women attending antenatal care at Sidra Medicine, Doha, Qatar, 320 in each arm. All participants will complete at least 12 weeks of supplementation prior to undertaking the Oral Glucose Tolerance Test at 24-28 weeks. The daily use of the trial supplementation will continue until the end of pregnancy. All outcome measures will be collected from the electronic medical records.

   ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval for the study was obtained on 12 April 2021 from Sidra Medicine (IRB number 1538656). Results of the primary trial outcome and secondary endpoints will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: Obesity is a global health challenge, and pharmacologic options are emerging. Once daily subcutaneous administration of 3 mg liraglutide, a glucagon like peptide-1 analogue, has been shown to induce weight loss in clinical trials, but real-world effectiveness data are scarce.

   METHODS: It is a single-centre retrospective cohort study of patients who were prescribed liraglutide on top of lifestyle adaptations after multidisciplinary evaluation. In Belgium, liraglutide is only indicated for weight management if the BMI is >30 kg/m2 or >=27 kg/m2 with comorbidities such as dysglycaemia, dyslipidaemia, hypertension, or obstructive sleep apnoea. No indication is covered by the compulsory health care insurance. Liraglutide was started at 0.6 mg/day and uptitrated weekly until 3 mg/day or the maximum tolerated dose. Treatment status and body weight were evaluated at the 4-month routine visit.

   RESULTS: Between June 2016 and January 2020, liraglutide was prescribed to 115 patients (77% female), with a median age of 47 (IQR 37.7-54.0) years, a median body weight of 98.4 (IQR 90.0-112.2) kg, a BMI of 34.8 (IQR 32.2-37.4) kg/m2, and an HbA1c level of 5.6%. Five (4%) patients did not actually initiate treatment, 9 (8%) stopped treatment, and 8 (7%) were lost to follow-up. At the 4-month visit, the median body weight had decreased significantly by 9.2% to 90.8 (IQR 82.0-103.5) kg (p < 0.001). Patients using 3.0 mg/day (n = 60) had lost 8.0 (IQR 5.8-10.4) kg. The weight loss was similar (p = 0.9622) in patients that used a lower daily dose because of intolerance: 7.4 (IQR 6.2-9.6) kg for 1.2 mg (n = 3), 7.8 (IQR 4.1-7.8) kg for 1.8 mg (n = 16), and 9.0 (IQR 4.8-10.7) kg for 2.4 mg/day (n = 14). Weight loss was minimal if liraglutide treatment was not started or stopped prematurely (median 3.0 [IQR 0.3-4.8] kg, p < 0.001, vs. on treatment). Further analysis showed an additional weight reduction of 1.8 kg in the patients that had started metformin <3 months before the start of liraglutide (p < 0.001). The main reasons for liraglutide discontinuation were gastrointestinal complaints (n = 5/9) and drug cost (n = 2/9).

   CONCLUSION: In this selected group of patients, the majority complied with liraglutide treatment over the initial 4-month period and achieved a significant weight loss, irrespective of the maximally tolerated maintenance dose. Addition of metformin induced a small but significant additional weight loss. Copyright © 2021 The Author(s). Published by S. Karger AG, Basel.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Though many randomized control trials had examined the effectiveness and safety of taking insulin therapy with or without metformin, there are limited real-world data, especially among Chinese type 2 diabetes patients initiating basal insulin (BI) with uncontrolled hyperglycemia by oral agents. This study was designed to assess the effectiveness and safety of BI therapy combined with or without metformin in a real-world national cohort study.

   METHODS: Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who initiated BI treatment due to uncontrolled hyperglycemia (HbA1c>=7 %) by oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) were recruited in Chinese real-world settings between 2011 and 2013. A total of 12,358 patients initiated BI without bolus insulin and completed a 6-month follow-up were selected as the study population and divided into BI with metformin or BI without metformin group based on whether metformin was simultaneously prescribed or not at baseline. Propensity score adjustment was used to balance baseline covariates between two groups. A sub-analysis was also conducted among 8,086 patients who kept baseline treatment regimen during the follow-up. Outcomes were HbA1c, hypoglycemia, weight gain and insulin dose in two groups.

   RESULTS: 53.6 % (6,621 out of 12,358) patients initiated BI therapy concomitant with metformin. After propensity score adjustment, multivariate regression analysis controlled with number of OADs, total insulin dose, physical activity and diet consumption showed that BI with metformin group had a slightly higher control rate of HbA1c <7.0 % (39.9 % vs. 36.4 %, P = 0.0011) at 6-month follow-up, and lower dose increment from baseline to 6-month (0.0064 vs. 0.0068 U/day/kg, P = 0.0035). The sub-analysis with patients remained at same BI therapy further showed that BI with metformin group had higher HbA1c control rate (47.9 % vs. 41.9 %, P = 0.0001), less weight gain (-0.12 vs. 0.15 kg P = 0.0013), and lower dose increment during 6-month follow-up (0.0033 vs. 0.0037 U/day/kg, P = 0.0073) when compared with BI without metformin group.

   CONCLUSIONS: In alliance with current guidelines, the real-world findings also support the insulin initiation together with metformin. Continuous patients' education and clinicians training are needed to improve the use of metformin when initiating BI treatment. Copyright © 2022. The Author(s).

Abstract
  Globally, the proportion of new diagnoses of youth-onset diabetes represented by type 2 diabetes is increasing, and youth with type 2 diabetes commonly have complications and comorbidities, as well as a higher rate of mortality. In this review, we summarise what is known about the natural progression of youth-onset type 2 diabetes from published clinical trials and large-scale prospective epidemiological studies. It is important to note that the robust pathophysiological and treatment data specifically related to individuals with a diabetes onset at <=20 years of age largely hails from the USA. Youth-onset type 2 diabetes is characterised by pathophysiological heterogeneity and inadequate glycaemic control, highlighting the need for new treatment approaches and innovative study designs in populations of varied genetic and cultural backgrounds.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Prospective comparative studies on the effects of various antidiabetic agents on bone metabolism are limited. This study aimed to assess changes in bone mass and biochemical bone markers in postmenopausal patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

   METHODS: This prospective, multicenter, open-label, comparative trial included 264 patients with T2DM. Patients who had received a metformin, or sulfonylurea/metformin combination (Group 1); a thiazolidinedione combination (Group 2); a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (gemigliptin) combination (Group 3); or an sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (empagliflozin) combination (Group 4) were prospectively treated for 12 months; bone mineral density (BMD) and bone turnover marker (BTM) changes were evaluated.

   RESULTS: The femoral neck BMD percentage changes were -0.79%+/-2.86% (Group 1), -2.50%+/-3.08% (Group 2), -1.05%+/-2.74% (Group 3), and -1.24%+/-2.91% (Group 4) (P<0.05). The total hip BMD percentage changes were -0.57%+/-1.79% (Group 1), -1.74%+/-1.48% (Group 2), -0.75%+/-1.87% (Group 3), and -1.27%+/-1.72% (Group 4) (P<0.05). Mean serum BTM (C-terminal type 1 collagen telopeptide and procollagen type 1 amino-terminal propeptide) levels measured during the study period did not change over time or differ between groups.

   CONCLUSION: Significant bone loss in the femoral neck and total hip was associated with thiazolidinedione combination regimens. However, bone loss was not significantly associated with combination regimens including gemigliptin or empagliflozin. Caution should be exercised during treatment with antidiabetic medications that adversely affect the bone in patients with diabetes at a high risk of bone loss.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: No meta-analysis has holistically analysed and summarised the efficacy and safety of gemigliptin in type 2 diabetes. The meta-analysis addresses this knowledge gap.

   METHODS: Electronic databases were searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving diabetes patients receiving gemigliptin in the intervention arm and placebo/active comparator in the control arm. The primary outcome was change in haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). The secondary outcomes were alterations in glucose, glycaemic targets, lipids, insulin resistance, and adverse events.

   RESULTS: Data from 10 RCTs involving 1,792 patients were analysed. Four had an active control group (ACG), with metformin/dapagliflozin/sitagliptin/glimepiride as the active comparator; six had a passive control group (PCG), with placebo/rosuvastatin as controls. HbA1c reduction by gemigliptin at 24 weeks was comparable to ACG (mean difference [MD], 0.09%; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.06 to 0.23; P=0.24; I2=0%; moderate certainty of evidence [MCE]), but superior to PCG (MD, -0.91%; 95% CI, -1.18 to -0.63); P<0.01; I2=89%; high certainty of evidence [HCE]). Gemigliptin was superior to PCG regarding achieving HbA1c <7% (12 weeks: odds ratio [OR], 5.91; 95% CI, 1.34 to 26.08; P=0.02; I2=74%; 24 weeks: OR, 4.48; 95% CI, 2.09 to 9.60; P<0.01; I2=69%; HCE). Gemigliptin was comparable to ACG regarding achieving HbA1c <7% after 24 weeks (OR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.52 to 1.63; P=0.77; I2=66%; MCE). Adverse events were similar between the gemigliptin and control groups (risk ratio [RR], 1.06; 95% CI, 0.82 to 1.36; P=0.66; I2=35%; HCE). The gemigliptin group did not have increased hypoglycaemia (RR, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.62 to 2.28; P=0.61; I2=19%; HCE).

   CONCLUSION: Gemigliptin has good glycaemic efficacy and is well-tolerated over 6 months of use.

Abstract
  AIMS: Evaluate whether structured BGM testing (BGM) or real-time CGM (CGM) lead to improved glucose control (A1c). Determine which approach optimized glucose control more effectively. METHODS-MULTI-ARM PARALLEL: trial of three type 2 diabetes (T2D) therapies +/- metformin: (1) sulfonylurea (SU), (2) incretin (DPP4 inhibitor or GLP-1 agonist), or (3) insulin. After a baseline CGM, 114 adult subjects were randomized to either BGM (4 times daily) or CGM (24/7) for 16 weeks with therapies adjusted every 4 weeks.

   RESULTS: A1c means decreased from 8.19 to 7.07 (1.12% difference) with CGM (n = 59) and 7.85 to 7.03 (0.82% difference) with BGM (n = 55) (p < 0.001). BGM and CGM groups showed significant improvements in time in range and glucose variability-with no significant difference between the two groups. Clinically important hypoglycemia (<50 mg/dL) was significantly reduced for the CGM group compared with BGM (p < 0.01), particularly in subjects taking insulin or therapies with higher hypoglycemic risk (SU).

   CONCLUSION: In T2D, structured, consistent use of glucose data regardless of device (structured BGM or CGM) leads to improvements in A1c control. CGM is more effective than BGM in minimizing hypoglycemia particularly for those using higher hypoglycemic risk therapies. Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety of sitagliptin in youth with type 2 diabetes (T2D) inadequately controlled with metformin +/- insulin.

   STUDY DESIGN: Data were pooled from two 54-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled studies of sitagliptin 100 mg daily or placebo added onto treatment of 10- to 17-year-old youth with T2D and inadequate glycemic control on metformin +/- insulin. Participants (N = 220 randomized and treated) had HbA1c 6.5%-10% (7.0%-10% if on insulin), were overweight/obese at screening or diagnosis and negative for pancreatic autoantibodies. The primary endpoint was change from baseline in HbA1c at Week 20.

   RESULTS: Treatment groups were well balanced at baseline (mean HbA1c = 8.0%, BMI = 30.9 kg/m2 , age = 14.4 years [44.5% <15], 65.9% female). The dose of background metformin was >1500 mg/day for 71.8% of participants; 15.0% of participants were on insulin therapy. At Week 20, LS mean changes from baseline (95% CI) in HbA1c for sitagliptin/metformin and placebo/metformin were -0.58% (-0.94, -0.22) and -0.09% (-0.43, 0.26), respectively; difference = -0.49% (-0.90, -0.09), p = 0.018; at Week 54 the LS mean (95% CI) changes were 0.35% (-0.48, 1.19) and 0.73% (-0.08, 1.54), respectively. No meaningful differences between the adverse event profiles of the treatment groups emerged through Week 54.

   CONCLUSIONS: These results do not suggest that addition of sitagliptin to metformin provides durable improvement in glycemic control in youth with T2D. In this study, sitagliptin was generally well tolerated with a safety profile similar to that reported in adults.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety of DPP-4 inhibition with sitagliptin in youth with type 2 diabetes (T2D).

   STUDY DESIGN: This was a 54-week, double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of DPP-4 inhibition with sitagliptin 100 mg once daily as initial oral therapy in youth with T2D. The 190 participants, aged 10-17 years, had HbA1c 6.5%-10% (7.0%-10% if on insulin). All were negative for pancreatic autoantibodies and overweight/obese at screening or diagnosis. The trial was placebo controlled for the first 20 weeks, after which metformin replaced placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline in HbA1c at Week 20.

   RESULTS: Treatment groups were well balanced at baseline (mean +/- SD HbA1c = 7.5% +/- 1.0, BMI percentile = 97.1% +/- 6.8, age = 14.0 years +/- 2.0 [57.4% <15], 60.5% female). At Week 20, least squares mean changes from baseline in HbA1c were -0.01% (sitagliptin) and 0.18% (placebo); between-group difference (95% CI) = -0.19% (-0.68, 0.30), p = 0.448. At Week 54, the changes in HbA1c were 0.45% (sitagliptin) and -0.11 (placebo/metformin). There were no notable between-group differences in the adverse event profiles through Week 54.

   CONCLUSIONS: DPP-4 inhibition with sitagliptin did not provide significant improvement in glycemic control. In this study, sitagliptin was generally well tolerated with a safety profile similar to that reported in adults. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01485614; EudraCT: 2011-002528-42).

Abstract
  AIMS/INTRODUCTION: Metformin is associated with the risk of gastrointestinal complications, and probiotic Bifidobacterium bifidum G9-1 (BBG9-1) can improve the symptoms of diarrhea. This study aimed to clarify the effects of probiotic BBG9-1 on the gastrointestinal symptoms of type 2 diabetes mellitus patients using metformin.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this open-label single-arm exploratory study, 40 patients (mean age 64.0 +/- 9.4 years) were given probiotic BBG9-1 for 10 weeks. Changes in the gastrointestinal symptom rating scale total score, which was the primary end-point, gastrointestinal symptom rating scale subscale scores, glycated hemoglobin levels and gut microbiota after the administration of probiotic BBG9-1 were evaluated by the Student's t-test.

   RESULTS: The gastrointestinal symptom rating scale total score significantly improved (from 2.02 +/- 0.51 to 1.59 +/- 0.43, change, -0.43 +/- 0.49, P < 0.001). Furthermore, all gastrointestinal symptom rating scale subscale scores, including diarrhea (from 2.32 +/- 1.14 to 1.89 +/- 0.99, change, -0.42 +/- 0.95, P = 0.007) and constipation (from 3.00 +/- 1.16 to 2.20 +/- 1.07, change, -0.80 +/- 1.19, P < 0.001), scores also significantly improved. However, the glycated hemoglobin levels did not change (from 7.0 +/- 0.7 to 7.0 +/- 0.6%, change, 0.0 +/- 0.4, P = 0.91). The relative abundance of the genus Sutterella decreased by the use of probiotic BBG9-1 (from 0.011 +/- 0.009 to 0.008 +/- 0.006, change, -0.003 +/- 0.006, P = 0.002).

   CONCLUSIONS: Type 2 diabetes mellitus patients treated with metformin showed significant improvement in all gastrointestinal symptom rating scores after using probiotic BBG9-1 without changing the glucose control. This study showed the potential usefulness of probiotic BBG9-1 for improving gastrointestinal symptoms, including constipation and diarrhea, in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients treated with metformin.

Abstract
  We assessed the glycaemic durability with early combination (EC; vildagliptin+metformin [MET], n=22) versus MET monotherapy (n=17), among newly-diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) enrolled (between 2012 and 2014) in the VERIFY study from Korea (n=39). Primary endpoint was time to initial treatment failure (TF) (glycosylated hemoglobin [HbA1c] >=7.0% at two consecutive scheduled visits after randomization [end of period 1]). Time to second TF was assessed when both groups were receiving and failing on the combination (end of period 2). With EC the risk of initial TF significantly reduced by 78% compared to MET (n=3 [15%] vs. n=10 [58.7%], P=0.0228). No secondary TF occurred in EC group versus five patients (29.4%) in MET. Patients receiving EC treatment achieved consistently lower HbA1c levels. Both treatment approaches were well tolerated with no hypoglycaemic events. In Korean patients with newly diagnosed T2DM, EC treatment significantly and consistently improved the long-term glycaemic durability as compared with MET.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: Although metformin is recommended as a first-line treatment for patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) in Western countries, no specific treatment is recommended in Japan, and various agents are used. Metformin has long been used at low doses in Japan, and information regarding its effect at the maximum maintenance dose is lacking. Here, we compared the efficacy and safety of metformin at 1500 mg/day with those of the other oral anti-diabetic drugs (OADs) approved in Japan.

   METHODS: Randomized controlled trials comparing a change in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) from baseline at 12 weeks or later (DELTAHbA1c) among OADs (including placebo) as a first-line treatment in adult patients with T2D were selected by systematic review with comprehensive searching of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Ichushi Web, and EMBASE and manual searching of clinical trial registries. The DELTAHbA1c and incidence of hypoglycemia were compared among OAD treatments using Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA). The relative risk (RR) of the incidence of hypoglycemia was determined relative to that of placebo.

   RESULTS: Forty-six randomized controlled trials were identified in the systematic review, and 37 studies, comprising 38 different types of treatments, including placebos, were selected for the NMA of DELTAHbA1c. Compared with metformin 1500 mg/day, 20 OAD treatments were significantly less effective in reducing HbA1c from baseline (differences from metformin 1500 mg/day: 0.40-0.96%). Two treatments (glimepiride 2 mg/day and pioglitazone 45 mg/day) showed greater mean reductions in HbA1c from baseline than metformin 1500 mg/day (- 0.38% and - 0.03%), although these differences were not significant. Regarding the incidence of hypoglycemia, only pioglitazone 30 mg/day among 31 treatments showed a lower RR (< - 0.01), whereas 23 treatments showed a significantly higher RR (1.02-66.71) than metformin 1500 mg/day.

   CONCLUSION: The NMA suggested a preferable efficacy and safety profile of metformin 1500 mg/day compared with the other OADs approved in Japan. Copyright © 2021. The Author(s).

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate remission of type 2 diabetes following a short-term intervention with insulin glargine, sitagliptin/metformin, and lifestyle approaches.

   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this open multicenter trial, 102 patients with type 2 diabetes were randomized to 1) a 12-week intervention with sitagliptin/metformin, insulin glargine, and lifestyle therapy or 2) control group. Participants with HbA1c <7.3% (<56 mmol/mol) at 12 weeks were asked to stop diabetes medications and were followed for evidence of relapse over 52 weeks. Diabetes relapse criteria included HbA1c >=6.5% (>=48 mmol/mol), >=50% of capillary glucose readings >10 mmol/L over 1 week, and reinitiation of diabetes medications with or without abnormal fasting plasma glucose (FPG) or 2-h plasma glucose on an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Time-to-relapse analysis was conducted to compare the treatment groups with (primary analysis) and without (supplementary analysis) FPG/OGTT relapse criteria.

   RESULTS: With the FPG/OGTT relapse criteria included, the hazard ratio (HR) of relapse was 0.72 (95% CI 0.47-1.10) in the intervention group compared with the control group (primary analysis), and the number of participants remaining in remission was not significantly different between treatment groups at 24, 36, 48, and 64 weeks. In the supplementary analyses without these criteria, HR of relapse was 0.60 (95% CI 0.39-0.95), and the number of participants remaining in remission was significantly higher (26 vs. 10%) in the intervention group at 36 weeks.

   CONCLUSIONS: Although our primary outcome was not statistically significant, the tested approach deserves further study with further optimization of its components. Copyright © 2021 by the American Diabetes Association.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: To evaluate the effects of teneligliptin on glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)-derived time in range, and glycemic variability in elderly type 2 diabetes mellitus patients.

   METHODS: This randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study was conducted in eight centers in Korea (clinical trial registration number: NCT03508323). Sixty-five participants aged >=65 years, who were treatment-naive or had been treated with stable doses of metformin, were randomized at a 1:1 ratio to receive 20 mg of teneligliptin (n=35) or placebo (n=30) for 12 weeks. The main endpoints were the changes in HbA1c levels from baseline to week 12, CGM metrics-derived time in range, and glycemic variability.

   RESULTS: After 12 weeks, a significant reduction (by 0.84%) in HbA1c levels was observed in the teneligliptin group compared to that in the placebo group (by 0.08%), with a between-group least squares mean difference of -0.76% (95% confidence interval [CI], -1.08 to -0.44). The coefficient of variation, standard deviation, and mean amplitude of glycemic excursion significantly decreased in participants treated with teneligliptin as compared to those in the placebo group. Teneligliptin treatment significantly decreased the time spent above 180 or 250 mg/dL, respectively, without increasing the time spent below 70 mg/dL. The mean percentage of time for which glucose levels remained in the 70 to 180 mg/dL time in range (TIR70-180) at week 12 was 82.0%+/-16.0% in the teneligliptin group, and placebo-adjusted change in TIR70-180 from baseline was 13.3% (95% CI, 6.0 to 20.6).

   CONCLUSION: Teneligliptin effectively reduced HbA1c levels, time spent above the target range, and glycemic variability, without increasing hypoglycemia in our study population.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To determine whether metformin or lifestyle modification can lower rates of all-cause and cause-specific mortality in the Diabetes Prevention Program and Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study.

   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: From 1996 to 1999, 3,234 adults at high risk for type 2 diabetes were randomized to an intensive lifestyle intervention, masked metformin, or placebo. Placebo and lifestyle interventions stopped in 2001, and a modified lifestyle program was offered to everyone, but unmasked study metformin continued in those originally randomized. Causes of deaths through 31 December 2018 were adjudicated by blinded reviews. All-cause and cause-specific mortality hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated from Cox proportional hazards regression models and Fine-Gray models, respectively.

   RESULTS: Over a median of 21 years (interquartile range 20-21), 453 participants died. Cancer was the leading cause of death (n = 170), followed by cardiovascular disease (n = 131). Compared with placebo, metformin did not influence mortality from all causes (HR 0.99 [95% CI 0.79, 1.25]), cancer (HR 1.04 [95% CI 0.72, 1.52]), or cardiovascular disease (HR 1.08 [95% CI 0.70, 1.66]). Similarly, lifestyle modification did not impact all-cause (HR 1.02 [95% CI 0.81, 1.28]), cancer (HR 1.07 [95% CI 0.74, 1.55]), or cardiovascular disease (HR 1.18 [95% CI 0.77, 1.81]) mortality. Analyses adjusted for diabetes status and duration, BMI, cumulative glycemic exposure, and cardiovascular risks yielded results similar to those for all-cause mortality.

   CONCLUSIONS: Cancer was the leading cause of mortality among adults at high risk for type 2 diabetes. Although metformin and lifestyle modification prevented diabetes, neither strategy reduced all-cause, cancer, or cardiovascular mortality rates. Copyright © 2021 by the American Diabetes Association.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND/AIM: Recent evidence suggests potential synergistic antitumor effects of the combination of programmed death-1 (PD-1)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) immune checkpoint inhibitors with the oral hypoglycemic agent metformin. The aim of this study was to investigate the safety and activity of metformin combined with nivolumab in diabetic cancer patients.

   PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with advanced melanoma, renal cell carcinoma or lung cancer receiving nivolumab with concurrent diabetes treated with metformin were retrospectively collected. The primary endpoint was the safety of nivolumab plus metformin combination.

   RESULTS: We collected 40 patients with solid tumors who received metformin for concomitant diabetes and nivolumab as anticancer therapy in four Italian Hospitals. The concomitant use of nivolumab and metformin was well tolerated; adverse events (AEs) of any grade occurred in 75% of patients (mainly fatigue, pruritus, rash, and asthenia). Grade 3 AEs occurred only in 20% of cases; no grade 4 AEs were observed. A statistically significant correlation was found between higher doses of metformin (>1,000 mg daily) and longer progression-free survival (p=0.021), overall survival (p=0.037) and higher overall response rate.

   CONCLUSION: The combination of nivolumab and metformin was safe and might have an antitumor activity, supporting further investigations on the synergistic antitumor effect of this combination.

Abstract
  WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Pregnant women are increasingly being exposed to metformin for conditions including gestational diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Metformin has been found to exhibit maternal to foetal transfer, and the long-term influence is uncertain. We conducted a meta-analysis to compare the efficacy and safety of metformin alone or as add-on therapy to insulin and insulin in pregnancy with gestational diabetes mellitus or type 2 diabetes mellitus.

   METHODS: We performed a comprehensive literature search of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library and ClinicalTrials.gov for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared metformin to insulin in pregnancy. Risk ratios (RRs) and mean differences (MDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to synthesize the results. Two authors independently extracted the data, evaluated study quality and calculated pooled estimates.

   RESULTS: Twenty-one studies involving 4,545 patients were included in this meta-analysis. Compared with insulin, metformin significantly reduced the risks of maternal weight gain [MD -1.51 kg, 95%CI (-1.90 kg, -1.12 kg), P < 0.00001], gestational age at birth [MD -0.12 week, 95%CI (-0.21 week, -0.02 week), P = 0.02], gestational hypertension [RR 0.63, 95%CI (0.48, 0.82), P = 0.0006], maternal hypoglycaemia [RR 0.33, 95%CI (0.15, 0.73), P = 0.006], birthweight [MD -0.13 kg, 95%CI (-0.20 kg, -0.07 kg), P < 0.0001], neonatal hypoglycaemia [RR 0.56, 95%CI (0.49, 0.64), P < 0.00001], neonatal intensive care unit admission [RR 0.73, 95%CI (0.64, 0.83), P < 0.00001], birthweight >=4000 g [RR 0.70, 95%CI (0.59, 0.83), P < 0.0001], and large for gestational age [RR 0.83, 95%CI (0.72, 0.97), P = 0.02] and significantly increased the risk of small for gestational age [RR 1.43, 95%CI (1.08, 1.89), P = 0.01] in pregnancy.

   WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Metformin may have potential benefits for pregnant women and newborns in terms of maternal and foetal outcomes. More studies with long-term follow-up of offspring exposed to metformin in utero are needed to provide evidence for the future use of metformin in pregnancy. Copyright © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: Whether metformin reduces all-cause cardiovascular mortality and the incidence of cardiovascular events in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular diseases (CVD) remains inconclusive. Some randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies have shown that metformin is associated with an increased risk of mortality and cardiovascular events.

   METHODS: We conducted a pooling synthesis to assess the effects of metformin in all-cause cardiovascular mortality and incidence of cardiovascular events in patients with CVD. Studies published up to October 2021 in PubMed or Embase with a registration in PROSPERO (CRD42020189905) were collected. Both RCT and cohort studies were included. Hazard ratios (HR) with 95% CI were pooled across various trials using the random-effects model.

   RESULTS: This study enrolled 35 published studies (in 14 publications) for qualitative synthesis and identified 33 studies (published in 26 publications) for quantitative analysis. We analysed a total of 61,704 patients, among them 58,271 patients were used to calculate all-cause mortality while 12,814 patients were used to calculate cardiovascular mortality. Compared with non-metformin control, metformin usage is associated with a reduction in all-cause mortality (HR: 0.90; 95% CI 0.83, 0.98; p = 0.01), cardiovascular mortality (HR: 0.89; 95% CI 0.85, 0.94; p < 0.0001), incidence of coronary revascularisation (HR: 0.79; 95% CI 0.64, 0.98; p = 0.03), and heart failure (HR: 0.90; 95% CI 0.87, 0.94; p < 0.0001) in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular diseases.

   CONCLUSION: Metformin use is associated with a reduction in all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, incidence of coronary revascularisation, and heart failure in patients with CVD; however, metformin usage was not associated with reduction in the incidence of myocardial infarction, angina, or stroke.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Plasma growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15) biomarker levels increase in response to inflammation and tissue injury, and increased levels of GDF-15 are associated with increased risk of mortality in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, which improve outcome in HFrEF, have been shown to increase plasma GDF-15 in diabetic patients. We aimed to investigate the effect of empagliflozin on GDF-15 in HFrEF patients.

   METHODS: This Empire HF Biomarker substudy was from the multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Empire HF trial that included 190 patients from June 29, 2017, to September 10, 2019. Stable ambulatory HFrEF patients with ejection fraction of <= 40% were randomly assigned (1:1) to empagliflozin 10 mg once daily, or matching placebo for 12 weeks. Changes from baseline to 12 weeks in plasma levels of GDF-15, high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP), and high-sensitive troponin T (hsTNT) were assessed.

   RESULTS: A total of 187 patients who were included in this study, mean age was 64 +/- 11 years; 85% male, 12% with type 2 diabetes, mean ejection fraction 29 +/- 8, with no differences between the groups. Baseline median plasma GDF-15 was 1189 (918-1720) pg/mL with empagliflozin, and 1299 (952-1823) pg/mL for placebo. Empagliflozin increased plasma GDF-15 compared to placebo (adjusted between-groups treatment effect; ratio of change (1.09 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03-1.15]: p = 0.0040). The increase in plasma GDF15 was inversely associated with a decrease in left ventricular end-systolic (R = - 0.23, p = 0.031), and end-diastolic volume (R = - 0.29, p = 0.0066). There was no change in plasma hsCRP (1.09 [95%CI, 0.86-1.38]: p = 0.48) or plasma hsTNT (1.07 [95%CI, 0.97-1.19]: p = 0.18) compared to placebo. Patients with diabetes and treated with metformin demonstrated no increase in plasma GDF-15 with empagliflozin, p for interaction = 0.01.

   CONCLUSION: Empagliflozin increased plasma levels of GDF-15 in patients with HFrEF, with no concomitant increase in hsTNT nor hsCRP.

Abstract
  Patients with type 2 diabetes who have cardiovascular disease and are receiving empagliflozin have a lower rate of primary composite cardiovascular outcomes. In contrast, glimepiride increases cardiovascular hospitalization when combined with metformin. Here, we assessed the effects of empagliflozin and glimepiride on endothelial function using flow-mediated dilation (FMD). In this prospective, open-label, randomized, parallel-group study, 63 patients with type 2 diabetes received metformin and insulin glargine U100 for 12 weeks. This was followed by additional treatment with empagliflozin or glimepiride for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was the change in the FMD measurement (DELTAFMDs) at 24 weeks of additional treatment. Secondary outcomes comprised changes in metabolic markers and body composition. The empagliflozin group (n = 33) and glimepiride group (n = 30) showed no significant differences in DELTAFMDs (empagliflozin, -0.11 [95%CI: -1.02, 0.80]%; glimepiride, -0.34 [95%CI: -1.28, 0.60]%; P = 0.73). Additionally, changes in glycated hemoglobin were similar between the two groups. However, a significant difference in body weight change was observed (empagliflozin, -0.58 [95%CI: -1.60, 0.43] kg; glimepiride, 1.20 [95%CI: 0.15, 2.26] kg; P = 0.02). Moreover, a body composition analysis revealed that body fluid volume significantly decreased after empagliflozin treatment (baseline, 35.8 +/- 6.8 L; after 12 weeks, -0.33 +/- 0.72 L; P = 0.03). Hence, although empagliflozin did not improve endothelial function compared with glimepiride for patients with type 2 diabetes, it did decrease body fluid volumes. Thus, the coronary-protective effect of empagliflozin is not derived from endothelial function protection, but rather from heart failure risk reduction. Trial registration: This trial was registered on September 13, 2016; UMIN000024001.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) represent two major chronic diseases that affect a large percentage of the population and share common pathogenetic mechanisms, including oxidative stress and inflammation. Considering their common mechanistic aspects, and given the current lack of effective therapies for AD, accumulating research has focused on the therapeutic potential of antidiabetic drugs in the treatment or prevention of AD.

   AREAS COVERED: This review examines the latest preclinical and clinical evidence on the potential of antidiabetic drugs as candidates for AD treatment. Numerous approved drugs for T2DM, including insulin, metformin, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA), and sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), are in the spotlight and may constitute novel approaches for AD treatment.

   EXPERT OPINION: Among other pharmacologic agents, GLP-1 RA and SGLT2i have so far exhibited promising results as novel treatment approaches for AD, while current research has centered on deciphering their action on the central nervous system (CNS). Further investigation is crucial to reveal the most effective pharmacological agents and their optimal combinations, maximize their beneficial effects on neurons, and find ways to increase their distribution to the CNS.

  INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) represent two major chronic diseases that affect a large percentage of the population and share common pathogenetic mechanisms, including oxidative stress and inflammation. Considering their common mechanistic aspects, and given the current lack of effective therapies for AD, accumulating research has focused on the therapeutic potential of antidiabetic drugs in the treatment or prevention of AD.

   AREAS COVERED: This review examines the latest preclinical and clinical evidence on the potential of antidiabetic drugs as candidates for AD treatment. Numerous approved drugs for T2DM, including insulin, metformin, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA), and sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), are in the spotlight and may constitute novel approaches for AD treatment.

   EXPERT OPINION: Among other pharmacologic agents, GLP-1 RA and SGLT2i have so far exhibited promising results as novel treatment approaches for AD, while current research has centered on deciphering their action on the central nervous system (CNS). Further investigation is crucial to reveal the most effective pharmacological agents and their optimal combinations, maximize their beneficial effects on neurons, and find ways to increase their distribution to the CNS.

Abstract
  Type 2 diabetes (T2D) management is based on combined pharmacological and lifestyle intervention approaches. While their clinical benefits are well studied, less is known about their effects on the gut microbiota. We aimed to investigate if an intensive lifestyle intervention combined with conventional standard care leads to a different gut microbiota composition compared to standard care alone treatment in individuals with T2D, and if gut microbiota is associated with the clinical benefits of the treatments. Ninety-eight individuals with T2D were randomized to either an intensive lifestyle intervention combined with standard care group (N = 64), or standard care alone group (N = 34) for 12 months. All individuals received standardized, blinded, target-driven medical therapy, and individual counseling. The lifestyle intervention group moreover received intensified physical training and dietary plans. Clinical characteristics and fecal samples were collected at baseline, 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month follow-up. The gut microbiota was profiled with 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. There were no statistical differences in the change of gut microbiota composition between treatments after 12 months, except minor and transient differences at month 3. The shift in gut microbiota alpha diversity at all time windows did not correlate with the change in clinical characteristics, and the gut microbiota did not mediate the treatment effect on clinical characteristics. The clinical benefits of intensive lifestyle and/or pharmacological interventions in T2D are unlikely to be explained by, or causally related to, changes in the gut microbiota composition.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Treatment with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) leads to multiple metabolic changes, reduction in glucose levels and body weight are well established. In people with type 2 diabetes, GLP-1 RAs reduce the risk of cardiovascular (CV) disease and may also potentially represent a treatment for fatty liver disease. The mechanisms behind these effects are still not fully elucidated. The aim of the study was to investigate whether treatment with liraglutide is associated with favourable metabolic changes in cases of both CV disease and fatty liver disease.

   METHODS: In a prespecified post-hoc analysis of a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 62 individuals with type 2 diabetes (GLP-1 RA liraglutide or glimepiride, both in combination with metformin), we evaluated the changes in plasma molecular lipids and polar metabolites after 18 weeks of treatment. The lipids and polar metabolites were measured by using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOFMS).

   RESULTS: In total, 340 lipids and other metabolites were identified, covering 14 lipid classes, bile acids, free fatty acids, amino acids and other polar metabolites. We observed more significant changes in the metabolome following liraglutide treatment compared to with glimepiride, particularly as regards decreased levels of cholesterol esters hexocyl-ceramides, lysophosphatidylcholines, sphingolipids and phosphatidylcholines with alkyl ether structure. In the liraglutide-treated group, lipids were reduced by approximately 15% from baseline, compared to a 10% decrease in the glimepiride group. At the pathway level, the liraglutide treatment was associated with lipid, bile acid as well as glucose metabolism, while glimepiride treatment was associated with tryptophan metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, and glycerophospholipid metabolism.

   CONCLUSIONS: Compared with glimepiride, liraglutide treatment led to greater changes in the circulating metabolome, particularly regarding lipid metabolism involving sphingolipids, including ceramides. Our findings are hypothesis-generating and shed light on the underlying biological mechanisms of the CV benefits observed with GLP-1 RAs in outcome studies. Further studies investigating the role of GLP-1 RAs on ceramides and CV disease including fatty liver disease are warranted.

Abstract
  Importance: The effects of tirzepatide, a dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, as an addition to insulin glargine for treatment of type 2 diabetes have not been described.

   Objective: To assess the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide added to insulin glargine in patients with type 2 diabetes with inadequate glycemic control.

   Design, Setting, and Participants: Randomized phase 3 clinical trial conducted at 45 medical research centers and hospitals in 8 countries (enrollment from August 30, 2019, to March 20, 2020; follow-up completed January 13, 2021) in 475 adults with type 2 diabetes and inadequate glycemic control while treated with once-daily insulin glargine with or without metformin.

   Interventions: Patients were randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive once-weekly subcutaneous injections of 5-mg (n = 116), 10-mg (n = 119), or 15-mg (n = 120) tirzepatide or volume-matched placebo (n = 120) over 40 weeks. Tirzepatide was initiated at 2.5 mg/week and escalated by 2.5 mg every 4 weeks until the assigned dose was achieved.

   Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was mean change from baseline in glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) at week 40. The 5 key secondary end points included mean change in body weight and percentage of patients achieving prespecified HbA1c levels.

   Results: Among 475 randomized participants (211 [44%] women; mean [SD] age, 60.6 [9.9] years; mean [SD] HbA1c, 8.31% [0.85%]), 451 (94.9%) completed the trial. Treatment was prematurely discontinued by 10% of participants in the 5-mg tirzepatide group, 12% in the 10-mg tirzepatide group, 18% in the 15-mg tirzepatide group, and 3% in the placebo group. At week 40, mean HbA1c change from baseline was -2.40% with 10-mg tirzepatide and -2.34% with 15-mg tirzepatide vs -0.86% with placebo (10 mg: difference vs placebo, -1.53% [97.5% CI, -1.80% to -1.27%]; 15 mg: difference vs placebo, -1.47% [97.5% CI, -1.75% to -1.20%]; P < .001 for both). Mean HbA1c change from baseline was -2.11% with 5-mg tirzepatide (difference vs placebo, -1.24% [95% CI, -1.48% to -1.01%]; P < .001]). Mean body weight change from baseline was -5.4 kg with 5-mg tirzepatide, -7.5 kg with 10-mg tirzepatide, -8.8 kg with 15-mg tirzepatide and 1.6 kg with placebo (5 mg: difference, -7.1 kg [95% CI, -8.7 to -5.4]; 10 mg: difference, -9.1 kg [95% CI, -10.7 to -7.5]; 15 mg: difference, -10.5 kg [95% CI, -12.1 to -8.8]; P < .001 for all). Higher percentages of patients treated with tirzepatide vs those treated with placebo had HbA1c less than 7% (85%-90% vs 34%; P < .001 for all). The most common treatment-emergent adverse events in the tirzepatide groups vs placebo group were diarrhea (12%-21% vs 10%) and nausea (13%-18% vs 3%).

   Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with type 2 diabetes and inadequate glycemic control despite treatment with insulin glargine, the addition of subcutaneous tirzepatide, compared with placebo, to titrated insulin glargine resulted in statistically significant improvements in glycemic control after 40 weeks.

Abstract
  Aim: To explore the chronic effects of metformin on testosterone levels in men with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

   Methods: This is a secondary analysis of a real-world study evaluating the efficacy and safety of premixed insulin treatment in patients with T2DM via 3-month intermittent flash glucose monitoring. Male patients aged 18-60 who were using metformin during the 3-month study period were included as the metformin group. The control group included males without metformin therapy by propensity score matching analysis with age as a covariate. Testosterone levels were measured at baseline and after 3-month treatment.

   Results: After 3-month treatment, the control group had higher levels of total testosterone, free and bioavailable testosterone than those at baseline (P<0.05). Compared with the control group, the change of total (-0.82 +/- 0.59 vs. 0.99 +/- 0.59 nmol/L) and bioavailable (-0.13 +/- 0.16 vs. 0.36 +/- 0.16 nmol/L) testosterone levels in the metformin group significantly decreased (P=0.036 and 0.029, respectively). In Glycated Albumin (GA) improved subgroup, the TT, FT, and Bio-T levels in the control subgroup were higher than their baseline levels (P < 0.05). Compared with the metformin subgroup, TT level in the control subgroup also increased significantly (P=0.044). In GA unimproved subgroup, the change of TT level in the metformin subgroup was significantly lower than that in the control subgroup (P=0.040).

   Conclusion: In men with T2DM, 3-month metformin therapy can reduce testosterone levels, and counteract the testosterone elevation that accompanied with the improvement of blood glucose.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to synthesize the latest evidence on the effect of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-IV) inhibitor in patients with COVID-19.

   METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search from the PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Clinicaltrials.gov up until 15 July 2021. Studies that met the following criteria were included: prospective or retrospective observational studies or case series or randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reporting DPP-IV inhibitor use in patients with COVID-19 and mortality. The intervention group was patients receiving DPP-IV inhibitor. The control group was patients that did not receive DPP-IV inhibitor. The outcome was mortality reported as odds ratio (OR).

   RESULTS: There were 11 studies consisting of 5950 patients in this meta-analysis. DPP-IV inhibitor use was associated with reduced mortality (OR 0.75 [0.56, 0.99], p = 0.043, I2: 42.9, p = 0.064) compared to those that did not receive DPP-IV inhibitor. Sensitivity analysis using the fixed-effect model (OR 0.75 [0.63, 0.88], p < 0.001, I2: 42.9, p = 0.064) also showed mortality benefit. The association between DPP-IV inhibitor and mortality was not significantly affected by age (p = 0.540), sex (p = 0.054), hypertension (p = 0.320), location (continent; p = 0.532), and retrospective/prospective nature of the study (p = 0.840). However, the association was affected by metformin (OR 1.03 [95% CI 1.01, 1.06], p = 0.010) and ACEI/ARB use (OR 1.06 [95% CI 1.02, 1.10], p = 0.004).

   CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis showed that DPP-IV inhibitor was associated with reduced mortality in patients with COVID-19. Copyright © 2021. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract
  Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is one of the leading causes of heart failure in patients with diabetes mellitus, with limited effective treatments. The cardioprotective effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2(SGLT2) inhibitors have been supported by amounts of clinical trials, which largely fills the gap. However, the underlying mechanism still needs to be further explored, especially in terms of its protection against cardiac fibrosis, a crucial pathophysiological process during the development of DCM. Besides, endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) has been reported to play a pivotal role in fibroblast multiplication and cardiac fibrosis. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin (DAPA) on DCM especially for cardiac fibrosis and explore the underlying mechanism. In vivo, the model of type 2 diabetic rats was built with high-fat feeding and streptozotocin injection. Untreated diabetic rats showed cardiac dysfunction, increased myocardial fibrosis and EndMT, which was attenuated after treatment with DAPA and metformin. In vitro, HUVECs and primary cardiac fibroblasts were treated with DAPA and exposed to high glucose (HG). HG-induced EndMT in HUVECs and collagen secretion of fibroblasts were markedly inhibited by DAPA. Up-regulation of TGF-beta/Smad signalling and activity inhibition of AMPKalpha were also reversed by DAPA treatment. Then, AMPKalpha siRNA and compound C abrogated the anti-EndMT effects of DAPA in HUVECs. From above all, our study implied that DAPA can protect against DCM and myocardial fibrosis through suppressing fibroblast activation and EndMT via AMPKalpha-mediated inhibition of TGF-beta/Smad signalling.

Abstract
  Purpose: Available data on the effects of anti-diabetic drugs on fracture risk are contradictory. Therefore, our study aimed to analyze all available data on the effects of anti-diabetic drugs on fracture risk in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients.

   Methods: Embase, Medline, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Cochrane CENTRAL were searched for relevant trials. All data analyses were performed with STATA (12.0) and R language (3.6.0). Risk ratio (RR) with its 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated by combining data for the fracture effects of anti-diabetic drugs, including sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, meglitinides, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, thiazolidinediones, biguanides, insulin, and sulfonylureas.

   Results: One hundred seventeen eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with 221,364 participants were included in this study. Compared with placebo, trelagliptin (RR 3.51; 1.58-13.70) increased the risk of fracture, whereas albiglutide (RR 0.29; 0.04-0.93) and voglibose (RR 0.03; 0-0.11) decreased the risk of fracture. Other medications were comparable in terms of their effects on fracture risk, and no statistical significance was observed. In terms of fractures, voglibose (0.01%) may be the safest option, and trelagliptin (13.64%) may be the worst. Sensitivity analysis results were consistent with those of the main analysis. No statistically significant differences were observed in the regression coefficients of age (1.03; 0.32-2.1), follow-up duration (0.79; 0.27-1.64), and sex distribution (0.63; 0.15-1.56).

   Conclusions: We found varied results on the association between the use of anti-diabetic drugs and fracture risk. Specifically, trelagliptin raised the risk of fracture, whereas voglibose and albiglutide showed benefit with statistical difference. Other drugs were comparable in terms of their effects on fracture risk. Some drugs (omarigliptin, sitagliptin, vildagliptin, saxagliptin, empagliflozin, ertugliflozin, rosiglitazone, pioglitazone, and nateglinide) may increase the risk of fracture, while others (such as dulaglutide, exenatide, liraglutide, semaglutide, lixisenatide, linagliptin, alogliptin, canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, glipizide, gliclazide, glibenclamide, glimepiride, metformin, and insulin) may show benefits. The risk of fracture was independent of age, sex distribution, and the duration of exposure to anti-diabetic drugs. When developing individualized treatment strategies, the clinical efficacy of anti-diabetic drugs must be weighed against their benefits and risks brought about by individual differences of patients.

Abstract
  AIMS: Metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) is common in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and can progress to advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis. In this retrospective study, we explored the longitudinal changes in markers of hepatic steatosis and fibrosis during T2D treatment with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs).

   METHODS: We analysed observational data from six diabetes outpatient clinics. In the whole T2D population, we calculated the hepatic steatosis index (HSI), which we previously validated against liver ultrasonography, and the Fibrosis (Fib)-4 index. We then identified patients who initiated a GLP-1RA from 2010 to 2018 and for whom data were available to evaluate changes in both HSI and Fib-4 scores over 24 months.

   RESULTS: From 83,116 outpatients with T2D, 41,302 (49.7%) had complete data for calculating HSI and Fib-4. Most of these T2D patients (~70%) had MAFLD (defined as HSI>36), 9.7% of whom had advanced fibrosis based on Fib-4 thresholds. Patients with low compared to high risk of advanced fibrosis were 5-times more likely to be treated with GLP-1RA. In 535 patients who initiated a GLP-1RA, the prevalence of MAFLD based on HSI declined significantly at 6 and 24 months, but Fib-4 categories did not. HSI improved significantly only in patients receiving human-based but not exendin-based GLP-1RA, while patients concomitantly receiving metformin had less worsening in Fib-4 categories.

   CONCLUSIONS: MAFLD is very common among outpatients with T2D (~70%) and the estimated prevalence of advanced fibrosis was ~10%. Treatment with GLP-1RAs significantly improved MAFLD, but not MAFLD-associated advanced fibrosis.

Abstract
  Metformin is a major treatment for type 2 diabetes. This study was conducted to investigate the impact of gut microbiome dysbiosis on the pharmacokinetics and antihyperglycemic effects of metformin. Healthy adult males aged 19-45 years with no defecation abnormalities were recruited for this 4-period clinical study: baseline; post-metformin (i.e., multiple oral doses of 1000 mg metformin on days 1-4); post-vancomycin (i.e., multiple oral doses of 500 mg vancomycin on days 11-17 inducing gut microbiome changes); and post-metformin + vancomycin (i.e., multiple oral doses of 1000 mg metformin on days 16-19). In each period, serum glucose and insulin concentrations following an oral glucose tolerance test, fecal samples for gut microbiome composition, and safety data were obtained. Following metformin dosing, plasma and urine samples for pharmacokinetics were collected. Nine subjects completed the study. The pharmacokinetics of metformin remained unchanged, and the antihyperglycemic effect was significantly decreased after vancomycin administration (p value = 0.039), demonstrating the weak relationship between the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of metformin. Relative abundances of some genus were changed after vancomycin administration, and tended to correlate with the antihyperglycemic effects of metformin (p value = 0.062 for Erysipelatoclostridium; p value = 0.039 for Enterobacter; and p value = 0.086 for Faecalibacterium). Adverse events occurred in all subjects and were resolved without sequelae. In conclusion, a decrease in the antihyperglycemic effect of metformin was observed after concomitant administration with vancomycin, without changes in metformin pharmacokinetics. The antihyperglycemic effect was tended to correlate with the relative abundance of several genus, suggesting that the effect of metformin is partly attributable to the gut microbiome (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03809260).

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: Metformin is a first-line pharmacotherapy in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, a condition closely associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Although metformin promotes weight loss and improves insulin sensitivity, its effect on intrahepatic triglyceride (IHTG) remains unclear. We investigated the effect of metformin on IHTG, hepatic de novo lipogenesis (DNL), and fatty acid (FA) oxidation in vivo in humans.

   DESIGN AND METHODS: Metabolic investigations, using stable-isotope tracers, were performed in ten insulin-resistant, overweight/obese human participants with NAFLD who were treatment naive before and after 12 weeks of metformin treatment. The effect of metformin on markers of s.c. adipose tissue FA metabolism and function, along with the plasma metabolome, was investigated.

   RESULTS: Twelve weeks of treatment with metformin resulted in a significant reduction in body weight and improved insulin sensitivity, but IHTG content and FA oxidation remained unchanged. Metformin treatment was associated with a significant decrease in VLDL-triglyceride (TG) concentrations and a significant increase in the relative contribution of DNL-derived FAs to VLDL-TG. There were subtle and relatively few changes in s.c. adipose tissue FA metabolism and the plasma metabolome with metformin treatment.

   CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate the mechanisms of action of metformin whereby it improves insulin sensitivity and promotes weight loss, without improvement in IHTG; these observations are partly explained through increased hepatic DNL and a lack of change in FA oxidation.

Abstract
  The numerous beneficial health outcomes associated with the use of metformin to treat patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM), together with data from pre-clinical studies in animals including the nematode, C. elegans, and mice have prompted investigations into whether metformin has therapeutic utility as an anti-aging drug that may also extend lifespan. Indeed, clinical trials, including the MILES (Metformin In Longevity Study) and TAME (Targeting Aging with Metformin), have been designed to assess the potential benefits of metformin as an anti-aging drug. Preliminary analysis of results from MILES indicate that metformin may induce anti-aging transcriptional changes; however it remains controversial as to whether metformin is protective in those subjects free of disease. Furthermore, despite clinical use for over 60 years as an anti-diabetic drug, the cellular mechanisms by which metformin exerts either its actions remain unclear. In this review, we have critically evaluated the literature that has investigated the effects of metformin on aging, healthspan and lifespan in humans as well as other species. In preparing this review, particular attention has been placed on the strength and reproducibility of data and quality of the study protocols with respect to the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of metformin. We conclude that despite data in support of anti-aging benefits, the evidence that metformin increases lifespan remains controversial. However, via its ability to reduce early mortality associated with various diseases, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cognitive decline and cancer, metformin can improve healthspan thereby extending the period of life spent in good health. Based on the available evidence we conclude that the beneficial effects of metformin on aging and healthspan are primarily indirect via its effects on cellular metabolism and result from its anti-hyperglycemic action, enhancing insulin sensitivity, reduction of oxidative stress and protective effects on the endothelium and vascular function.

Abstract
  Objectives: This study investigated the clinical efficacy and safety of metformin hydrochloride sustained-release (SR) tablet (II) produced by Dulening and the original metformin hydrochloride tablet produced by Glucophage in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

   Methods: This randomized, open and parallel controlled clinical trial consecutively recruited a total of 886 patients with T2DM in 40 clinical centers between May 2016 and December 2018. These patients were randomly assigned to the Dulening group (n=446), in which patients were treated with Dulening metformin SR tablets, and the Glucophage group (n=440), in which patients were treated with Glucophage metformin tablets, for 16 weeks. The changes in the levels of glycated hemoglobin (HbAc1) and fasting blood glucose (FBG) as well as weight loss were compared between these two groups. Also, the overall incidence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and the incidence of ADR of the gastrointestinal system observed in patients of these two groups were also compared.

   Results: There were no significant differences in demographic and basal clinical characteristics between these two groups. The Dulening and Glucophage groups showed comparable levels of decrease in HbA1c levels, FBG and weight loss after 12-week treatment (all p>0.05). The Dulening group had a significantly lower overall incidence of ADRs as well as gastrointestinal ADR than the Glucophage group.

   Conclusions: Metformin SR tablets (II) and the original metformin tablets exhibit similar therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of T2DM, but metformin SR tablets (II) has the significantly lower incidence of ADRs than the original metformin tablets.

Abstract
  This study aimed to evaluate the influence of Jinlida granules on glycemic variability with or without metformin treatment in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. This study was a 16-week, double-blinded, randomized, controlled clinical trial. The enrolled patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes were randomly divided into four groups: control, Jinlida, metformin, and combination treatment groups. A retrospective continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system was used for subcutaneous interstitial glucose monitoring for 3 days consecutively. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), traditional Chinese medicine symptom score, and CGM parameters, including glucose coefficient of variation, standard deviation of blood glucose values, and time in range of glucose 3.9-10.0 mmol/L, were assessed pre-test and post-test. A total of 138 participants completed the entire procedure. Compared with the pre-test, fasting plasma glucose, 2 hour postprandial plasma glucose, HbA1c, and traditional Chinese medicine symptom score all decreased in the four groups at the end of the test, and the combination treatment group showed the most significant decrease. In terms of CGM parameters, time in range of the Jinlida and metformin groups improved after intervention compared with the baseline (Jinlida group: 78.68 +/- 26.15 versus 55.47 +/- 33.29; metformin group: 87.29 +/- 12.21 vs. 75.44 +/- 25.42; P < 0.01). Additionally, only the Jinlida group showed decreased glucose standard deviation after intervention (1.57 +/- 0.61 vs. 1.96 +/- 0.95; P < 0.01). Jinlida granules can improve glycemic control and glycemic variability in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. Clinical trial registration number: ChiCTR-IOR-16009296.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes causes cardio-renal complications and is treated with different combination therapies. The renal hemodynamics profile of such combination therapies has not been evaluated in detail.

   METHODS: Patients (N = 97) with type 2 diabetes were randomized to receive either empagliflozin and linagliptin (E+L group) or metformin and insulin glargine (M+I group) for 3 months. Renal hemodynamics were assessed with para-aminohippuric acid and inulin for renal plasma flow (RPF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Intraglomerular hemodynamics were calculated according the Gomez' model.

   RESULTS: Treatment with E+L reduced GFR (p = 0.003), but RPF remained unchanged (p = 0.536). In contrast, M+I not only reduced GFR (p = 0.001), but also resulted in a significant reduction of RPF (p < 0.001). Renal vascular resistance (RVR) decreased with E+L treatment (p = 0.001) but increased with M+I treatment (p = 0.001). The changes in RPF and RVR were different between the two groups (both padjust < 0.001). Analysis of intraglomerular hemodynamics revealed that E+L did not change resistance of afferent arteriole (RA) (p = 0.116), but diminished resistance of efferent arterioles (RE) (p = 0.001). In M+I group RA was increased (p = 0.006) and RE remained unchanged (p = 0.538). The effects on RA (padjust < 0.05) and on RE (padjust < 0.05) differed between the groups.

   CONCLUSIONS: In patients with type 2 diabetes and preserved renal function treatment with M+I resulted in reduction of renal perfusion and increase in vascular resistance, in contrast to treatment with E+I that preserved renal perfusion and reduced vascular resistance. Moreover, different underlying effects on the resistance vessels have been estimated according to the Gomez model, with M+I increasing RA and E+L predominantly decreasing RE, which is in contrast to the proposed sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor effects.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors reduce the risk of a deterioration in heart failure (HF) and mortality in patients with a broad range of cardiovascular risks. Recent guidelines recommend considering the use of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and HF, irrespective of their glycemic control status and background use of other glucose-lowering agents including metformin. However, only a small number of studies have investigated whether the effects of SGLT2 inhibitor in these patients differ by the concomitant use of other glucose-lowering agents.

   METHODS: This was a post-hoc analysis of the CANDLE trial (UMIN000017669), an investigator-initiated, multicenter, open-label, randomized, controlled trial. The primary aim of the analysis was to assess the effect of 24 weeks of treatment with canagliflozin, relative to glimepiride, on N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) concentration in patients with T2D and clinically stable chronic HF. In the present analysis, the effect of canagliflozin on NT-proBNP concentration was assessed in the patients according to their baseline use of other glucose-lowering agents.

   RESULTS: Almost all patients in the CANDLE trial presented as clinically stable (New York Heart Association class I to II), with about 70% of participants having HF with a preserved ejection fraction phenotype (defined as a left ventricular ejection fraction >= 50%) at baseline. Of the 233 patients randomized to either canagliflozin (100 mg daily) or glimepiride (starting dose 0.5 mg daily), 85 (36.5%) had not been taking any glucose-lowering agents at baseline (naive). Of the 148 patients who had been taking at least one glucose-lowering agent at baseline (non-naive), 44 (29.7%) and 127 (85.8%) had received metformin or a dipeptidyl dipeptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, respectively. The group ratio (canagliflozin vs. glimepiride) of proportional changes in the geometric means of NT-proBNP concentration was 0.95 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.76 to 1.18, p = 0.618) for the naive subgroup, 0.92 (95% CI 0.79 to1.07, p = 0.288) for the non-naive subgroup, 0.90 (95% CI 0.68 to 1.20, p = 0.473) for the metformin-user subgroup, and 0.91 (95% CI 0.77 to 1.08, p = 0.271) for the DPP-4 inhibitor-user subgroup. No heterogeneity in the effect of canagliflozin, relative to glimepiride, on NT-proBNP concentration was observed in the non-naive subgroups compared to that in the naive subgroup.

   CONCLUSION: The impact of canagliflozin treatment on NT-proBNP concentration appears to be independent of the background use of diabetes therapy in the patient population examined.

Abstract
  Previous studies demonstrate mixed evidence regarding the association between metformin and skin cancer risk. To synthesize prior evidence and evaluate the association between metformin and skin cancer risk in patients with diabetes/prediabetes, we conducted a meta-analysis. A systematic literature search was performed up to March 23, 2020 to identify randomized controlled trials (RCT) and observational studies of metformin that reported any event of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), basal cell carcinoma (BCC), and melanoma. In a meta-analysis of 6 trials involving 8,541 patients (Peto method), compared with controls, metformin was not significantly associated with decreased risk of melanoma [OR, 0.82; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.27-2.43], BCC (OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.36-1.57), SCC (OR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.06-15.60), total nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC; OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.38-1.24), or total skin cancer (OR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.42-1.20). This nonsignificant association pattern was consistent with the random-effects meta-analysis of 4 cohort studies with 354,746 patients (melanoma: RR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.62-1.33; NMSC: RR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.35-1.18; total skin cancer: RR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.59-1.16). In conclusion, meta-analyses of both RCT and cohort studies showed no statistically significant association between metformin and skin cancer risks, although suggestive evidence of modestly reduced risks of skin cancer among metformin users was observed. Further studies are needed. PREVENTION RELEVANCE: Meta-analyses of RCT and cohort studies showed no significant association between metformin and skin cancer, although suggestive evidence of modestly reduced skin cancer risks among metformin users was observed. These findings suggest metformin use should not influence current medical decision making for diabetes patients at risk of developing skin cancer.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Both exercise and metformin are used to control blood glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), while no previous studies have investigated the effect of resistance exercise combined with metformin versus aerobic exercise with metformin in T2DM patients.

   OBJECTIVES: This study was conducted to compare the effects of resistance exercise combined with metformin versus aerobic exercise with metformin in T2DM patients.

   METHODS: A total of fifty-seven T2DM patients with a mean age of 46.2+/-8.3 years were randomized to three study groups; each group included nineteen patients. The first group conducted a resistance exercise program (REP, 50-60% of 1RM, for 40-50 min) combined with metformin, the second group conducted an aerobic exercise program (AEP, 50-70% maxHR, for 40-50 min) combined with metformin, and the third group received only metformin without exercise intervention (Met group). The study program was conducted thrice weekly for consecutive twelve weeks. Fasting blood glucose (FBG), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) were evaluated before and after study intervention.

   RESULTS: Significant differences were reported after the 12-week intervention inter-groups in the outcome variables (p<0.05). FBG, HbA1c, HOMA-IR, and VO2max improved significantly in the REP group (p<0.001) and also in the AEP group (p=0.016, p=0.036, p=0.024, and p=0.019 respectively) while the Met group showed an only significant reduction in FBG (p=0.049), and non-significant changes in HbA1c, HOMA-IR, and VO2max (p>0.05). REP group achieved greater improvements than AEP group (FBG, p=0.034; HbA1c%, p=0.002; HOMA-IR, p<0.001; and VO2max, p=0.024).

   CONCLUSION: Both resistance and aerobic exercise programs combined with metformin are effective in controlling T2DM. Resistance exercise combined with metformin is more effective than aerobic exercise combined with metformin in the treatment of T2DM.

Abstract
  Metformin is widely used to treat diabetes, but induces changes in glucose uptake in both normal organs and tumors. Here, we review the effects of metformin on the uptake of 18F-fludeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) in tissues and tumors, and its influence on 18F-FDG positron emission tomographic imaging (18F-FDG PET), as well as the mechanisms involved. This is an important issue, because metformin has diverse effects on tissue uptake of 18F-FDG, and this can affect the quality and interpretation of PET images. Metformin increases glucose uptake in the gastrointestinal tract, cerebral white matter, and the kidney, while regions of the cerebrum associated with memory show decreased glucose uptake, and the myocardium shows no change. Hepatocellular carcinoma and breast cancer show increased glucose uptake after metformin administration, while thyroid cancer shows decreased uptake, and colon and pancreatic cancers show no change. A high-energy diet increases 18F-FDG uptake, but this effect is blocked by metformin. Withdrawal of metformin 48 h before PET image acquisition is widely recommended. However, based on our review of the literature, we propose that the differentiation of metformin discontinuation could be reasonable. But future clinical trials are still needed to support our viewpoint.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1-RAs) and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, administered without metformin on cardiovascular outcomes in type 2 diabetes patients.

   METHODS: A systematic review was performed according to Cochrane's methodological standards. We included randomized clinical trials (RCTs) on adult type 2 diabetes patients, assessing the efficacy of SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP1-RAs compared to other glucose-lowering drugs and/or RCTs that presented data of a subgroup of type 2 diabetes patients without metformin use at baseline. The main outcome was the reduction of the risk of any major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) reported individually or as a composite outcome.

   RESULTS: Five RCTs including 50,725 type 2 diabetes patients, of whom 10,013 had not received metformin, were included in this meta-analysis. Three of these studies assessed the efficacy of GLP1-RAs and two of SGLT2 inhibitors. In patients without metformin at baseline, GLP1-RAs in comparison with placebo reduced the risk of MACE significantly by 20% (HR: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.71-0.89). SGLT2 inhibitors also significantly reduced the risk of MACE by 32% (HR: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.57-0.81).

   CONCLUSIONS: SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP1-RAs provided without metformin at baseline may reduce the risk of MACE in comparison with placebo in type 2 diabetes patients at increased risk of cardiovascular events. Copyright © 2020 Diabetes UK.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: Ectopic lipid accumulation in the kidney (fatty kidney) is a potential driver of diabetic kidney disease, and tight glycemic control can reduce risk of diabetic nephropathy. We assessed whether glycemic control influences renal triglyceride content (RTGC). Furthermore, we compared glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist liraglutide versus standard glucose-lowering therapy.

   DESIGN AND METHODS: In this single-center parallel-group trial, patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were randomized to liraglutide or placebo added to standard care (metformin/sulfonylurea derivative/insulin). Changes in RTGC after 26 weeks of glycemic control measured by proton spectroscopy and difference in RTGC between treatment groups were analyzed.

   RESULTS: Fifty patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were included in the baseline analysis (mean age, 56.5 +/- 9.1 years; range, 33-73 years; 46% males). Seventeen patients had baseline and follow-up measurements. Mean glycated hemoglobin was 7.8 +/- 0.8%, which changed to 7.3 +/- 0.9% after 26 weeks of glycemic control irrespective of treatment group (P = .046). Log-transformed RTGC was -0.68 +/- 0.30% and changed to -0.83 +/- 0.32% after 26 weeks of glycemic control irrespective of treatment group (P = .049). A 26-week-to--baseline RTGC ratio (95% confidence interval) was significantly different between liraglutide (-0.30 [-0.50, -0.09]) and placebo added to standard care (-0.003 [-0.34, 0.34]) (P = .04).

   CONCLUSION: In this exploratory study, we found that 26 weeks of glycemic control resulted in lower RTGC, in particular for liraglutide; however, larger clinical studies are needed to assess whether these changes reflect a true effect of glycemic control on fatty kidney.

Abstract
  Metformin reduces insulin resistance, which constitutes a pathophysiological connection of diabetes with Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the evidence of metformin on AD development was still insufficient and conflicting. We investigated AD risk in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 DM treated with metformin. This retrospective, observational, nested case-control study included patients with newly diagnosed type 2 DM obtained from the Korean National Health Insurance Service DM cohort (2002-2017). Among 70,499 dementia-free DM patients, 1675 AD cases were matched to 8375 controls for age, sex, and DM onset and duration. The association between AD and metformin was analyzed by multivariable regression analyses, adjusted for comorbidities and cardiometabolic risk profile. Metformin use was associated with an increased odds of AD (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.50; 95% CI 1.23-1.83). The risk of AD was higher in patients with a longer DM duration. Furthermore, AD risk was significantly high in DM patients with depression (AOR 2.05; 95% CI 1.02-4.12). Given the large number of patients with DM who are taking metformin worldwide, a double-blinded, prospective study is required to determine the long-term cognitive safety of metformin.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Evidence from large randomized clinical trials supports the benefit of SGLT2i (sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors) to improve cardiovascular and kidney outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes with or at high risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or chronic kidney disease. Considering this evidence, which has been expanding since the product label indication for empagliflozin to reduce risk of cardiovascular death in 2016, clinician-level variation in the prescription of SGLT2i among US Medicare beneficiaries was evaluated.

   METHODS: Antihyperglycemic medication prescribers were identified as those physicians and advanced practice providers prescribing metformin in Medicare part D prescriber data. In this cross-sectional study, the proportion prescribing SGLT2i was assessed overall and across specialties in 2018, with changes assessed from 2014 to 2018. SGLT2i use was compared with other second-line antihyperglycemic medication classes, sulfonylureas and DPP4is (dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors).

   RESULTS: Among 232 523 unique clinicians who prescribed metformin for Medicare beneficiaries in 2018 (diabetes-treating clinicians), 45 255 (19.5%) prescribed SGLT2i. There was substantial variation across specialties-from 72% of endocrinologists to 14% of cardiologists who prescribed metformin also prescribed SGLT2i. Between 2014 and 2018, the number prescribing SGLT2i increased 5-fold from 9048 in 2014 to 45 255 in 2018. Among clinicians who prescribed both sulfonylureas and SGLT2i in 2018, SGLT2i was prescribed to a median 33 beneficiaries for every 100 prescribed sulfonylureas (interquartile range, 18-67). SGLT2i use relative to sulfonylureas increased from 19 (interquartile range, 11-34) per 100 in 2014 to 33 (interquartile range, 18-67) per 100 in 2018 (Ptrend<0.001).

   CONCLUSIONS: Eighty percent of clinicians prescribing metformin to Medicare beneficiaries did not prescribe SGLT2i in 2018. Moreover, sulfonylureas prescriptions were 3 times more frequent than those of SGLT2is, although a pattern of increasing uptake may portend future trends. These findings highlight a baseline opportunity to improve care and outcomes for patients with type 2 diabetes.

Abstract
  AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The aim of this parallel-group, double-blinded (study personnel and participants), randomised clinical trial was to assess the interaction between metformin and exercise training on postprandial glucose in glucose-intolerant individuals.

   METHODS: Glucose-intolerant (2 h OGTT glucose of 7.8-11.0 mmol/l and/or HbA1c of 39-47 mmol/mol [5.7-6.5%] or glucose-lowering-medication naive type 2 diabetes), overweight/obese (BMI 25-42 kg/m2) individuals were randomly allocated to a placebo study group (PLA, n = 15) or a metformin study group (MET, n = 14), and underwent 3 experimental days: BASELINE (before randomisation), MEDICATION (after 3 weeks of metformin [2 g/day] or placebo treatment) and TRAINING (after 12 weeks of exercise training in combination with metformin/placebo treatment). Training consisted of supervised bicycle interval sessions with a mean intensity of 64% of Wattmax for 45 min, 4 times/week. The primary outcome was postprandial glucose (mean glucose concentration) during a mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT), which was assessed on each experimental day. For within-group differences, a group x time interaction was assessed using two-way repeated measures ANOVA. Between-group changes of the outcomes at different timepoints were compared using unpaired two-tailed Student's t tests.

   RESULTS: Postprandial glucose improved from BASELINE to TRAINING in both the PLA group and the MET group (PLA: -0.7 [95% CI -1.4, 0.0] mmol/l, p = 0.05 and MET: -0.7 [-1.5, -0.0] mmol/l, p = 0.03), with no between-group difference (p = 0.92). In PLA, the entire reduction was seen from MEDICATION to TRAINING (-0.8 [-1.3, -0.1] mmol/l, p = 0.01). Conversely, in MET, the entire reduction was observed from BASELINE to MEDICATION (-0.9 [-1.6, -0.2] mmol/l, p = 0.01). The reductions in mean glucose concentration during the MMTT from BASELINE to TRAINING were dependent on differential time effects: in the PLA group, a decrease was observed at timepoint (t) = 120 min (p = 0.009), whereas in the MET group, a reduction occurred at t = 30 min (p < 0.001). VO2peak increased 15% (4.6 [3.3, 5.9] ml kg-1 min-1, p < 0.0001) from MEDICATION to TRAINING and body weight decreased (-4.0 [-5.2, -2.7] kg, p < 0.0001) from BASELINE to TRAINING, with no between-group differences (p = 0.7 and p = 0.5, respectively).

   CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Metformin plus exercise training was not superior to exercise training alone in improving postprandial glucose. The differential time effects during the MMTT suggest an interaction between the two modalities.

Abstract
  AIMS: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors vs placebo as add-on therapy after metformin and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor dual therapy in type 2 diabetes.

   METHODS: This systematic review was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines (PROSPERO registration number: CRD42018099398). A search was conducted via PubMed, www.clinicaltrials.gov and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials of relevant randomised controlled trials up until 14 August 2020 that compared sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors vs placebo as add-on therapy after metformin and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor therapy. A random-effects model was used.

   RESULTS: Six randomised controlled trials (1661 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Compared with placebo, sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor treatment, as add-on to metformin and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor therapy, was associated with a significant reduction in HbA1c level [mean difference -8 mmol/mol, 95% CI -10, -6 (-0.7%, 95% CI -0.9, -0.6); P < 0.00001], in fasting plasma glucose level [mean difference -1.70 mmol/l, 95% CI -1.91, -1.49; P < 0.00001], in weight (mean difference -1.76 kg, 95% CI -2.04, -1.48; P < 0.00001) and in blood pressure (systolic blood pressure: mean difference -3.6 mmHg, 95% CI -4.8, -2.4; P < 0.00001; diastolic blood pressure: mean difference -1.5 mmHg; 95% CI -2.4, -0.6; P = 0.002). Genital mycotic infections (odds ratio 7.37, 95% CI 3.06, 17.76; P < 0.00001) were more common with sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors, but there was no significant statistical difference in urinary tract infections (odds ratio 1.16, 95% CI 0.63, 2.13; P = 0.64), in hypoglycaemia (odds ratio 1.36, 95% CI 0.61, 3.04; P = 0.45), or in discontinuation rates due to adverse events (odds ratio 1.52, 95% CI 0.78, 2.97; P = 0.22) between the two groups.

   CONCLUSIONS: In comparison with placebo, add-on therapy with a sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor is significantly more efficacious in lowering HbA1c , fasting plasma glucose and weight in people with type 2 diabetes following inadequate glycaemic control with metformin and a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor. The rate of discontinuation due to adverse events was similar despite higher risk of genital mycotic infections. Copyright © 2020 Diabetes UK.

Abstract
  Introduction: In general, patients with type 2 diabetes have lower cardiorespiratory fitness levels and perform exercise at lower intensities compared to healthy controls. Since metformin (MET) has been shown to increase the rate of perceived exertion (RPE) during exercise with a fixed intensity, MET per se may reduce self-selected exercise intensity. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of MET on self-selected exercise intensity.

   Methods: Healthy males were eligible for this crossover, counterbalanced study with two treatment periods: MET and placebo (PLA), each lasting 17 days. Treatment dose was gradually increased and reached 2 g/day on treatment day 9, and continued at that level for the rest of the treatment period. The two periods were performed in randomized order. Two experimental days (A+B) were conducted on Day 15 (A) and Day 17 (B) of each period, respectively. Day A consisted of an exercise bout with self-selected exercise intensity (equal to RPE = 14-15 on the Borg Scale). Day B consisted of an exercise bout with fixed intensity (70% of VO2peak). Oxygen consumption rate was assessed continuously during both exercise bouts.

   Results: Fifteen males (age 23.7 +/- 0.6 years, BMI 22.3 +/- 2.0, VO2peak 3.5 +/- 0.6 L/min) were included in the study. On Day B, RPE was higher in MET compared to PLA (14.8 +/- 0.4 vs. 14.0 +/- 0.3, P = 0.045). On Day A, no difference in self-selected exercise intensity measured by oxygen consumption rate (PLA 2.33 +/- 0.09 L O2/min, MET 2.42 +/- 0.10 L O2/min, P = 0.09) was seen between treatment periods.

   Conclusions: Self-selected exercise intensity was not reduced by MET in healthy males, despite the fact that MET increased RPE during an exercise bout with fixed intensity. Copyright © 2021 Pilmark, Petersen-Bonding, Holm, Johansen, Pedersen, Hansen and Karstoft.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Hyperuricemia has a strong association with diabetes mellitus. Hyperuricemia can lead to cardiovascular and renal complications in patients with diabetes. The goal of this study was to compare the effect of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors dapagliflozin and empagliflozin on serum uric acid (SUA) levels in patients with type 2 diabetes against traditional oral antihyperglycemic drugs (OADs).

   METHODS: In this double-blind randomized controlled trial, 70 patients with type 2 diabetes and elevated SUA levels were assigned to two treatment groups. Patients in group A received SGLT-2 inhibitors tablet dapagliflozin 5 mg to 10 mg and empagliflozin 10 mg to 25 mg. Group B patients received OADs such as glimepiride, metformin, sitagliptin, gliclazide, and glibenclamide as monotherapy or combination therapy. The changes in SUA level were primary end points while changes in body weight and body mass index (BMI) from baseline to end point were secondary end points.

   RESULTS: After four weeks of treatment, we noted a significant reduction of mean SUA levels in the SGLT-2 inhibitor group from 7.5 +/- 2.5 to 6.3 +/- 0.8 mg/dl versus comparator group from 7.1 +/- 1.8 to 6.8 +/- 2.2 mg/dl (p = 0.001). Mean body weight was significantly reduced in the SGLT-2 group from 82 +/- 10.4 to 78 +/- 12.5 kg versus comparator group from 78 +/- 13.2 to 79.2 +/- 9.7 kg (p = 0.001). Similarly, the mean BMI of patients in the SGLT-2 group was significantly reduced from 25.7 +/- 3.2 to 24.2 +/- 3.2 kg/m2 versus comparator group from 27.5 +/- 4.2 to 28 +/- 3.6 kg/m2 (p = 0.002).

   CONCLUSION: SGLT-2 inhibitors have a strong potential to decrease SUA levels in patients with type 2 diabetes. Copyright © 2021 Mazhar Hussain et al.

Abstract
  PURPOSE: Pasireotide is an effective treatment for acromegaly and Cushing's disease, although treatment-emergent hyperglycemia can occur. The objective of this study was to assess incretin-based therapy versus insulin for managing pasireotide-associated hyperglycemia uncontrolled by metformin/other permitted oral antidiabetic drugs.

   METHODS: Multicenter, randomized, open-label, Phase IV study comprising a core phase (<= 16-week pre-randomization period followed by 16-week randomized treatment period) and optional extension (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT02060383). Adults with acromegaly (n = 190) or Cushing's disease (n = 59) received long-acting (starting 40 mg IM/28 days) or subcutaneous pasireotide (starting 600 microg bid), respectively. Patients with increased fasting plasma glucose (>= 126 mg/dL on three consecutive days) during the 16-week pre-randomization period despite metformin/other oral antidiabetic drugs were randomized 1:1 to open-label incretin-based therapy (sitagliptin followed by liraglutide) or insulin for another 16 weeks. The primary objective was to evaluate the difference in mean change in HbA1c from randomization to end of core phase between incretin-based therapy and insulin treatment arms.

   RESULTS: Eighty-one (32.5%) patients were randomized to incretin-based therapy (n = 38 received sitagliptin, n = 28 subsequently switched to liraglutide; n = 12 received insulin as rescue therapy) or insulin (n = 43). Adjusted mean change in HbA1c between treatment arms was - 0.28% (95% CI - 0.63, 0.08) in favor of incretin-based therapy. The most common AE other than hyperglycemia was diarrhea (incretin-based therapy, 28.9%; insulin, 30.2%). Forty-six (18.5%) patients were managed on metformin (n = 43)/other OAD (n = 3), 103 (41.4%) patients did not require any oral antidiabetic drugs and 19 patients (7.6%) were receiving insulin at baseline and were not randomized.

   CONCLUSION: Many patients receiving pasireotide do not develop hyperglycemia requiring oral antidiabetic drugs. Metformin is an effective initial treatment, followed by incretin-based therapy if needed. ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT02060383. Copyright © 2021. The Author(s).

Abstract
  AIMS: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a strong risk factor for complications of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The effect of T2DM medications on COVID-19 outcomes remains unclear. In a retrospective analysis of a cohort of 131 patients with T2DM hospitalized for COVID-19 in Wuhan, we have previously found that metformin use prior to hospitalization is associated with reduced mortality. The current study aims to investigate the effects of inpatient use of T2DM medications, including metformin, acarbose, insulin and sulfonylureas, on the mortality of COVID-19 patients with T2DM during hospitalization.

   METHODS: We continue to carry out a retrospective analysis of a cohort of 131 patients with T2DM hospitalized for COVID-19 and treated with different combinations of diabetes medications.

   RESULTS: We found that patients using metformin (p = .02) and acarbose (p = .04), alone or both together (p = .03), after admission were significantly more likely to survive than those who did not use either metformin or acarbose. 37 patients continued to take metformin after admission and 35 (94.6%) survived. Among the 57 patients who used acarbose after admission, 52 survived (91.2%). A total of 20 patients used both metformin and acarbose, while 57 used neither. Of the 20 dual-use patients, 19 (95.0%) survived.

   CONCLUSION: Our analyses suggest that inpatient use of metformin and acarbose together or alone during hospitalization should be studied in randomized trials. Copyright © 2021 The Authors. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Abstract
  Purpose: Dipeptidylpeptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, including linagliptin, alogliptin, saxagliptin, sitagliptin, and vildagliptin, are used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients in China. This study assessed the economic outcomes of different DPP-4 inhibitors in patients with T2DM inadequately controlled with metformin in the Chinese context.

   Materials and Methods: In this study, the validated Chinese Outcomes Model for T2DM (COMT) was conducted to project economic outcomes from the perspective of Chinese healthcare service providers. Efficacy and safety, medical expenditure, and utility data were derived from the literature, which were assigned to model variables. The primary outputs of the model included the lifetime costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). One-way and probability sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the potential uncertainties of parameters.

   Results: Of the five competing strategies, alogliptin 25 mg strategy yielded the most significant health outcome, which associated with improvements in discounted QALY of 0.007, 0.014, 0.011, and 0.022 versus linagliptin 5 mg, saxagliptin 5 mg, sitagliptin 100 mg and vildagliptin50 mg, respectively. The sitagliptin 100 mg strategy was the cheapest option. The ICER of alogliptin 25 mg against sitagliptin 100 mg strategy was $6,952 per additional QALY gained, and the rest of the strategies were dominated or extended dominated. The most influential parameters were the cost of DPP-4 inhibitors and their treatment efficacy.

   Conclusions: These results suggested that alogliptin was a preferred treatment option compared with other DPP-4 inhibitors for Chinese patients whose T2DM are inadequately controlled on metformin monotherapy. Copyright © 2021 Lin, Cai, Chen, Liu, Li and Zheng.

Abstract
  AIM: SGLT2 inhibitors have been shown to reduce cardiovascular and renal complications in type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients at high cardiovascular risk. Metformin is currently widely used as initial monotherapy in T2D but lacks convincing data to show that it reduces risk of complications. We aim to compare the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin and metformin as first-line T2D medication with regard to development of complications in a registry-based randomised controlled trial.

   METHODS: The SGLT2 inhibitor or metformin as standard treatment of early stage type 2 diabetes (SMARTEST) trial will enrol 4300 subjects at 30-40 study sites in Sweden who will be randomised 1:1 to either metformin or dapagliflozin. Participants must have T2D duration <4 years, no prior cardiovascular disease, and be either drug-naive or on monotherapy for T2D.

   RESULTS: The primary endpoint is a composite of all-cause death, major adverse cardiovascular events and occurrence or progression of microvascular complications (retinopathy, nephropathy, diabetic foot lesions). Secondary endpoints include individual components of the primary endpoint, start of insulin therapy, risk factor biomarkers, patient-reported outcome measures, and cost-effectiveness analysis. Outcomes will primarily be assessed using nationwide healthcare registries.

   CONCLUSIONS: The SMARTEST trial will investigate whether dapagliflozin is superior to metformin in preventing complications in early stage T2D. (Clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT03982381, EudraCT 2019-001046-17). Copyright © 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  AIMS: Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors reduce blood pressure without compensatory heart rate elevation, possibly by modulating sympathetic/parasympathetic activity. This may contribute to their cardiovascular benefits in type 2 diabetes (T2D). We evaluated the effects of dapagliflozin (DAPA) on measures of cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN), cardiac function, and glucose variability (GV) in T2D.

   METHODS: Pilot, randomized, two-period crossover trial comparing 12-week DAPA versus 12-week glimepiride treatment on CAN measures (cardiovascular autonomic reflex tests and heart rate variability), B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), and GV (Abbott's Libre Pro devices) using signed rank tests and mixed models from baseline to 12weeks within and between each period.

   RESULTS: Forty-five T2D participants on metformin monotherapy (mean age 57+/-8years, duration 7+/-6years, HbA1c 7.8+/-1.3%) were enrolled with 41 completing the trial. There were no differences in CAN indices or BNP with each drug compared to baseline and each other. Participants on DAPA demonstrated greater weight loss, reduced time in hypoglycemia, and improved GV compared to glimepiride.

   CONCLUSIONS: Short term treatment with DAPA did not affect CAN measures or BNP in uncomplicated and relatively healthy T2D participants. Longer prospective studies in patients with advanced disease are needed to better understand relationships between SGLT-2 inhibitors and CAN.

Abstract
  AIMS: Evaluate the relationship between measures of glycemia with beta-cell function and insulin sensitivity in adults with early type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

   METHODS: This cross-sectional analysis evaluated baseline data from 3108 adults with T2DM <10years treated with metformin alone enrolled in the Glycemia Reduction Approaches in Diabetes. A Comparative Effectiveness (GRADE) Study. Insulin and C-peptide responses and insulin sensitivity were calculated from 2-h oral glucose tolerance tests. Regression models evaluated the relationships between glycemic measures (HbA1c, fasting and 2-h glucose), measures of beta-cell function and insulin sensitivity.

   RESULTS: Insulin and C-peptide responses were inversely associated with insulin sensitivity. Glycemic measures were inversely associated with insulin and C-peptide responses adjusted for insulin sensitivity. HbA1c demonstrated modest associations with beta-cell function (range: r-0.22 to -0.35). Fasting and 2-h glucose were associated with early insulin and C-peptide responses (range: r-0.37 to -0.40) as well as late insulin and total insulin and C-peptide responses (range: r-0.50 to -0.60).

   CONCLUSION: Glycemia is strongly associated with beta-cell dysfunction in adults with early T2DM treated with metformin alone. Efforts to improve glycemia should focus on interventions aimed at improving beta-cell function. This Trial is registered in Clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01794143. Copyright Published by Elsevier Inc.

Abstract
  Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a worldwide major health burden and heart failure (HF) is the most common cardiovascular (CV) complication in affected patients. Therefore, identifying the best pharmacological approach for glycemic control, which is also useful to prevent and ameliorate the prognosis of HF, represents a crucial issue. Currently, the choice is between the new drugs sodium/glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors that have consistently shown in large CV outcome trials (CVOTs) to reduce the risk of HF-related outcomes in T2DM, and metformin, an old medicament that might end up relegated to the background while exerting interesting protective effects on multiple organs among which include heart failure. When compared with other antihyperglycemic medications, metformin has been demonstrated to be safe and to lower morbidity and mortality for HF, even if these results are difficult to interpret as they emerged mainly from observational studies. Meta-analyses of randomized controlled clinical trials have not produced positive results on the risk or clinical course of HF and sadly, large CV outcome trials are lacking. The point of force of metformin with respect to new diabetic drugs is the amount of data from experimental investigations that, for more than twenty years, still continues to provide mechanistic explanations of the several favorable actions in heart failure such as, the improvement of the myocardial energy metabolic status by modulation of glucose and lipid metabolism, the attenuation of oxidative stress and inflammation, and the inhibition of myocardial cell apoptosis, leading to reduced cardiac remodeling and preserved left ventricular function. In the hope that specific large-scale trials will be carried out to definitively establish the metformin benefit in terms of HF failure outcomes, we reviewed the literature in this field, summarizing the available evidence from experimental and clinical studies reporting on effects in heart metabolism, function, and structure, and the prominent pathophysiological mechanisms involved.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Sitagliptin is known as an antidiabetic agent inhibiting the dipeptidyl peptidase-4. Although sitagliptin may influence weight, controversial results have been reported, and there is no general agreement on this issue. Therefore, this study assessed the effect of sitagliptin as monotherapy and add-on therapy to metformin on weight reduction in overweight or obese cases with type 2 diabetes.

   METHODS: We reviewed the following databases to identify all relevant papers published until 1st April 2021: Web of Science, MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar. The research included all clinical trials investigating the effect of sitagliptin in obese or overweight adult patients with type 2 diabetes without any language restriction.

   RESULTS: In total, eighteen randomized controlled trials with 2009 participants were included in our meta-analysis. Results showed supplementation of sitagliptin has led to weight loss for sitagliptin treated (MD -0.99; 95% CI; (-1.87, -0.12); p=0.026)) and sitagliptin+metformin treated groups (MD -1.09; 95% CI; (-1.69, -0.49); p<0.001)). Also, the intervention has influenced body mass index in sitagliptin treated (MD -0.23; 95% CI; (-0.45, 0.02); p=0.033)) and sitagliptin+metformin treated groups (MD -0.52; 95% CI; (-0.96, 0.08); p=0.020)) comparing to placebo.

   CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that sitagliptin administration with or without metformin might reduce the body weight and body mass index if these drugs are taken for more than 6 months. Copyright Thieme. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Hyperinsulemia and glycemic control may play a role as prostate cancer prognostic factors, whereas use of certain antidiabetic drugs, that is metformin, could improve the prognosis. We examined the link between antidiabetic medication use and prostate cancer survival taking into account simultaneous use of multiple drugs.

   METHODS: The study cohort composed of 6,537 men in The Finnish Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer with prostate cancer diagnosed 1996 to 2009. Use of medication was attained from the nationwide prescription database of the Social Insurance Institution of Finland. Median follow-up was 9.2 years postdiagnosis. A total of 1,603 (24,5%) men had used antidiabetic medication. A total of 771 men died of prostate cancer during the follow-up. We used multivariable-adjusted Cox regression to evaluate the risk of prostate cancer death and onset of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with adjustment for prostate cancer clinical characteristics, comorbidities and use of other drugs. Separate analyses were further adjusted for blood glucose.

   RESULTS: Risk of prostate cancer death was higher among antidiabetic drug users overall (HR = 1.42; 95% CI, 1.18-1.70) compared with nonusers, separately among insulin and metformin users. Adjustment for blood glucose level abolished the risk increase. Risk of ADT initiation was increased among the medication users (HR = 1.26; 95% CI, 1.05-1.49).

   CONCLUSIONS: Men with prostate cancer using antidiabetic medication are generally at increased risk of dying from prostate cancer compared with nonusers. The risk association is driven by underlying diabetes, as adjustment for blood glucose level ameliorates the risk increase.

   IMPACT: Type 2 diabetes should be considered as a risk factor when considering prostate cancer prognosis. Copyright ©2021 American Association for Cancer Research.

Abstract
  Objective: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is highly prevalent in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Studies on glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists for the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease have reported promising results. Despite this, there has been limited evidence of its efficacy in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. This meta-analysis examined existing evidence on the efficacy of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists on the management of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

   Methods: Medline, Embase and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) were searched for articles discussing the efficacy of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Values of standardized mean differences (SMD) and risk ratio (RR) were determined for continuous outcomes and dichotomous outcomes respectively.

   Results: 8 studies involving 1,454 patients from 5 randomized controlled trials and 3 cohort studies were included in the analysis. Our analysis found significant improvements in hepatic fat content, liver biochemistry, body composition, glucose parameters, lipid parameters, insulin sensitivity and inflammatory markers following glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist treatment. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists significantly decreased hepatic fat content compared to metformin and insulin-based therapies. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists also improved fibrosis markers, but this did not reach statistical significance.

   Conclusion: With a high prevalence of obesity and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist treatment shows promise in improving both diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease phenotype.

Abstract
  In type 1 diabetes mellitus and in symptomatic and critical hyperglycemic states, insulin is a lifesaving drug; however, its value in long-term type 2 diabetes therapy, which represents more than 90% of diabetes, has not been assessed. This happens despite the fact that, in randomized studies on type 2 diabetes, insulin is used in two-thirds of cases when intensive hypoglycemic treatment is needed and in half of the patients when treatment is the standard one. This is a major issue from a clinical, economic and social-health organization point of view as insulin therapy is expensive and needs a complex organization. Observational and retrospective studies from the scientific literature show that in this type of diabetes insulin treatment is associated with increased cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. It is not clear whether this is due to a greater severity of the clinical picture, to the therapeutic target of blood glucose that may induce hypoglycemia, or to the intrinsic pharmacological activity of the drug that beyond reducing hyperglycemia can cause hypoglycemia, water retention, weight gain and hyperinsulinemia with proatherogenic effects. In particular, in patients with heart failure at high cardiovascular risk or with high insulin resistance, these clues are supported by meaningful data. Although there is no definitive evidence (the so-called "smoking gun") from randomized controlled trials, the high degree of suspicion induces the preferential choice of other drugs such as sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and metformin beyond avoiding glycemic targets that induce hypoglycemia, especially in frail, elderly patients, or patients with cardiovascular diseases. These drugs, for their proven efficacy and the easy use within an outpatient setting (that favors their prescription and improves the inertia of the doctor and the adherence of patients), could help a more effective treatment of patients, both for quality and life expectancy beyond mere glycemic control.

Abstract
  Formation of reactive oxygen species has been linked to the development of diabetes complications. Treatment with metformin has been associated with a lower risk of developing diabetes complications, including when used in combination with insulin. Metformin inhibits Complex 1 in isolated mitochondria and thereby decreases the formation of reactive oxygen species. Thus, we post-hoc investigated the effect of metformin in combination with different insulin regimens on RNA and DNA oxidation in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Four hundred and fifteen individuals with type 2 diabetes were randomized (1:1) to blinded treatment with metformin (1,000 mg twice daily) versus placebo and to (1:1:1) open-label biphasic insulin, basal-bolus insulin, or basal insulin therapy in a 2 x 3 factorial design. RNA and DNA oxidation were determined at baseline and after 18 months measured as urinary excretions of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanosine (8-oxoGuo) and 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG), respectively. Urinary excretion of 8-oxoGuo changed by +7.1% (95% CI: 0.5% to 14.0%, P = 0.03) following metformin versus placebo, whereas changes in 8-oxodG were comparable between intervention groups. Biphasic insulin decreased urinary excretion of 8-oxoGuo (within-group: -9.6% (95% CI: -14.4% to -4.4%)) more than basal-bolus insulin (within-group: 5.2% (95% CI: -0.5% to 11.2%)), P = 0.0002 between groups, and basal insulin (within-group: 3.7% (95% CI: -2.0% to 9.7%)), P = 0.0007 between groups. Urinary excretion of 8-oxodG decreased more in the biphasic insulin group (within-group: -9.9% (95% CI: -14.4% to -5.2%)) than basal-bolus insulin (within group effect: -1.2% (95% CI: -6.1% to 3.9%)), P = 0.01 between groups, whereas no difference was observed compared with basal insulin. In conclusion, eighteen months of metformin treatment in addition to different insulin regimens increased RNA oxidation, but not DNA oxidation. Biphasic insulin decreased both RNA and DNA oxidation compared with other insulin regimens. Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: We aimed to assess efficacy and safety, with a special focus on cardiovascular safety, of the novel dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist tirzepatide versus insulin glargine in adults with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular risk inadequately controlled on oral glucose-lowering medications.

   METHODS: This open-label, parallel-group, phase 3 study was done in 187 sites in 14 countries on five continents. Eligible participants, aged 18 years or older, had type 2 diabetes treated with any combination of metformin, sulfonylurea, or sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor, a baseline glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) of 7.5-10.5% (58-91 mmol/mol), body-mass index of 25 kg/m2 or greater, and established cardiovascular disease or a high risk of cardiovascular events. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1:3) via an interactive web-response system to subcutaneous injection of either once-per-week tirzepatide (5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg) or glargine (100 U/mL), titrated to reach fasting blood glucose of less than 100 mg/dL. The primary endpoint was non-inferiority (0.3% non-inferiority boundary) of tirzepatide 10 mg or 15 mg, or both, versus glargine in HbA1c change from baseline to 52 weeks. All participants were treated for at least 52 weeks, with treatment continued for a maximum of 104 weeks or until study completion to collect and adjudicate major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Safety measures were assessed over the full study period. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03730662.

   FINDINGS: Patients were recruited between Nov 20, 2018, and Dec 30, 2019. 3045 participants were screened, with 2002 participants randomly assigned to tirzepatide or glargine. 1995 received at least one dose of tirzepatide 5 mg (n=329, 17%), 10 mg (n=328, 16%), or 15 mg (n=338, 17%), or glargine (n=1000, 50%), and were included in the modified intention-to-treat population. At 52 weeks, mean HbA1c changes with tirzepatide were -2.43% (SD 0.05) with 10 mg and -2.58% (0.05) with 15 mg, versus -1.44% (0.03) with glargine. The estimated treatment difference versus glargine was -0.99% (multiplicity adjusted 97.5% CI -1.13 to -0.86) for tirzepatide 10 mg and -1.14% (-1.28 to -1.00) for 15 mg, and the non-inferiority margin of 0.3% was met for both doses. Nausea (12-23%), diarrhoea (13-22%), decreased appetite (9-11%), and vomiting (5-9%) were more frequent with tirzepatide than glargine (nausea 2%, diarrhoea 4%, decreased appetite <1%, and vomiting 2%, respectively); most cases were mild to moderate and occurred during the dose-escalation phase. The percentage of participants with hypoglycaemia (glucose <54 mg/dL or severe) was lower with tirzepatide (6-9%) versus glargine (19%), particularly in participants not on sulfonylureas (tirzepatide 1-3% vs glargine 16%). Adjudicated MACE-4 events (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalisation for unstable angina) occurred in 109 participants and were not increased on tirzepatide compared with glargine (hazard ratio 0.74, 95% CI 0.51-1.08). 60 deaths (n=25 [3%] tirzepatide; n=35 [4%] glargine) occurred during the study.

   INTERPRETATION: In people with type 2 diabetes and elevated cardiovascular risk, tirzepatide, compared with glargine, demonstrated greater and clinically meaningful HbA1c reduction with a lower incidence of hypoglycaemia at week 52. Tirzepatide treatment was not associated with excess cardiovascular risk.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To compare the incident risk of RA in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and to explore the role of glycaemic control and associated therapeutic use in the onset of RA.

   METHODS: This study was a retrospective cohort study using patients derived from the IQVIA Medical Research Data (IMRD-UK) database between 1995 and 2019. A total of 224 551 newly diagnosed patients with T2DM were matched to 449 101 patients without T2DM and followed up to assess their risk of RA. Further analyses investigated the effect of glycaemic control, statin use and anti-diabetic drugs on the relationship between T2DM and RA using a time-dependent Cox regression model.

   RESULTS: During the study period, the incidence of RA was 8.1 and 10.6 per 10 000 person-years in the exposed and unexposed groups, respectively. The adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) was 0.73 (95% CI 0.67, 0.79). In patients who had not used statins in their lifetime, the aHR was 0.89 (95% CI 0.69, 1.14). When quantifying the effects of glycaemic control, anti-diabetic drugs and statins using time-varying analyses, there was no association with glycaemic control [aHR 1.00 (95% CI 0.99, 1.00)], use of metformin [aHR 1.00 (95% CI 0.82, 1.22)], dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors [DPP4is; aHR 0.94 (95% CI 0.71, 1.24)] and the development of RA. However, statins demonstrated a protective effect for progression of RA in those with T2DM [aHR 0.76 (95% CI 0.66, 0.88)], with evidence of a duration-response relationship.

   CONCLUSION: There is a reduced risk of RA in patients with T2DM that may be attributable to the use of statins. Copyright © The Author(s) 2021. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the British Society for Rheumatology.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: The most recent treatment guidelines for type 2 diabetes (T2D) recommend sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors should be considered preferentially in patients with T2D with either a high cardiovascular risk or with cardiovascular disease (CVD), regardless of their diabetes status and prior use of conventional metformin therapy. Whether the therapeutic impact of SGLT2 inhibitors on clinical parameters differs according to the use of metformin therapy however remains unclear.

   METHODS: The study was a post hoc analysis of the EMBLEM trial (UMIN000024502). All participants (n = 105; women 31.4%; mean age 64.8 years) had both T2D and CVD and were randomized to either 24 weeks of empagliflozin 10 mg daily or placebo. Analysis of the data assessed the effect of empagliflozin on changes from baseline to 24 weeks in glycemic and non-glycemic clinical parameters, according to the baseline use of metformin.

   RESULTS: Overall, 53 (50.5%) patients received baseline metformin. In the 52 patients treated with empagliflozin (48.1% with baseline metformin), the decrease in systolic blood pressure from baseline levels was greater in patients receiving metformin, compared to that observed in metformin-naive patients (group difference - 8.5 [95% confidence interval (CI) - 17.7 to 0.6 mmHg], p = 0.066). Reduction in body mass index (BMI) was significantly greater in patients receiving baseline metformin, relative to nonusers (- 0.54 [95% CI - 1.07 to - 0.01] kg/m2, p = 0.047). The group ratio (baseline metformin users vs. nonusers) of proportional changes in the geometric mean of high-sensitivity Troponin-I (hs-TnI) was 0.74 (95% CI 0.59 to 0.92, p = 0.009). No obvious differences were observed in glycemic parameters (fasting plasma glucose, glycohemoglobin, and glycoalbumin) between the baseline metformin users and nonusers.

   CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest 24 weeks of empagliflozin treatment was associated with an improvement in glycemic control, irrespective of the baseline use of metformin therapy. The effects of empagliflozin on reductions in BMI and hs-TnI were more apparent in patients who received baseline metformin therapy, compared to that observed in metformin-naive patients.

Abstract
  AIMS/INTRODUCTION: The prevalence and pathophysiological background of type 2 diabetes mellitus vary across ethnicities, and can affect treatment responses. Adding lixisenatide to basal insulin (BI) in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients has shown improvements in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and postprandial glycemic (PPG) excursions, without increasing hypoglycemic events. We aim to compare the efficacy of lixisenatide in Asian and white patients inadequately controlled with basal insulin.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: An individual-level pooled analysis of two multi-national phase III studies, GetGoal-L and GetGoal-L-C, was carried out to assess the efficacy of lixisenatide versus placebo as an add-on treatment to BI +/- metformin in Asian and white patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Change in HbA1c, 2-h PPG and PPG excursion were analyzed, along with possible predictors of glycemic control.

   RESULTS: Pooled data showed that baseline characteristics were similar between Asian and white patients with the exception of bodyweight, body mass index and BI dose being higher in white patients. After 24 weeks, lixisenatide reduced HbA1c in both ethnic groups, with no statistically significant difference between the two groups (Asian patients least squares mean difference -0.49, 95% confidence interval -0.68 to - 0.30 and white patients least squares mean difference -0.45, 95% confidence interval -0.63 to - 0.26; P = 0.6287). Similarly, no significant difference was found in 2-h PPG reduction between both groups (least squares mean difference for Asian vs white patients: -3.37 vs -3.93; P = 0.3203). Treatment with lixisenatide contributed to HbA1c reduction of -0.56% after adjustment of baseline HbA1c level in Asian patients, and -0.41% in white patients.

   CONCLUSIONS: Adding lixisenatide to BI significantly reduced HbA1c and 2-h PPG levels in both Asian and white participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus. No differences in treatment effect were observed between the two populations. Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Latent Autoimmune Diabetes of Adulthood (LADA) is different from type 2 diabetes. Present treatment protocols do not reflect that. DPP-4 and SGLT2 inhibitors have changed therapy. DPP-4 inhibitor use has shown delayed decline in beta-cell reserve in LADA. We studied patients with low c-peptide to assess relationship between c-peptide and anti-GAD65 antibody levels and compare DPP-4 inhibitors with SGLT2 inhibitors and sulphonylureas.

   METHODS: The study was an open-label trial conducted in 156 participants with low c-peptide (<0.8 ng/mL), age > 25 years, recently diagnosed diabetes with HBA1c >= 6.5%. Participants were enrolled into three arms: Group A received sulphonylureas + metformin, Group B received DPP-4 inhibitors + metformin, and Group C received SGLT-2 inhibitors + metformin. Serum anti-GAD-65 antibodies were assessed using sandwich ELISA. Participants were assessed on enrolment and after three months of dual pharmacotherapy.

   RESULTS: The three arms were comparable on enrolment. 52% of participants with low c-peptide had high anti-GAD65 antibody titers. Significant differences were observed after three months - DPP-4 inhibitors reduced HbA1c by 1.1 +/- 0.3%, compared to SGLT2 inhibitors (0.8 +/- 0.13%) and sulphonylureas (0.7 +/- 0.3%) CONCLUSION: DPP-4 inhibitors appear to provide better glycemic control than alternate therapeutic options in patients with low serum c-peptide.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: Antihyperglycemic activity of Thymoquinone (TQ) was evaluated in diabetic mouse model and patients.

   METHODS: TQ (50 mg/kg) was orally administered daily for 21 days in combination with metformin in diabetic mice and a reduction on blood glucose level was monitored. In human, a 90-day randomized study was carried out in 60 Type 2 Diabetes mellitus patients to evaluate safety and efficacy of TQ administration with metformin in a 3-arm study. Patients in arm 1 (T1) received 1 tablet of metformin SR 1000 mg and 1 tablet of TQ 50 mg once daily. The second arm (T2) patients received 1 tablet of metformin SR 1000 mg and 2 tablets of TQ 50 mg once daily. Patients in arm 3 (R) received 1 tablet of metformin SR 1000 mg only.

   RESULTS: The diabetic mice treated with combination of TQ and metformin showed significant decrease in blood sugar compared to those treated with only metformin. In patients who completed the study, the glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) values in T1, T2 and R decreased after 3 months from 7.2, 7.2 and 7.3 to 6.7, 6.8, and 7.1, respectively. A greater reduction in Fasting Blood Glucose and Post Prandial Blood Glucose was also observed in T1 and T2 arms compared to R.

   CONCLUSION: At dose levels of 50 and 100 mg of TQ combined with a daily dose of 1000 mg Metformin demonstrated a reduction in the levels of HbA1c and blood glucose compared to the standard treatment of diabetic patients with metformin alone. Copyright Thieme. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  CONTEXT: The results of the present study demonstrate that beta cell function in newly diagnosed T2DM patients is the key predictor of response to glucose lowering medications and provides a practical tool (C-Pep120 /C-Pep0) to guide the choice of glucose lowering agent.

   OBJECTIVE: This work aims to identify predictors for individualization of antidiabetic therapy in patients with new-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

   METHODS: A total of 261 drug-naive participants in the Efficacy and Durability of Initial Combination Therapy for Type 2 Diabetes (EDICT) study, with new-onset diabetes, were randomly assigned in a single-center study to receive 1) metformin followed by glipizide and then insulin glargine on failure to achieve glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) less than 6.5%, or 2) initial triple therapy with metformin/pioglitazone/exenatide. Each patient received a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) prior to start of therapy. Factors that predicted response to therapy were identified using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve method.

   RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients started and maintained the treatment goal (HbA1c < 6.5%) on metformin only, and did not require intensification of antihyperglycemic therapy; 54 patients required addition of glipizide to metformin; and 47 patients required insulin addition to metformin plus glipizide for glucose control. The plasma C-peptide concentration (C-Pep)120/C-Pep0 ratio during the OGTT was the strongest predictor of response to therapy. Patients with a ratio less than 1.78 were more likely to require insulin for glucose control, whereas patients with a ratio greater than 2.65 were more likely to achieve glucose control with metformin monotherapy. In patients started on initial triple therapy, the HbA1c decreased independently of the C-Pep120/C-Pep0 ratio.

   CONCLUSION: The increase in C-Pep above fasting following glucose load predicts the response to antihyperglycemic therapy in patients with new-onset diabetes. C-Pep120/C-Pep0 provides a useful tool for the individualization of antihyperglycemic therapy in patients with new-onset T2DM. Copyright © The Author(s) 2021.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are characterized by an elevated glycemic index and are at a higher risk for complications such as cardiovascular disease, nephropathy, retinopathy and peripheral neuropathy. Normalization of glycemic index can be achieved by dosing combinations of metformin with other anti-diabetic drugs. The present study (Clintrials number NCT00519480) was conducted to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of remogliflozinetabonate, an SGLT2 inhibitor, withdoses (500 mg and 750 mg BID) greater than the commercial dose (100 mg BID)in combination with metformin with minimum daily dose of 2000 mg given in two divided doses.

   METHODS: This was a randomized, double-blinded, repeat dose study in 50 subjects with T2DM. The study was conducted in three phases; run-in, randomization, and treatment. All subjects were on a stable metformin dosing regimen. Cohort 1 subjects were randomly allocated to receive either remogliflozin etabonate 500 mg BID or placebo BID (2:1) in addition to metformin. Cohort 2 subjects were administered with either remogliflozin etabonate 750 mg BID or placebo BID (2:1) in addition to metformin for 13 days. All the subjects were assessed for safety (adverse events, lactic acid levels, vital signs, electrocardiogram [ECG]), pharmacokinetic evaluation, and pharmacodynamics (Oral Glucose Tolerance Testing) parameters.

   RESULTS: Co-administration of remogliflozin etabonate and metformin was well tolerated in all subjects during the observation period. There were no severe or serious adverse events (SAEs) and no increase in lactic acid concentration was reported during the study. The statistical results showed that concomitant administration of remogliflozin etabonate, either 500 mg or 750 mg BID, with metformin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of metformin. The accumulation ratios, Day 13 vs. Day 1, for AUC values of remogliflozin etabonate and its metabolites were all very close to 1, indicating no accumulation in plasma concentrations of remogliflozin etabonate and its metabolites. Mean glucose values from baseline and glucose and insulin values following oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) were decreased in all treatment groups.

   CONCLUSION: Co-administration of doses of remogliflozin etabonate (500 mg BID or 750 mg BID) greater than the commercial dose (100 mg BID) with metformin (2000 mg BID) was shown to be safe and effective during the observation period.

Abstract
  Recent randomized trials demonstrating the beneficial effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) in type 2 diabetes suggest that early reductions in eGFR upon initiation of SGLT2i therapy are associated with improved renal outcomes. Multiple concomitant medications, including antidiabetic and antihypertensive agents, are commonly used, however, which may modify the renal hemodynamic action of SGLT2is. Here we found that background treatment with metformin diminished the SGLT2i-induced reductions in eGFR after 3 months of SGLT2i therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes and hypertension (-2.29 +/- 0.90 vs -5.85 +/- 1.27 mL/min/1.73 m2 for metformin users (n = 126) and nonusers (n = 97), respectively). Other antidiabetic agents (DPP4 inhibitors, sulfonylureas and insulin) had no effect on the eGFR response to SGLT2is. Antihypertensive drugs, including calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and beta blockers, did not affect the SGLT2i-induced changes in eGFR, whereas renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RASis) tended to enhance this response (p = 0.059). Next, we evaluated the interaction between metformin and RASis in the eGFR responses to SGLT2is. Under no background treatment with RASis, metformin abrogated the eGFR response to SGLT2is, but this response was preserved when RASis had been given along with metformin (decreases of 0.75 +/- 1.28 vs. 4.60 +/- 1.15 mL/min/1.73 m2 in eGFR, p = 0.028). No interaction between metformin and insulin or between metformin and DPP4 inhibitors was observed. In conclusion, metformin blunts the SGLT2i-induced decrease in eGFR, but coadministration of RASis ameliorates this response. Furthermore, the inability of CCBs to modify the SGLT2i-induced reduction in eGFR suggests that the SGLT2i-induced renal microvascular action is mediated predominantly by postglomerular vasodilation rather than preglomerular vasoconstriction.

Abstract
  Vitamin D deficiency could play an important role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) as it may alter several crucial processes in the development of diabetes and its complications, such as pancreatic insulin secretion, peripheral insulin resistance, persistence of systemic "sterile" inflammation and immune activation. Vitamin D may also have an antioxidant effect through the inhibition of free radicals generation. The reported study was designed with eligible consecutively recruited patients with T2DM on standard metformin therapy (n=130), randomized in 1:1 ratio, considered to have undergone Vitamin D supplementation according to the guidelines proposed by the Endocrine Society, or to have continued with metformin only. The potential benefit was monitored through the influence on glycemia level, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), insulin resistance index (calculated as homeostatic model assessment; HOMA-IR), Castelli Risk Index I and Tryglicerides/Thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TG/TBARS) Index in a 6-month follow up period. Our study indicates that oral daily doses of vitamin D improve HbA1c levels over the 3-month and 6-month period, followed by a significant decrease in advanced oxidation protein products levels over the 3-month period when higher vitamin D doses are given. The effect of vitamin D on HOMA-IR index, malondialdehyde levels and TG/TBARS index was not statistically significant. Further investigation should consider defining the doses of vitamin D in patients with T2DM which may attenuate the oxidative stress risk, the risk of metabolic syndrome and the risk of related cardiovascular events.

Abstract
  Metformin, a commonly used well-tolerated treatment for type 2 diabetes, is being deployed in clinical trials to ameliorate aging in older nondiabetic humans. Concerningly, some experiments in model organisms have suggested that metformin use at old ages shortens life span and is toxic to mitochondria. The demonstrated safety of metformin therapy in humans and the conflicting data from model organisms compelled us to test the hypothesis that metformin treatment would be toxic to older rats. To define an effective dose in 30-month-old hybrid rats, we evaluated two doses of metformin (0.1%, 0.75% of the diet) and treated the rats for 4 months. Body mass decreased at the 0.75% dose. Neither dose affected mortality between 30 and 34 months of age. We assessed mitochondrial integrity by measuring mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number and deletion mutation frequency, and mitochondrial respiration in skeletal muscle and the heart. In skeletal muscle, we observed no effect of metformin on quadriceps mass, mtDNA copy number, or deletion frequency. In the heart, metformin-treated rats had higher mtDNA copy number, lower cardiac mass, with no change in mtDNA deletion frequency. Metformin treatment resulted in lower mitochondrial complex I-dependent respiration in the heart. We found that, in old rats, metformin did not compromise mtDNA integrity, did not affect mortality, and may have cardiac benefits. These data provide some reassurance that a metformin intervention in aged mammals is not toxic at appropriate doses.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: The objective was to capture the breadth of outcomes that have been associated with metformin use and to systematically assess the quality, strength and credibility of these associations using the umbrella review methodology.

   METHODS: Four major databases were searched until 31 May 2020. Meta-analyses of observational studies and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (including active and placebo control arms) were included.

   RESULTS: From 175 eligible publications, we identified 427 different meta-analyses, including 167 meta-analyses of observational studies, 147 meta-analyses of RCTs for metformin vs placebo/no treatment and 113 meta-analyses of RCTs for metformin vs active medications. There was no association classified as convincing or highly suggestive from meta-analyses of observational studies, but some suggestive/weak associations of metformin use with a lower mortality risk of CVD and cancer. In meta-analyses of RCTs, metformin was associated with a lower incidence of diabetes in people with prediabetes or no diabetes at baseline; lower ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome incidence (in women in controlled ovarian stimulation); higher success for clinical pregnancy rate in poly-cystic ovary syndrome (PCOS); and significant reduction in body mass index in people with type 1 diabetes mellitus, in women who have obesity/overweight with PCOS and in obese/overweight women. Of 175 publications, 166 scored as low or critically low quality per AMSTAR 2 criteria.

   CONCLUSIONS: Observational evidence on metformin seems largely unreliable. Randomized evidence shows benefits for preventing diabetes and in some gynaecological and obstetrical settings. However, almost all meta-analyses are of low or critically low quality according to AMSTAR 2 criteria. Copyright © 2021 Stichting European Society for Clinical Investigation Journal Foundation.

Abstract
  AIMS: To investigate the long-term effectiveness and safety of two distinct sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, empagliflozin and dapagliflozin, in inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes (T2D) despite a combined administration of metformin, glimepiride and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor.

   METHODS: A total of 362 patients with T2D were enrolled for this 3-year open-label, prospective observational study. Empagliflozin (25 mg/day, n = 185) or dapagliflozin (10 mg/day, n = 177) was added to the existing triple drug regimen. HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), body weight, and other cardiometabolic variables and adverse events were evaluated.

   RESULTS: At 3 years, changes in HbA1c and FPG were -1.7% (standard error [SE] 0.10) and -60.0 mg/dL(2.2), and -1.1%(0.12) and -48.1 mg/dL(3.6), for empagliflozin and dapagliflozin group, respectively (P = 0.001 and P = 0.055). Empagliflozin group showed significantly greater body weight reduction (-4.5 kg [SE 0.35] vs. -1.0 kg [SE 0.40], P = 0.024) and had beneficial effects on HDL cholesterol and LDL cholesterol (both P < 0.05). The overall incidence of adverse events, cardiovascular events and mortality did not differ between the two groups.

   CONCLUSIONS: Quadruple combination therapy with either empagliflozin or dapagliflozin showed a positive long-term effect in the glycemic control and body weight reduction with generally well tolerance. In general, the use of empagliflozin performed better than dapagliflozin. Clinical Trial Number NCT03748810 (ClinicalTrials.gov). Copyright © 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: Sodium Glucose Co-transporter 2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) were associated with a reduction in cardiovascular disease events in cardiovascular outcomes trials (CVOTs) in type 2 diabetes. Most of the patients included in these trials received metformin as background therapy.

   AIM: To evaluate the effect of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists on major cardiovascular events (MACE) and mortality in metformin-naive patients with type 2 diabetes.

   METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled clinical trials of GLP-1RAs on type 2 diabetes population was performed, after searching the PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Scielo, Google Scholar and Cochrane Controlled Trials databases. The primary endpoint was MACE. The secondary endpoints were cardiovascular death and all-cause mortality. A meta-analysis of time-to-event outcomes was performed. This meta-analysis was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42021260040) RESULTS: Seven trials, including 11510 patients, were identified and considered eligible for the analyses. GLP-1RAs were associated with a significant reduction in MACE incidence (HR: 0.86, 95% confidence interval: 0.79-0.94; I2: 0%). The secondary endpoints analysis showed a non-significant reduction in all-cause mortality (HR: 0.86, 95% confidence interval: 0.73-1.00 I2: 0%) and cardiovascular mortality (HR: 0.81, 95% confidence interval: 0.63-1.05; I2: 0%).

   CONCLUSIONS: In this meta-analysis, GLP-1RAs reduced the incidence of MACE in patients with type 2 diabetes without metformin at baseline, without significant reduction in all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality. These results support the fact that when a GLP-1RAs is administered, the benefit on cardiovascular outcomes is independent of the use of metformin. Copyright © 2021. Italian Society of Hypertension.

Abstract
  Diabetes mellitus is a major, global problem. Among the numerous complications of diabetes, there is increasing concern over the coexisting heart failure. Metformin is the most frequently used oral antidiabetic drug that is considered to be safe and effective in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Since the publication of the UK Prospective Diabetes Study, it has been suggested that metformin might improve cardiovascular prognoses. Results from available studies have shown that metformin therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart failure was associated with improved clinical outcomes when compared with other oral antidiabetic agents, insulin, or lifestyle management. However, there have been no randomized controlled trials evaluating the influence of metformin use on clinical outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart failure. New evidence from large cardiovascular outcome trials that showed a reduction in heart failure hospitalization for SGLT2 inhibitors caused changes in recommendations on the management of hyperglycaemia. Currently, the European Society of Cardiology recommends sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart failure or at high risk for heart failure, as a first choice in drug naive patients, or as a second drug if the patient is already on metformin. The aim of our study is to review the current state of knowledge about the position of metformin in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart failure.

Abstract
  Objective: We aimed to investigate the effect of dosage reduction of four hypoglycemic multidrug regimens on the incidences of acute glycemic complications in people with type 2 diabetes who fast during Ramadan.

   Methods: We conducted an open-label, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial at a tertiary care center in Amman, Jordan. We recruited adults with type 2 diabetes who expressed an intention to fast during Ramadan and were adherent to one of four regimens-namely: metformin and glimepiride; metformin and vildagliptin; metformin and insulin glargine U100; or, metformin, insulin glargine U100, and human regular insulin. We randomly assigned participants in a 2:1 ratio to low- or regular-dosage therapy. The primary outcomes were the incidences of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia during the 29 days of Ramadan 2017, and the secondary outcomes were the incidences of diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state during the same period.

   Results: We randomly assigned 687 participants to low-dosage therapy (n = 458) or regular-dosage therapy (n = 229) and included 678 (452 and 226, respectively) in the final analysis. The incidence of hypoglycemia was lower in the low-dosage group compared with the regular-dosage group (19 [4.2%] vs. 52 [23.0%], respectively; OR, 0.15 [95% CI, 0.08-0.26]; P < 0.001). The incidence of hyperglycemia did not differ between the low- and regular-dosage groups (319 [70.6%] vs. 154 [68.1%], respectively; OR, 1.12 [95% CI, 0.79-1.58]; P = 0.5). No participants experienced diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state. Each 1% decrease in the baseline HbA1c concentration was associated with a 19.9-fold (95% CI, 9.6-41.5; P < 0.001) increase in the odds of hypoglycemia, and each 1% increase in the baseline HbA1c concentration was associated with a 15.7-fold (95% CI, 10.0-24.6; P < 0.001) increase in the odds of hyperglycemia.

   Conclusion: Dosage reduction decreases the incidence of hypoglycemia without a concomitant increase in the incidences of hyperglycemia, diabetic ketoacidosis, and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state in people with type 2 diabetes who fast during Ramadan.

Abstract
  Oral semaglutide (Rybelsus R) is a co-formulation of semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1 RA) receptor agonist, with an absorption enhancer, sodium N- (8- [2- hydroxybenzoyl] amino) caprylate (SNAC), which facilitates the absorption of semaglutide across the gastric epithelium in a concentration dependent manner. The safety and efficacy of oral semaglutide were assessed in the PIONEER clinical trial programme, which included 9543 patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Across a range of different T2DM patients receiving different background medications, oral semaglutide provides more effective glycaemic control than common oral glucose-lowering therapies, associated with a clinically relevant reduction in body weight, including in patients with more advanced T2DM on insulin treatment. The tolerability profile for oral semaglutide was consistent with the other GLP-1 RAs. Cardiovascular (CV) safety of oral semaglutide was noninferior to placebo in CV high-risk patients. Available in three doses (3, 7 and 14 mg) to be gradually increased, Rybelsus R is currently reimbursed in Belgium after failure of antidiabetic treatment (including metformin; HbA1C superior to 7.5 % or 58 mmol/mol) in T2DM patients with a body mass index ? 30 kg/m2.

  Publisher Le semaglutide oral (Rybelsus R) est une co-formulation du semaglutide, agoniste des recepteurs du glucagon-like peptide-1 (AR GLP-1), couple a un rehausseur d'absorption, le sodium N-(8-[2-hydroxybenzoyl] amino) caprylate (SNAC), ce qui facilite le passage du semaglutide au travers de l'epithelium gastrique de maniere dose-dependante. La securite et l'efficacite du semaglutide oral (SO) ont ete evaluees dans le programme d'etudes cliniques PIONEER, qui a inclus 9.543 patients diabetiques de type 2 (DT2). Dans une large gamme de patients DT2 ayant beneficie de differents medicaments hypoglycemiants prealables, le SO permet d'obtenir un controle glycemique plus efficace qu'avec les traitements hypoglycemiants oraux courants, ainsi qu'une perte de poids interessante, y compris chez les patients atteints de DT2 plus avance traites par insuline. Le profil de tolerance du SO est comparable aux autres AR GLP-1 et la securite cardiovasculaire etablie chez des patients a haut risque par rapport au placebo (non-inferiorite). Disponible en trois posologies (3, 7 et 14 mg) a accroitre progressivement, Rybelsus R est rembourse en Belgique apres echec d'un traitement antidiabetique (dont la metformine; HbA1C suprieur a 7,5 % ou 58 mmol/mol) chez des patients DT2 avec un indice de masse corporelle ? 30 kg/m2.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: The association between pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) has long been evaluated and the role of antidiabetic medications such as metformin has also been investigated. The objective of this study was to examine the association between insulin use and overall survival (OS) in patients with advanced PDAC and DM2.

   METHODS: We retrospectively collected data from 164 patients, including an exploratory cohort of 96 patients from Medical Oncology Unit, University Hospital and University of Cagliari, Italy, and a validation cohort of 68 patients from Medical Oncology of Modena University Hospital. Patients had metastatic disease and received a first-line gemcitabine-based chemotherapy and, subsequently, a second-line fluoropyrimidines-based chemotherapy. We performed univariate analysis to evaluate correlation between long-term diabetes and overall survival. Then we performed multivariate analysis, adjusting for sex, metastatic sites, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status, Ca19.9 levels, N/L ratio, and lactate dehydrogenase levels at diagnosis, to confirm the independence of the variable.

   RESULTS: In the exploratory cohort, DM2 was significantly associated with higher median OS at univariate analysis (16 vs 10 months; p = 0.004). This result was confirmed by validation cohort (11 months vs 6 months; p = 0.01). In multivariate analysis, insulin-treated patients compared with non diabetic patients showed a significantly increased survival of 4.6 months (p = 0.03).

   CONCLUSIONS: Patients with insulin-treated metastatic PDAC showed better OS than non diabetic patients, as demonstrated by both cohorts. The correlation between OS and insulin-treated DM2 should be investigated further through a prospective clinical trial.

Abstract
  CONTEXT: There is little information about fatty liver in prediabetes as it transitions to early diabetes.

   OBJECTIVE: This study is aimed at evaluating the prevalence and determinants of fatty liver in the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP).

   METHODS: We measured liver fat as liver attenuation (LA) in Hounsfield units (HU) in 1876 participants at ~14 years following randomization into the DPP, which tested the effects of lifestyle or metformin interventions versus standard care to prevent diabetes. LA was compared among intervention groups and in those with versus without diabetes, and associations with baseline and follow-up measurements of anthropometric and metabolic covariates were assessed.

   RESULTS: There were no differences in liver fat between treatment groups at 14 years of follow-up. Participants with diabetes had lower LA (mean +/- SD: 46 +/- 16 vs 51 +/- 14 HU; P < 0.001) and a greater prevalence of fatty liver (LA < 40 HU) (34% vs 17%; P < 0.001). Severity of metabolic abnormalities at the time of LA evaluation was associated with lower LA categories in a graded manner and more strongly in those with diabetes. Averaged annual fasting insulin (an index of insulin resistance [OR, 95% CI 1.76, 1.41-2.20]) waist circumference (1.63, 1.17-2.26), and triglyceride (1.42, 1.13-1.78), but not glucose, were independently associated with LA < 40 HU prevalence.

   CONCLUSION: Fatty liver is common in the early phases of diabetes development. The association of LA with insulin resistance, waist circumference, and triglyceride levels emphasizes the importance of these markers for hepatic steatosis in this population and that assessment of hepatic fat in early diabetes development is warranted.

Abstract
  AIMS: To evaluate the effect of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) on major cardiovascular events (MACE) in metformin-naive patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D).

   METHODS AND RESULTS: A meta-analysis was performed of randomized controlled clinical trials of GLP-1RAs and SGLT-2 inhibitors on T2D populations, after searching the PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Controlled Trials databases. The primary endpoint was MACE. The secondary endpoint, explored in the subgroup of SGLT-2 inhibitors studies, was cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure. A random-effects meta-analysis model was applied. Six eligible trials (three studies of SGLT-2 inhibitors and three trials of GLP-1RAs), including 13 049 patients, were identified and considered eligible for the analyses. The new antidiabetic drugs were associated with a significant reduction in MACE [odds ratio (OR): 0.80, 95% confidence interval: 0.70-0.93; I2: 53%]. The subgroup analysis showed the following findings: GLP-1RAs group, OR: 0.77 (95% confidence interval 0.67-0.88); SGLT-2 inhibitors, OR: 0.85 (95% confidence interval 0.63-1.15). SGLT-2 inhibitors were associated with a significant reduction in hospitalization for heart failure or cardiovascular mortality incidence (OR: 0.67, 95% confidence interval: 0.47-0.95; I2: 78%).

   CONCLUSION: In this meta-analysis, new antidiabetic drugs reduced the incidence of MACE in metformin-naive T2D patients. The beneficial effect was especially observed in the GLP-1RAs subgroup. The use of SGLT-2 inhibitors was associated with a reduction in cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure. These results support the fact that metformin would not be indispensable to obtain positive cardiovascular effects when new antidiabetic drugs are administered.

Abstract
  The AWARD-11 trial demonstrated the safety and efficacy of dulaglutide 3.0 and 4.5 mg compared to dulaglutide 1.5 mg in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin. This post hoc analysis examined the change from baseline in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and proportions of patients achieving HbA1c <7% at weeks 36 and 52 with dulaglutide 1.5 mg, 3.0 mg or 4.5 mg across clinically relevant baseline HbA1c subgroups (<8%; 8.0% to < 9.0%; 9.0% to < 10%; and >= 10%). Mean reductions in HbA1c were observed across all baseline HbA1c subgroups at 36 weeks (range of HbA1c change: 1.5 mg: -1.0% to -2.2%; 3.0 mg: -1.2% to -2.5%; and 4.5 mg: -1.2% to -3.2%). More patients randomized to 3.0 mg or 4.5 mg (vs. 1.5 mg) achieved HbA1c <7% at 36 weeks regardless of baseline HbA1c; the difference in proportions was greater at higher baseline HbA1c (P-interaction = 0.096). Similar patterns in glycaemic improvement and proportions achieving HbA1c <7% were observed at 52 weeks. Hypoglycaemia and gastrointestinal adverse events were similar among the HbA1c subgroups. Glycaemic control was improved with dulaglutide dose escalation from 1.5 mg to 3.0 mg or 4.5 mg across baseline HbA1c subgroups (<8%; 8.0% to < 9.0%; 9.0% to < 10%; and >= 10%).

Abstract
  AIM: To assess the efficacy and safety of insulin degludec/liraglutide (IDegLira) versus insulin degludec (degludec) in Chinese people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) treated with basal insulin.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: In DUAL II China, a randomized, double-blinded, multicentre, treat-to-target trial, Chinese adults with T2D and HbA1c of 7.5% or more on basal insulin and metformin, with or without other oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs), were randomized 2:1 to 26 weeks of treatment with either IDegLira (max. dose 50 U degludec/1.8 mg liraglutide) or degludec (max. 50 U/day), respectively, combined with metformin. At 26 weeks, superiority of IDegLira over degludec was assessed for change in HbA1c (primary endpoint), and body weight and number of severe or blood glucose (BG)-confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes (confirmatory secondary endpoints).

   RESULTS: Overall, 453 participants were randomized to IDegLira (n = 302) or degludec (n = 151). Superiority was confirmed for IDegLira over degludec in HbA1c change (-1.9% vs. -1.0%, respectively, estimated treatment difference [ETD] [95% confidence interval]: -0.92% [-1.09; -0.75], P < .0001), body weight change (-0.7 vs. +0.4 kg, respectively, ETD [95% CI]: -1.08 kg [-1.63; -0.52], P = .0002) and severe or BG-confirmed hypoglycaemia (estimated rate ratio [95% CI]: 0.53 [0.30; 0.94], P = .0297). The odds of achieving HbA1c less than 7.0% without hypoglycaemia and/or weight gain were greater with IDegLira than degludec (P < .0001 for all). Daily insulin dose at 26 weeks was lower for IDegLira (34.3 U) than degludec (37.4 U) (P = .0014). No unexpected safety signals were observed.

   CONCLUSIONS: IDegLira may be an efficacious and well-tolerated treatment intensification option for Chinese people with T2D uncontrolled on basal insulin and OADs. Copyright © 2021 The Authors. Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Abstract
  AIM: Preclinical data suggest that treatment with either glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 receptor agonists or dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-4 inhibitors could change the intestinal microbiome and thereby contribute to their beneficial (cardio)metabolic effects. Therefore, our study aimed to investigate the effects of these agents on microbiota composition in adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D).

   METHODS: A total of 51 adults with T2D (mean +/- SD: age 62.8 +/- 6.9 years, BMI 31.8 +/- 4.1 kg/m2, HbA1c 7.3 +/- 0.6%) treated with metformin and/or sulphonylureas were included in the 12-week randomized, double-blind trial. Patients were given the GLP-1 receptor agonist liraglutide (1.8 mg sc) or the DPP-4 inhibitor sitagliptin (100 mg), or matching placebos, once daily for 12 weeks. Faecal samples were collected at baseline and at 12 weeks after the start of the intervention. Microbiota analyses were performed by 16S rRNA gene-sequencing analysis. Bile acids were measured in faeces and plasma.

   RESULTS: Liraglutide decreased HbA1c by 1.3% (95% CI: -1.7 to -0.9) and tended to reduce body weight (-1.7 kg, 95% CI: -3.6 to 0.3), but increased faecal secondary bile acid deoxycholic acid. Sitagliptin lowered HbA1c by 0.8% (95% CI: -1.4 to -0.4) while body weight remained stable (-0.8 kg, 95% CI: -2.7 to 1.0), but increased faecal levels of cholic acid, chenodeoxycholic acid and ursodeoxycholic acid. However, neither liraglutide nor sitagliptin affected either alpha or beta diversity of the intestinal microbiota, nor were changes in microbial composition related to clinical parameters.

   CONCLUSION: These data suggest that the beneficial effects of liraglutide and sitagliptin on glucose metabolism, body weight and bile acids, when used as add-on therapies to metformin or sulphonylureas, are not linked to changes in the intestinal microbiota (NCT01744236).

Abstract
  We assessed whether comparative efficacy and safety of biphasic insulin aspart 30 (BIAsp 30) plus metformin versus BIAsp 30 monotherapy differed for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) inadequately controlled with oral antidiabetic drugs with different cardiovascular risk scores and different body mass indexes (BMI) by performing a post hoc analysis of the randomized controlled MERIT study. In the MERIT study, eligible patients were randomized 1:1 to receive BIAsp 30 plus metformin or BIAsp 30 for 16 weeks. Patients in the 2 treatment groups were classified into "low" and "high" risk subgroups based on their GloboRisk scores and into "BMI <= 26 kg/m2"and "BMI > 26 kg/m2" subgroups. Primary efficacy endpoint was between-treatments comparison of HbA1c changes from baseline for these 2 sets of subgroups. Between-treatments comparisons of secondary efficacy and safety endpoints were also performed. We found that BIAsp 30 plus metformin led to significantly higher percentage of high-risk patients achieving HbA1c target < 7% than BIAsp 30 monotherapy, with an overall comparable safety profile for high-risk patients. Meanwhile, for patients with BMI <= 26 kg/m2, compared with BIAsp 30 monotherapy, BIAsp 30 plus metformin led to significantly higher percentages of patients achieving HbA1c target (47.83% vs 28.17%, P = 0.0165) and composite target of HbA1c < 7% without hypoglycemia or weight gain (20.29% vs 6.85%, P = 0.0187) and have a slightly better safety profile. In conclusion, for T2DM patients at high CV risk or with BMI <= 26 kg/m2, BIAsp 30 plus metformin was preferable to BIAsp 30 monotherapy.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Policaptil Gel Retard R (PGR), is a new macromolecule complex based on polysaccharides slowing the rate of carbohydrate and fat absorption. It proved to significantly reduce body weight, acanthosis nigricans expression, HbA1c levels, and glucose metabolism abnormalities in obese, hyper-insulinemic adolescents. No such data are available for adults.

   AIM: to compare the effects of PGR vs. metformin in adult subjects with the Metabolic Syndrome (MS) and T2DM on a Low Glycemic Index diet.

   SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This spontaneous clinical, longitudinal, single-blind, randomized study based on a per-protocol analysis enrolled 100 outpatients with MS and T2DM consecutively referring to our clinic for three months, and randomly assigned to either the active treatment (Group A:, 6 tablets/day) or the comparator (Group B: Metformin tablets, 1500-2000 mg/day in two divided doses during the two main meals, to minimize side effects) to be taken 30 min before each main meal in equally divided doses. Serum lipid profile, anthropometry, HOMA-IR index, and tolerability parameters were evaluated before and after a 6-month follow-up period.

   RESULTS: all parameters improved at a similar rate in both groups but for the lipid profile, which got even better in Group A. Group A also experienced less prominent gastrointestinal side effects than its counterpart.

   CONCLUSION: For the first time, we showed the non-inferiority of PGR compared to metformin in obese adult subjects with the MS and T2DM as for glycemic control and a clear-cut superiority of PGR in terms of both serum lipid-lowering capacity and tolerability.

Abstract
  Metformin is considered a safe anti-hyperglycemic drug for patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D); however, information on its impact on heart failure-related outcomes remains inconclusive. The current systematic review explored evidence from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) reporting on the impact of metformin in modulating heart failure-related markers in patients with or without T2D. Electronic databases such as MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and EMBASE were searched for eligible studies. Included studies were those assessing the use of metformin as an intervention, and also containing the comparison group on placebo, and all articles had to report on measurable heart failure-related indices in individuals with or without T2D. The modified Downs and Black checklist was used to evaluate the risk of bias. Overall, nine studies met the inclusion criteria, enrolling a total of 2486 patients. Although summarized evidence showed that metformin did not affect left ventricular function, this antidiabetic drug could improve myocardial oxygen consumption concomitant to reducing prominent markers of heart failure such as n-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide and low-density lipoprotein levels, inconsistently between diabetic and nondiabetic patients. Effective modulation of some heart failure-related outcomes with metformin treatment was related to its beneficial effects in ameliorating insulin resistance and blocking pro-inflammatory markers such as the aging-associated cytokine CCL11 (C-C motif chemokine ligand 11). Overall, although such beneficial effects were observed with metformin treatment, additional RCTs are necessary to improve our understanding on its modulatory effects on heart failure-related outcomes especially in diabetic patients.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: While the Diabetes Prevention Program Study demonstrated that intensive lifestyle change and metformin both reduce type 2 diabetes incidence, there are little data on patient preferences in real-world, clinical settings.

   METHODS: The Prediabetes Informed Decisions and Education (PRIDE) study was a cluster-randomized trial of shared decision making (SDM) for diabetes prevention. In PRIDE, pharmacists engaged patients with prediabetes in SDM using a decision aid with information about both evidence-based options. We recorded which diabetes prevention option(s) participants chose after the SDM visit. We also evaluated logistic regression models examining predictors of choosing intensive lifestyle change +/- metformin, compared to metformin or usual care, and predictors of choosing metformin +/- intensive lifestyle change, compared to intensive lifestyle change or usual care.

   RESULTS: Among PRIDE participants (n = 515), 55% chose intensive lifestyle change, 8.5% chose metformin, 15% chose both options, and 21.6% declined both options. Women (odds ratio [OR] = 1.60, P = 0.023) had higher odds than men of choosing intensive lifestyle change. Patients >60 years old (OR = 0.50, P = 0.028) had lower odds than patients <50 years old of choosing metformin. Participants with higher body mass index (BMI) had higher odds of choosing intensive lifestyle change (OR = 1.07 per BMI unit increase, P = 0.005) v. other options and choosing metformin (OR = 1.06 per BMI unit increase, P = 0.008) v. other options.

   CONCLUSIONS: Patients with prediabetes are making choices for diabetes prevention that generally align with recommendations and expected benefits from the published literature. Our results are important for policy makers and clinicians, as well as program planners developing systemwide approaches for diabetes prevention.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To assess the long-term cost effectiveness of dapagliflozin (DAPA) and saxagliptin (SAXA) separately or together in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) inadequately controlled by metformin (MET).

   METHODS: Five head-to-head randomised controlled trials of the efficacy of DAPA and SAXA in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients were found by searching PubMed, Embase and Cochrane from inception to October 2019. The lifetime disease progression and long-term effectiveness of therapy in patients were projected by the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study Outcome Model 2 (UKPDS OM2) in three T2DM therapeutic groups: DAPA + SAXA, DAPA and SAXA. Each group used DAPA and/or SAXA as an add-on therapy to MET. The study took the perspective of Chinese healthcare service providers. Univariate, scenario and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed.

   RESULTS: The quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) value of the DAPA + SAXA, SAXA and DAPA groups were 11.28, 11.26 and 11.45 years, respectively. The total costs were US$27,954.84, US$23,254.46 and US$25,608.49, respectively. DAPA was dominant over DAPA + SAXA. The DAPA + SAXA group presented an estimated QALY gain of 0.02 and a total cost increase of US$4700.39 over the SAXA group, with an incremental cost of US$217,530.10 per QALY. Compared with the SAXA group, the DAPA group had a QALY gain of 0.19 years and a total cost increase of US$2354.04, for an incremental cost of US$12,191.97 per QALY. The pharmacoeconomic results were robust to univariate, scenario and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.

   CONCLUSIONS: Compared with DAPA + SAXA or SAXA, DAPA appears to be a cost-effective therapy as add-on to MET for Chinese patients whose T2DM is insufficiently controlled by MET.

Abstract
  Purpose: To determine the effect of Voglibose add-on therapy on daily glycemic excursions (using FreeStyle R Libre Pro TM, a Flash glucose monitoring system) in Indian patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) receiving a stable dose of metformin (Met) or metformin+sulfonylurea (Met+SU). Patients and Methods: T2DM patients with glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) >=7.0% and at least two postprandial excursions >=140 mg/dL (within 2 h of meal) during the screening phase (visit 1/day -14 +/- 2) were enrolled in this prospective, multicenter interventional study. The patients were randomized at visit 2 (day 0 +/- 2) to receive Voglibose 0.2 or 0.3 mg tablets (BID/TID) as add-on therapy to Met and Met+SU. All the patients were followed at day 14 +/- 2 (visit 3), month 3 +/- 14 days (visit 4), 14 weeks (i.e., visit 4 + 14 days) +/-2 days (visit 5), and month 6 +/- 14 days (visit 6). Continuous glucose monitoring was performed to study glycemic excursions at visits 2, 3, and 5. The study outcomes were: change in average number of glycemic excursions per day, percent time spent in glucose fluctuations, mean Postprandial glucose (PPG), Fasting plasma glucose (FPG), day and night time mean glucose levels from baseline to day 14 and week 14; change in mean amplitude of glycemic excursion (MAGE) from baseline to 14 weeks; and mean HbA1c level at 3 and 6 months. Results: Out of 110 patients enrolled, 101 patients (91.8%) (Met+SU+Voglibose: 73 and Met+Voglibose: 28) completed the study. There was a significant decrease in average number of glycemic excursions per day from baseline to day 14 in the Met+Sul+Voglibose group and to week 14 in the Met+Voglibose group. There was also a significant reduction in percent time spent above target glucose range from baseline to day 14 in both treatment groups and to week 14 in the Met+SU+Voglibose group. A significant reduction in mean PPG area under the curve, day and night time mean glucose levels, and mean FPG levels from baseline to day 14 was reported in both treatment groups. A significant reduction in night time glucose, and average MAGE and HbA1c levels was reported from baseline to week 14 in the Met+Voglibose group and the Met+SU+Voglibose group, respectively. At 6 months, body weight, glucose levels, cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, and HbA1c were significantly lower, especially in the Met+SU+Voglibose arm. Conclusion:  Voglibose was useful in reducing glycemic variability and improving glycemic control in Asian Indian adults with T2DM. (CTRI/2018/04/013074).

Abstract
  PURPOSE: In the Guidelines for the Prevention and Control of Type 2 Diabetes in China (2017 edition), intensive lifestyle interventions are recommended for preventing the progression of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) to type 2 diabetes mellitus. Acarbose and metformin can also be considered if intensive lifestyle modification has been ineffective for 6 months. But the effects of intensive lifestyle modification and glucose-lowering drug interventions that work best in the population with IGT are unclear. This network meta-analysis assessed the effectiveness of intensive lifestyle modification, acarbose, and metformin in treating populations with IGT.

   METHODS: We systematically searched both Chinese- and English-language databases, including China Knowledge, the Cochrane Library, Embase, PubMed, VIP, and Wanfang, for articles published between database inception and September 2019. Randomized, controlled clinical trials in patients with IGT treated with acarbose, metformin, and intensive lifestyle modification were assessed for eligibility. The data from all included studies were evaluated by 2 reviewers independently in accordance with the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Intervention version 6.0. A network meta-analysis was performed by using R software version 3.6.1.

   FINDINGS: The data from 53 randomized controlled trials were included in the review, with a sample size of 21,208 patients. Compared with the control group, the use of acarbose, metformin, and/or intensive lifestyle modification was associated with reduced rates of progression to diabetes (relative risks [RRs] [95% credible intervals]: acarbose, 0.37 [0.29-0.47]; metformin, 0.39 [0.30-0.50]; intensive lifestyle modification, 0.61 [0.50-0.73]). The surface under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA) value of acarbose was 88.35%, supporting that acarbose was more effective in reducing the rate of progression to diabetes compared with controls. With acarbose, metformin, and intensive lifestyle modification, the rates of achieving a normal glucose level were increased by RR = 2.1, 1.7, and 1.2, respectively when compared with control group. The SUCRA value of acarbose was 99.69%, supporting the optimal effect of acarbose in achieving a normal blood glucose level.

   IMPLICATIONS: In this meta-analysis in patients with IGT, compared with controls, acarbose and metformin were associated with decreased rates of progression to diabetes and increased rates of achieving a normal glucose level. Acarbose use was associated with an increased rate of achieving a normal glucose level, while intensive lifestyle modification was not. Copyright © 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Abstract
  AIMS: Although metformin has been reported to affect the gut microbiome, the mechanism has not been fully determined. We explained the potential underlying mechanisms of metformin through a multiomics approach.

   METHODS: An open-label and single-arm clinical trial involving 20 healthy Korean was conducted. Serum glucose and insulin concentrations were measured, and stool samples were collected to analyze the microbiome. Untargeted metabolomic profiling of plasma, urine, and stool samples was performed by GC-TOF-MS. Network analysis was applied to infer the mechanism of the hypoglycemic effect of metformin.

   RESULTS: The relative abundances of Escherichia, Romboutsia, Intestinibacter, and Clostridium were changed by metformin treatment. Additionally, the relative abundances of metabolites, including carbohydrates, amino acids, and fatty acids, were changed. These changes were correlated with energy metabolism, gluconeogenesis, and branched-chain amino acid metabolism, which are major metabolic pathways related to the hypoglycemic effect.

   CONCLUSIONS: We observed that specific changes in metabolites may affect hypoglycemic effects through both pathways related to AMPK activation and microbial changes. Energy metabolism was mainly related to hypoglycemic effects. In particular, branched-chain amino acid metabolism and gluconeogenesis were related to microbial metabolites. Our results will help uncover the potential underlying mechanisms of metformin through AMPK and the microbiome. Copyright © 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  AIM: To compare the efficacy and tolerability of metformin extended-release (MXR) and the conventional metformin immediate-release (MIR) formulations in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) METHODS: PubMed, the Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov and other sources were searched until 19 March 2021 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared equal daily doses of MXR and MIR in adults with T2DM. Random-effects model meta-analysis was performed to obtain pooled mean difference (MD) of change from baseline for continuous outcomes and risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes. Primary outcomes considered were HbA1c and key gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms (abdominal discomfort or pain, diarrhea, dyspepsia, and nausea & vomiting).

   RESULTS: Nine RCTs that randomized a total of 2609 adults revealed that MIR was statistically associated with better HbA1c lowering (MD 0.09% [95% confidence interval or CI, 0.01%, 0.17%]), MXR only reduced dyspepsia (RR 0.58 [95% CI, 0.34, 0.98]), and both formulations were associated with similar cumulative incidence of other key GI symptoms.

   CONCLUSIONS: MXR was associated with statistically worse but likely clinically similar HbA1c lowering and minimal improvement of GI intolerance compared to MIR. Protocol Registration: PROSPERO (CRD42019148008). Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  AIMS: To compare OGTT-derived estimates of beta-cell function between youth and adults with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes after treatment discontinuation in RISE.

   METHODS: Youth (n = 89) and adults (n = 132) were randomized to 3 months glargine followed by 9 months metformin (G/M) or 12 months metformin (MET). Insulin sensitivity and beta-cell responses were estimated from 3-hour OGTTs over 21 months. Linear mixed models tested for differences by time and age group within each treatment arm.

   RESULTS: After treatment withdrawal, HbA1c increased in both youth and adults with a larger net increase in G/M youth vs. adults at 21 months. Among youth, beta-cell function decreased starting at 12 months in G/M and 15 months in MET. Among adults, beta-cell function remained relatively stable although insulin secretion rates decreased in G/M at 21 months. At 21 months vs. baseline beta-cell function declined to a greater extent in youth vs. adults in both the G/M and MET treatment arms.

   CONCLUSIONS: After treatment withdrawal youth demonstrated progressive decline in beta-cell function after stopping treatment with either G/M or MET. In contrast, beta-cell function in adults remained stable despite an increase in HbA1c over time. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01779375 and NCT01779362 at clinical trials.gov.

Abstract
  AIMS: GLP-1RA has many beneficial properties, including anti-inflammatory, anti-obesogenic, pulmonary protective effects as well as beneficial impact on gut microbiome. However, the evidence regarding the benefit of GLP-1RA in Covid-19 patients with diabetes is still unclear. This study sought to analyze the benefit of pre-admission use of GLP-1RA in altering the mortality outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) patients with diabetes mellitus.

   METHODS: Using specific keywords, we comprehensively searched the potential articles on PubMed, Europe PMC, and medRxiv database until June 12th, 2021. All published studies on Covid-19 and GLP-1RA were retrieved. Statistical analysis was conducted using Review Manager 5.4 and Comprehensive Meta-Analysis version 3 software.

   RESULTS: A total of 9 studies with 19,660 diabetes mellitus patients who were infected by SARS-CoV-2 were included in the meta-analysis. Our data suggested that pre-admission use of GLP-1RA was associated with reduction in mortality rate from Covid-19 in patients with diabetes mellitus (OR 0.53; 95 %CI: 0.43-0.66, p < 0.00001, I2 = 0%, random-effect modelling). Further analysis showed that the associations were not influenced by age (p = 0.213), gender (p = 0.421), hypertension (p = 0.131), cardiovascular disease (p = 0.293), nor the use of metformin (p = 0.189) and insulin (p = 0.117).

   CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that pre-admission use of GLP-1RA may offer beneficial effects on Covid-19 mortality in patients with diabetes mellitus. However, more randomized clinical trials are required to confirm this conclusion. Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  AIMS: Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) share pathophysiological mechanisms and possible therapeutic strategies. We evaluated the effects of 1-year treatment with pioglitazone or sulphonylureas on indirect indices of NAFLD in people with T2D and the role of insulin-resistance and glucotoxicity in determining these effects.

   METHODS: Patients with T2D (n = 195) aged 50-75 years, poorly controlled with metformin 2 g/day, were randomly allocated to add-on pioglitazone (n = 98) or sulphonylureas (n = 97) within the TOSCA.IT trial. Plasma insulin, glucose, and liver enzymes were measured at baseline and after 1-year. Indirect indices of NAFLD (Liver Fat Equation [LFE], Hepatic Steatosis Index [HSI], and Index of NASH [ION]), and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR, Visceral Adiposity Index [VAI] and adipose tissue Insulin Resistance [ADIPO-IR]) were calculated.

   RESULTS: Indices of NAFLD improved after pioglitazone, but not after sulphonylureas; differences between changes (1-year minus baseline) were respectively: -1.76 +/- 3.84 vs. 0.28 +/- 3.75 for LFE; -1.35 +/- 2.78 vs. -0.27 +/- 2.63 for HSI; -9.75 +/- 43 vs. 3.24 +/- 31 for ION; p < 0.05 for all. Indices of insulin resistance decreased after pioglitazone, but not after sulphonylureas: -0.95 +/- 4.57 vs. 0.37 +/- 3.34 for HOMA-IR, p = 0.032; -1.25 +/- 4.11 vs. 1.36 +/- 5.43 for ADIPO-IR, p = 0.001; -0.53 +/- 1.88 vs. 0.03 +/- 2.36 for VAI, p = 0.074. Changes in NAFLD indices were similar with different doses of pioglitazone (15, 30, or 45 mg/day), and were independent of blood glucose control.

   CONCLUSIONS: One-year treatment with pioglitazone even at low dosage significantly improved liver steatosis and inflammation, systemic and adipose tissue insulin resistance in patients with T2D. The beneficial effects of pioglitazone on NAFLD were independent of blood glucose control. Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  AIM OF THE STUDY: Metformin is recommended as the first-line treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Despite its common use, few studies have been conducted to precisely measure the efficacy of metformin versus placebo as a first-line treatment. This study aims to assess the precise effects of metformin monotherapy on glycemic control and weight in drug-naive patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

   METHODS: Medline R and Cochrane databases were searched until March 19, 2016 to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of placebo-controlled randomized trials evaluating metformin monotherapy in drug-naive patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Assessed outcomes include glycemic control (fasting plasma glucose, glycosated hemoglobin) and weight.

   RESULTS: Overall, 16 studies (1140 patients) were selected. Compared to placebo, metformin monotherapy was associated with decreased glycosated hemoglobin by 0.95% at 3 months (95% CI: 0.50 to 1.39, I2=87%) and 1.32% at 6 months (95% CI: 1.01 to 1.62, I2=71%), and decreased fasting plasma glucose by 1.92mmol/L at 1 month (95% CI: 0.11 to 3.74, I2=88%), 1.79mmol/L at 3 months (95% CI: 0.92 to 2.66, I2=88%) and 2.14mmol/L at 6 months (95% CI: 1.17 to 3.12, I2=82%). No significant difference was demonstrated for the comparisons of weight due to relatively small number of studies retrieved from the literature resulting in insufficient statistical power.

   CONCLUSION: This study provides the precise effects of metformin monotherapy regarding the decreases in fasting plasma glucose and glycosated hemoglobin that physician can expected in drug-naive patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. No evidence was found for the effects on weight. Copyright © 2018 Societe francaise de pharmacologie et de therapeutique. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  AIMS: To determine the early benefit:risk balance of dulaglutide versus insulin glargine in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

   METHODS: This post hoc analysis used data from a randomized, open-label study (AWARD-2; modified intention-to-treat group) in which suboptimally controlled metformin+glimepiride-treated patients received dulaglutide 1.5mg (n=273) or insulin glargine (n=262). Two composite endpoints were used: for weeks 2-20, fasting serum glucose (FSG) <130mg/dL (<7.2mmol/L) without hypoglycemia (blood glucose <=70mg/dL [<=3.9mmol/L] or severe hypoglycemia); at week 26, patients with glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) <7.0% (<53.0mmol/mol) or reduction from baseline >=1.0% (>=10.9mmol/mol), no hypoglycemia (as defined above) and no weight gain. Odds ratios (ORs) were generated using logistic regression analysis.

   RESULTS: The probability of reaching the FSG target without hypoglycemia was higher with dulaglutide than with insulin glargine at weeks 4 (OR 1.78; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.22-2.60) and 8 (OR 1.69; 95% CI 1.15-2.48). The proportion of patients achieving the 26-week endpoint was higher with dulaglutide (37.4% vs. 10.3%; OR 5.28; 95% CI 3.28-8.48).

   CONCLUSIONS: Dulaglutide's balanced efficacy-to-safety profile compares favorably with that of insulin glargine and is apparent soon after treatment initiation and after 6months of therapy. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Weight loss in children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes (T2D) is associated with improved glycaemic control.

   OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of liraglutide vs placebo on body mass index (BMI) and weight parameters in children and adolescents with T2D using data from the ellipse trial (NCT01541215).

   METHODS: The ellipse trial randomized participants (10-<17 years old, BMI >85th percentile, T2D, glycated haemoglobin [HbA1c ] 7.0%-11.0% [if diet- and exercise-treated] or 6.5% to 11.0% [if treated with metformin, basal insulin or both]) to liraglutide or placebo. This post-hoc analysis evaluated changes from baseline to weeks 26 and 52 in absolute BMI, percent change in BMI and other weight-related parameters. Changes were assessed by liraglutide overall (all doses) and liraglutide by dose (0.6, 1.2 and 1.8 mg/day) vs placebo using a pattern mixture model of observed data, with missing observations imputed from each treatment group.

   RESULTS: In total, 134 participants were included. There were statistically significant differences between groups in certain parameters, including absolute BMI (estimated treatment difference [ETD] -0.89 kg/m2 ; 95% confidence interval [CI] -1.71,-0.06) and percent change in BMI (ETD -2.73%; 95% CI -5.15,-0.30) at week 52, but none at week 26. Dose-dependent effects were not observed for liraglutide vs placebo for all BMI/weight parameters.

   CONCLUSIONS: Compared with placebo, liraglutide was associated with statistically significant reductions in BMI/weight parameters at week 52, but not week 26, in children and adolescents with T2D. Copyright © 2021 World Obesity Federation.

Abstract
  Oral semaglutide (Rybelsus R) is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) with 94% homology to human GLP-1. It is the first GLP-1RA developed for oral administration, and it comprises a co-formulation of the peptide semaglutide with the absorption enhancer sodium N-(8-[2-hydroxybenzoyl] amino) caprylate, which overcomes the challenges of peptide absorption in the acidic conditions of the stomach. Oral semaglutide is indicated for use as an add-on combination therapy (with other glucose-lowering agents, including insulin) or as a monotherapy (in patients who are intolerant to metformin) for type 2 diabetes when diet and exercise do not provide adequate glycemic control. In an extensive phase III clinical program including patients from across the disease spectrum, treatment with oral semaglutide resulted in effective glycemic control, reductions in body weight, and decreases in systolic blood pressure when used as monotherapy or in combination with other glucose-lowering therapies. Studies showed that oral semaglutide was well tolerated, with a safety profile consistent with the GLP-1RA drug class. The risk of hypoglycemia was low, and the most common adverse events were gastrointestinal, with nausea and diarrhea generally being the most frequently reported manifestations. Cardiovascular (CV) safety was shown to be noninferior to placebo and observations suggest that the CV profile of oral semaglutide is likely to be similar to that of subcutaneous semaglutide. The evolution of the GLP-1RA class to include an oral agent could facilitate the use of these agents earlier in the diabetes treatment cascade owing to wider acceptance from patients and healthcare professionals.

Abstract
  Clinical trials investigating cardiovascular safety of dipeptidyl peptidase-IV inhibitors (DPP-4i) among patients with cardiovascular and renal disease rarely recruit patients with renal impairment, despite associations with increased risk for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). We investigated the risk of MACE associated with the use of DPP-4i among these high-risk patients. Using a new-user, retrospective, cohort design, we analyzed 2010-2015 IBM MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters for patients with diabetes, comorbid with cardiovascular disease and/or renal impairment. We compared time to first MACE for DPP-4i versus sulfonylurea and versus metformin. Of 113,296 individuals, 9146 (8.07%) were new DPP-4i users, 17,481 (15.43%) were new sulfonylurea users, and 88,596 (78.20%) were new metformin users. Exposure groups were not mutually exclusive. DPP-4i was associated with lower risk for MACE than sulfonylurea (aHR 0.84; 95% CI 0.74, 0.93) and similar risk for MACE to metformin (aHR 1.07; 95% CI [1.04, 1.16]). DPP-4i use was associated with lower risk for MACE compared to sulfonylureas and similar risk for MACE compared to metformin. This association was most evident in the first year of therapy, suggesting that DPP-4i is a safer choice than sulfonylurea for diabetes treatment initiation in high-risk patients. Copyright © 2021.

Abstract
  Metformin is a widely used glucose-lowering drug, although its impact on adipose tissue function remains elusive. Adipose tissue-derived molecules regulate diverse physiological mechanisms, including energy metabolism, insulin sensitization, and inflammatory response. Alternatively, it has remained relevant to understand the therapeutic regulation of adipokines in efforts to alleviate inflammation in conditions associated with the metabolic syndrome. The current qualitative analysis of available literature focused on randomized clinical trials (RCTs) assessing the association between administration of metformin and adipokine regulation in individuals with metabolic syndrome. The major electronic databases such as MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and EMBASE were searched for eligible RCTs. Overall, 13 RCTs met the inclusion criteria, with a total of 4605 participants. Patients with metabolic syndrome were characterized by a state of obesity, impaired glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes. Cumulative evidence from these RCTs supported the blood glucose lowering effects of metformin, in addition to promoting weight loss, ameliorating insulin resistance, and reducing pro-inflammatory markers such as interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in patients with metabolic syndrome. Importantly, these therapeutic effects are associated with the upregulation of adiponectin and suppression of leptin and resistin. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  Using the data from the trial of Metformin and AcaRbose in Chinese as the initial Hypoglycemic treatment (MARCH), this study was performed to compare the differential effects of acarbose and metformin on glucose metabolism after stratification by gender. Six hundred and forty patients who had finished the whole 48-week follow-up were included. The reduction of haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was comparable between acarbose- and metformin-treated patients among either females or males, and it was also similar between males and females treated with either acarbose or metformin for 24 and 48 weeks. The dropping of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) in acarbose-treated females was significantly less than that in metformin-treated females at both 24 and 48 weeks. Furthermore, the decrease of 2-hour postprandial glucose (2hPPG) in acarbose-treated males was significantly greater than that in metformin-treated males at both 24 and 48 weeks. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that drug selection was an independent factor affecting the decrease of FPG in female patients while it independently influenced 2hPPG in males at week 24 and 48. The reductions of FPG and 2hPPG at week 24 and 48 were also significantly different between metformin-treated females and metformin-treated males although gender was not an independent regulating factor. Our study indicates that there might be gender-differential effects on FPG and 2hPPG reduction when the comparisons are made between acarbose and metformin treatments.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) prevent hospitalization resulting from heart failure (HHF). However, patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus use multiple antihyperglycemic drugs to achieve glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) targets. In these drug combinations, the risk of HHF is unpredictable and so is the parallel effect of glucose-lowering.

   PURPOSE: To examine the impact of antihyperglycemic drugs and their association on HHF.

   DATA SOURCES: Forty randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reporting HHF.

   STUDY SELECTION: Published RCTs were the data source.

   DATA EXTRACTION: Incidence rates of HHF.

   DATA SYNTHESIS: Random additive-effects network meta-analysis showed that metformin (P = 0.55), sulfonylureas (P = 0.51), glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor-agonist (P = 0.16), and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP4is; P = 0.54) were neutral on the risk of HHF. SGLT2is and SGLT2is + DPP4is reduced the risk of HHF with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.68 (95% CI, 0.60-0.76; P < 0.0001) and 0.70 (95% CI, 0.60-0.81; P < 0.0001), respectively. Increased risk of HHF was associated with thiazolidinediones (TZDs) as monotherapy or in combination with DPP4is (HR: 1.45; 95% CI, 1.18-1.78; P = 0.0004) and 1.49 (95% CI, 1.18-1.88; P = 0.0008), respectively. Regardless of the therapy, a 1% reduction in HbA1c reduced the risk of HHF by 31.3% (95% CI, 9-48; P = 0.009).

   LIMITATIONS: There are no data to verify drug combinations available for clinical use and to discriminate the effect of drugs within each of the therapeutic classes.

   CONCLUSIONS: The risk of HHF is reduced by SGLT2is as monotherapy or in combination with DPP4is and increased by TZDs as monotherapy or in combination. Glucose-lowering provides an additive effect of reducing HHF. Copyright © The Author(s) 2021. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Endocrine Society. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  AIMS: To investigate measures of carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) and conventional cardiovascular (CV) risk factors as predictors of future carotid IMT, and the prediction of CV events during follow-up based on measures of carotid IMT.

   METHODS: Observational longitudinal study including 230 persons with type 2 diabetes (T2D).

   RESULTS: Mean age at follow-up was 66.7 (SD 8.5) years, 30.5% were women and mean body mass index (BMI) was 31.8 (4.4) kg/m2. Carotid IMT was measured at baseline, after 18months of intervention in the Copenhagen Insulin and Metformin Therapy (CIMT) trial and after a mean follow-up of 6.4 (1.0) years. Baseline carotid IMT, carotid IMT after 18months' intervention, and CV risk factors (age, sex and baseline systolic blood pressure) gave the best prediction of carotid IMT (root mean-squared error of prediction of 0.106 and 95% prediction error probability interval of -0.160, 0.204).

   CONCLUSIONS: Measures of carotid IMT combined with CV risk factors at baseline predicts attained carotid IMT better than measures of carotid IMT or CV risk factors alone. Carotid IMT did not predict CV events, and the present results do not support the use of carotid IMT as a predictor of CV events in persons with T2D. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: Cotadutide, a dual GLP-1 and glucagon receptor agonist, is under development for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and chronic kidney disease with type 2 diabetes. The effects of cotadutide on hepatic and metabolic parameters were evaluated in participants with overweight/obesity and type 2 diabetes.

   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this phase 2b study, 834 adults with BMI >=25 kg/m2 and type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin (glycated hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c] of 7.0%-10.5% [53-91 mmol/mol]) were randomized to double-blind cotadutide 100 mug (n = 100), 200 mug (n = 256), or 300 mug (n = 256); placebo (n = 110); or open-label liraglutide 1.8 mg (n = 110)-all administered subcutaneously. Coprimary end points were changes in HbA1c and body weight at week 14. The originally randomized interventions were continued to week 54. Liver damage biomarkers and liver fibrosis algorithms were assessed.

   RESULTS: Cotadutide significantly decreased HbA1c and body weight at weeks 14 and 54 versus placebo (all P < 0.001). Improvements in lipid profile, AST and ALT levels, propeptide of type III collagen level, fibrosis-4 index, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease fibrosis score were observed with cotadutide 300 mug versus placebo, but not with liraglutide. Weight loss with cotadutide 200 mug was similar to that with liraglutide 1.8 mg and greater with cotadutide 300 mug versus liraglutide 1.8 mg. The most common adverse events with cotadutide (nausea, 35%; vomiting, 17%) decreased over time.

   CONCLUSIONS: Cotadutide treatment for 54 weeks improved glycemic control and weight loss in participants with overweight/obesity and type 2 diabetes. Ad hoc analyses demonstrated improvements in hepatic parameters and support further evaluation of cotadutide in NASH. Copyright © 2021 by the American Diabetes Association.

Abstract
  AIMS: Metformin exerts anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects. We addressed the impact of prior metformin use on prognosis in patients with type 2 diabetes hospitalised for COVID-19.

   METHODS: CORONADO is a nationwide observational study that included patients with diabetes hospitalised for COVID-19 between March 10 and April 10, 2020 in 68 French centres. The primary outcome combined tracheal intubation and/or death within 7 days of admission. A Kaplan-Meier survival curve was reported for death up to day 28. The association between metformin use and outcomes was then estimated in a logistic regression analysis after applying a propensity score inverse probability of treatment weighting approach.

   RESULTS: Among the 2449 patients included, 1496 were metformin users and 953 were not. Compared with non-users, metformin users were younger with a lower prevalence of diabetic complications, but had more severe features of COVID-19 on admission. The primary endpoint occurred in 28.0% of metformin users (vs 29.0% in non-users, P = 0.6134) on day 7 and in 32.6% (vs 38.7%, P = 0.0023) on day 28. The mortality rate was lower in metformin users on day 7 (8.2 vs 16.1%, P < 0.0001) and on day 28 (16.0 vs 28.6%, P < 0.0001). After propensity score weighting was applied, the odds ratios for primary outcome and death (OR [95%CI], metformin users vs non-users) were 0.838 [0.649-1.082] and 0.688 [0.470-1.007] on day 7, then 0.783 [0.615-0.996] and 0.710 [0.537-0.938] on day 28, respectively.

   CONCLUSION: Metformin use appeared to be associated with a lower risk of death in patients with diabetes hospitalised for COVID-19. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  The global incidence and prevalence of type 2 diabetes have been escalating in recent decades. The total diabetic population is expected to increase from 415 million in 2015 to 642 million by 2040. Patients with type 2 diabetes have an increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). About two-thirds of patients with type 2 diabetes died of ASCVD. The association between hyperglycemia and elevated cardiovascular (CV) risk has been demonstrated in multiple cohort studies. However, clinical trials of intensive glucose reduction by conventional antidiabetic agents did not significantly reduce macrovascular outcomes. In December 2008, U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a mandate that every new antidiabetic agent requires rigorous assessments of its CV safety. Thereafter, more than 200,000 patients have been enrolled in a number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). These trials were initially designed to prove noninferiority. It turned out that some of these trials demonstrated superiority of some new antidiabetic agents versus placebo in reducing CV endpoints, including macrovascular events, renal events, and heart failure. These results are important in clinical practice and also provide an opportunity for academic society to formulate treatment guidelines or consensus to provide specific recommendations for glucose control in various CV diseases. In 2018, the Taiwan Society of Cardiology (TSOC) and the Diabetes Association of Republic of China (DAROC) published the first joint consensus on the "Pharmacological Management of Patients with Type 2 Diabetes and Cardiovascular Diseases." In 2020, TSOC appointed a new consensus group to revise the previous version. The updated 2020 consensus was comprised of 5 major parts: (1) treatment of diabetes in patients with multiple risk factors, (2) treatment of diabetes in patients with coronary heart disease, (3) treatment of diabetes in patients with stage 3 chronic kidney disease, (4) treatment of diabetes in patients with a history of stroke, and (5) treatment of diabetes in patients with heart failure. The members of the consensus group thoroughly reviewed all the evidence, mainly RCTs, and also included meta-analyses and real-world evidence. The treatment targets of HbA1c were finalized. The antidiabetic agents were ranked according to their clinical evidence. The consensus is not mandatory. The final decision may need to be individualized and based on clinicians' discretion.

Abstract
  In the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcome Study (DPPOS), a cohort at high risk of diabetes, randomization to intensive lifestyle intervention or metformin, both associated with weight loss, did not have long-term negative effects on BMD compared with the placebo group. Potential positive effects of metformin on bone warrant further investigation.

   INTRODUCTION: Randomization to lifestyle intervention (ILS) or metformin in the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) resulted in weight loss and reduced progression to diabetes. Weight loss is associated with reduced bone mineral density (BMD), but the long-term effects of these interventions on BMD are unknown. In the DPP Outcome Study (DPPOS), we determined if randomization to ILS or metformin, compared with placebo, was associated with differences in BMD approximately 16 years later.

   METHODS: Of 3234 DPP participants, 2779 continued in DPPOS and were offered ILS in group format. Those randomized to metformin were offered unmasked metformin. At DPPOS year 12, 1367 participants had dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scans. BMD in metformin and ILS groups was compared to placebo using sex-specific linear regression models, adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, and weight and weight-bearing activity at DPP baseline.

   RESULTS: At DPPOS year 12, mean age was 66.5 (+/-9.5) years. Femoral neck BMD was similar in the ILS and placebo groups in men (difference = -0.021 g/cm2, 95%CI (-0.063, 0.021)) and in women (+0.014 g/cm2, 95%CI (-0.014, 0.042)). Femoral neck BMD was higher in the metformin compared to placebo group although not statistically different in men (+0.017 g/cm2, 95% CI (-0.023, 0.058)) and in women (+0.019 g/cm2, 95% CI (-0.009, 0.047)). Prevalence of osteoporosis was low and similar across treatment groups in men (0.9%; p=0.745) and women (2.4%; p=0.466).

   CONCLUSION: In a cohort at high risk of diabetes, lifestyle intervention or metformin did not appear to have long-term negative effects on BMD. Potential positive effects of metformin on bone warrant further research. Copyright © 2021. International Osteoporosis Foundation and National Osteoporosis Foundation.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: An increasing number of older patients has type 2 diabetes treated with different oral antidiabetic agents whose safety may raise concern considering some particularities of a heterogeneous elderly population.

   AREAS COVERED: This article discusses some characteristics of older patients that could increase the risk of adverse events, with a focus on hypoglycemia. It describes the most frequent and/or severe complications reported in the elderly in both randomized controlled trials and observational studies with metformin, sulfonylureas, meglitinides, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, thiazolidinediones, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (gliptins) and sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 inhibitors (gliflozins).

   EXPERT OPINION: Old patients may present comorbidities (renal impairment, vascular disease, heart failure, risk of dehydration, osteoporosis, cognitive dysfunction) that could increase the risk of severe adverse events. Sulfonylureas (and meglitinides) induce hypoglycemia, which may be associated with falls/fractures and cardiovascular events. Medications lacking hypoglycemia should be preferred. Gliptins appear to have the best tolerance/safety profile whereas gliflozins exert a cardiorenal protection. However, data are lacking in very old or frailty old patients so that caution and appropriate supervision of such patients are required. Taking advantage of a large choice of pharmacotherapies, personalized treatment is recommended based upon both drug safety profiles and old patient individual characteristics.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: As sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) are second-line treatment options in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), our study sought to provide precise effect estimates regarding the role of GLP-1RAs vs SGLT-2is as add-on treatments in patients uncontrolled by metformin monotherapy.

   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: PubMed, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and 'grey literature' were searched from their inception up to December 2019 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with durations>=12weeks to evaluate the safety and efficacy of adding a GLP-1RA vs an SGLT-2i in patients with T2DM.

   RESULTS: Three eligible RCTs were identified. Administration of GLP-1RAs vs SGLT-2is resulted in significant decreases in HbA1c with no significant impact on either body weight or fasting plasma glucose. GLP-1RA treatment led to a significant increase in odds for achieving an HbA1c<7% compared with SGLT-2is, whereas no difference was detected in body weight reductions of>5%. Significantly greater risk for any hypoglycaemia, nausea and diarrhoea, and lower risk for genital infections, was also observed with GLP-1RAs, while no differences regarding severe hypoglycaemia, treatment discontinuation and impact on blood pressure levels were identified. No other major safety issues arose.

   CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis suggests that GLP-1RAs provide better glycaemic effects than SGLT-2is in patients with T2DM uncontrolled by metformin, albeit while increasing risk for hypoglycaemia and gastrointestinal adverse events. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  AIM: There are no approved drugs for the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, many randomized controlled trials (RCT) have examined the effect of anti-hyperglycaemic agents on NAFLD in patients with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), since both T2DM and insulin resistance are closely linked to this burdensome liver disease.

   METHODS: We systematically searched publication databases using predefined keywords to identify head-to-head or placebo-controlled RCTs (published until September 30, 2019) of NAFLD individuals testing the efficacy of anti-hyperglycaemic drugs to specifically treat NAFLD or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Outcomes of interest included changes in serum liver enzyme levels, liver fat, liver fibrosis, or histologic resolution of NASH.

   RESULTS: We included 29 RCTs involving a total of 2,617 individuals (~45% had T2DM) that have used metformin (n=6 studies), glitazones (n=8 studies), glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (n=6 studies), dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (n=4 studies) or sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (n=7 studies) to treat NAFLD. Although most anti-hyperglycaemic drugs improved serum liver enzyme levels, only glitazones (especially pioglitazone) and liraglutide showed an improvement of histologic features of NAFLD, with a mild beneficial effect also on liver fibrosis for pioglitazone only.

   CONCLUSION: RCT evidence supports the efficacy of some anti-hyperglycaemic agents (especially pioglitazone) in patients with NAFLD or NASH, though weight gain with pioglitazone may warrant caution. Further well-designed RCTs are needed to better characterize the efficacy and safety of monotherapy and combination therapy with anti-hyperglycaemic agents in patients with NAFLD.

Abstract
  AIM: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of iGlarLixi in Mexican patients with type 2 diabetes who participated in the LixiLan clinical trials and compare results with the rest of the patients.

   METHODS: Data was collected for Mexican patients who participated in either of three studies: phase 2 trial LixiLan-POC, that compared iGlarLixi vs insulin glargine (iGlar) on inadequately controlled patients with metformin; phase 3 trial LixiLan-O, comparing iGlarLixi vs iGlar and lixisenatide on inadequately controlled patients with oral antidiabetic agents; and finally the phase 3 trial LixiLan-L, comparing iGlarLixi vs iGlar on inadequately controlled patients with basal insulin. The primary endpoint was the change in HbA1c from baseline to end of treatment.

   RESULTS: In the Mexican population, treatment with iGlarLixi significantly improved HbA1c compared with each component alone achieving an average of 6.5%; (6.17%, 6.63% and 6.73% for the LixiLan-POC, O and L studies respectively) and an average HbA1c reduction from baseline of 1.6%, for the three studies at end of treatment period.

   CONCLUSION: The efficacy and safety profile of iGlarLixi demonstrate a fair or better composite endpoint of HbA1c without hypoglycemia and no weight gain compared to overall trial population, which could help improve Mexican patients' outcomes. Copyright © 2019. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Diabetic subjects are at increased risk of subtle cognitive impairment since the disease early stages and of dementia later in life. In animal models, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonizts (GLP1-RAs) have been shown to exert neuroprotective effects, expecially in the memory domain. We assessed whether treatment with a GLP1-RA might affect cognitive functions in type 2 diabetic subjects independently on the weight loss it might induce.

   SUBJECTS/METHODS: Forty metformin-treated obese subjects with prediabetes or newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus, received liraglutide (1.8 mg/d) (n = 20) or lifestyle counseling (dietary intervention and exercise training) (n = 20) until achieving a modest and comparable weight loss (-7% of initial body weight).

   INTERVENTIONS/METHODS: A detailed neuropsychological assessment before and after weight loss was completed in 16 patients per arm, who were administered a total of seven psychological tests, thus assessing three composite domain z-scores for attention, memory, and executive control.

   RESULTS: After comparable weight loss and superimposable glycemic control and insulin sensitivity, a significant increase in short term memory (mean Digit Span Z score from -0.06 to 0.80, p = 0.024) and memory composite z-score (mean memory z-score from -0.67 to 0.032, p = 0.0065) was observed in the liraglutide exposed subjects (between group p = 0.041 and p = 0.033, respectively).

   CONCLUSIONS: Liraglutide might slow down memory function decline in diabetic patients in early, and possibly preclinical stages of the disease.

Abstract
  Metformin is the first-line antidiabetic drug that is widely used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Even though the various therapeutic potential of metformin treatment has been reported, as well as the improvement of insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis, the mechanisms underlying those benefits are still not fully understood. In order to explain the beneficial effects on metformin treatment, various metabolomics analyses have been applied to investigate the metabolic alterations in response to metformin treatment, and significant systemic metabolome changes were observed in biofluid, tissues, and cells. In this review, we compare the latest metabolomic research including clinical trials, animal models, and in vitro studies comprehensively to understand the overall changes of metabolome on metformin treatment.

Abstract
  PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To review the current evidence for the use of metformin in pregnancy for women with type 2 diabetes.

   RECENT FINDINGS: A large, multicenter, double-blind randomized controlled trial found that women with type 2 diabetes in pregnancy treated with metformin as an adjunct to insulin therapy had less gestational weight gain, insulin requirements, caesarian sections, macrosomia, and neonatal adiposity, but more neonates were small for gestational age (SGA) compared with insulin alone. It is unclear if the higher number of SGA infants are a direct result of metformin exposure or mediated through other effects such as less gestational weight gain and improved glycemic control. Additional follow-up studies of offspring exposed to metformin in utero are required. Metformin may be a useful adjunctive treatment for women with type 2 diabetes in pregnancy to help meet glycemic targets if there are no concerns for or indications of SGA. Copyright © 2021.

Abstract
  Background Patients with hypertension and diabetes mellitus are susceptible to dementia, but regular therapy fails to reduce the risk of dementia. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists have neuroprotective effects in experimental studies. We aimed to assess the effect of liraglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, on cognitive function and whether its effect was associated with metabolic changes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Methods and Results Fifty patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were recruited in this prospective study. All patients underwent cognitive assessment and brain activation monitoring by functional near-infrared spectroscopy. At 12 weeks, patients in the glucagon-like peptide-1 group acquired better scores in all cognitive tests and showed remarkable improvement in memory and attention (P=0.040) test compared with the control group after multivariable adjustment. Compared with the control group, liraglutide significantly increased activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and orbitofrontal cortex brain regions (P=0.0038). After liraglutide treatment, cognitive scores were significantly correlated with changes in these activating brain regions (P<0.05), but no correlation was observed between the changes in cognitive function and changes of body mass index, blood pressure, and glycemic levels. Conclusions We concluded that liraglutide improves cognitive decline in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. This beneficial effect is independent of its hypoglycemic effect and weight loss. The optimal intervention should be targeted to cognitive decline in the early stages of dementia. Registration URL: https://www.ClinicalTrials.gov; Unique identifier: NCT03707171.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: The prevalence of T2DM is steadily increasing not only among the elderly, but also at a young age. T2DM is preceded by a long period of significant metabolic changes with the development of insulin resistance and B-cell dysfunction. To reduce the prevalence of complications, treatment is needed which affects several pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the disease. Monotherapy with metformin at the onset of T2DM is often insufficient. The VERIFY study demonstrated the advantage of early administration of a combination of vildagliptin and metformin in relation to the glycemic durability compared to the sequential intensification of metformin with vildagliptin in patients with type 2 diabetes.

   AIMS: To assess the current situation in terms of the incidence of T2DM complications and the structure of the prescribing glucose lowering drugs based on the data from the Diabetes Register (DR) of the Moscow Region. To demonstrate the advantages of early combination therapy in patients with newly diagnosed T2DM using clinical cases.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: The data from the DR of the Moscow region, which is part of the National Diabetes Register of the Russian Federation, were used for the analysis. The data of 6,096 patients with T2DM who died in 2019 were evaluated for building the structure of the causes of death of patients with T2DM. The pattern of glucose-lowering therapy was analyzed based on data of 226,327 patients with T2DM (for 2020), as well as separately of 14,379 patients with newly diagnosed T2DM in 2019. Clinical cases are described based on the data of two patients with T2DM, available in the DR database and outpatient records.

   RESULTS: In patients with young onset T2DM (<40 years), the prevalence of severe complications is higher than in the general population of patients with T2DM: blindness is in 5.9 times, end-stage chronic renal failure in 2.9 times, lower limb amputations in 6.4 times more. When prescribing glucose lowering drugs, monotherapy is prevalent, mostly metformin. In double combination, metformin is used in 96.22% of cases. In the structure of glucose lowering drugs, with newly diagnosed T2DM, combination therapy is used less frequently than in patients with T2DM in general. Of the drugs of the IDP-4 group, vildagliptin is most often prescribed - 46.25% (including of a fixed combination with metformin - 12.22%). Clinical cases reflect a rapid clinical outcome: a decrease in HbA1c to the target in 6 months, the absence of hypoglycemia or other side effects, and positive weight dynamics.

   CONCLUSIONS: A fairly large propotion of patients with T2DM are on monotherapy with glucouse lowering drugs. Early prescription of the combination of metformin plus vildagliptin provides a longer maintenance of glycemic control without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia and weight gain for patients with newly diagnosed T2DM.

Abstract
  We compared the effect of dapagliflozin versus glibenclamide on the ratio of lean-to total mass in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, carotid subclinical atherosclerosis, HbA1c 7.0-9.0% and 40-70 years-old. Ninety-eight patients (61% male; mean age 57 +/- 7 years) were randomized into dapagliflozin 10 mg/day or glibenclamide 5 mg/day on top of metformin. Body composition was measured by Dual Energy X-Ray at randomization and after 12 weeks of treatment. Glycemic control was equivalent in both groups. Dapagliflozin decreased total body mass (-2741 g [95% CI: -3360 to 1945]; p < 0.001) and lean mass (-347 g [95% CI: -761 to -106]; p < 0.001), while glibenclamide increased total body mass (1060 g [95% CI: 140 to 1836]; p < 0.001) and lean mass (929 g [95% CI: 575 to 1283]; p < 0.001) for the differences between arms. The lean-to-total mass ratio increased by 1.2% in the dapagliflozin group and 0,018% in the glibenclamide group (p < 0.001). Dapagliflozin reduced the risk of a negative balance in the lean-to total mass ratio [OR: 0.16 (95% CI: 0.05 to 0.45); p < 0.001] even after adjustment for baseline lean-to total mass ratio, waist circumference, HOMAIR, HbA1c, mean of the two hands handgrip strength and gait speed [OR: 0.13 (95% CI: 0.03-0.57); p < 0.007]. In conclusion, under equivalent glycemic control, dapagliflozin reduced total body mass but increased the ratio of lean-to-total mass when compared with glibenclamide.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: We tested the feasibility of using sitagliptin-a dipeptidyl peptidase-IV inhibitor-for depressive symptoms in type 2 diabetes (T2D).

   METHODS: In a feasibility, double-blind, randomized controlled trial, we recruited people aged 18 to 75 years with T2D (glycated hemoglobin A1c levels >=53 and <=86 mmol/mol prescribed oral hypoglycemic therapy) and comorbid depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score >=10) from family practices in South London. Eligible patients were randomized to sitagliptin 100 mg per day or matched placebo for 12 weeks. The primary feasibility outcomes were participation rates, attrition rates, and adverse events. The primary clinical outcomes were depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology scores) at 12 weeks as assessed using analyses of covariance. Ranges of treatment effects were estimated using Cohen d and associated 95% confidence intervals, where negative values favored sitagliptin over placebo.

   RESULTS: Of 153 people screened across 32 practices, 44 were randomized (22 to each arm). The mean (standard deviation) age was 58.8 (8.3) years, 46% were female, and 52% were of non-white ethnicity. Of those treated, 1 patient (4.5%) in each arm withdrew, and there were no group differences in adverse events. Despite improving 12-week glycated hemoglobin A1c (d = -1.19 [95% confidence interval = -1.90 to -0.48), improvement in 12-week Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology score with sitagliptin was inferior to placebo across the range of estimated treatment effects (d = 0.71 [0.13 to 1.30]). Effects of sitagliptin on inflammation were inconsistent (d = -0.32 [-0.81 to 0.17] for high-sensitivity C-reactive protein).

   CONCLUSIONS: Repositioning of oral hypoglycemic therapy for depressive symptoms in T2D is feasible. However, in this unpowered feasibility study, we did not detect evidence of superiority of sitagliptin over placebo. The results are cautioned by the small sample size and limited treatment duration.Trial Registration: EudraCT: 2015-004527-32. Copyright © 2021 by the American Psychosomatic Society.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Some studies have suggested a relationship between type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and increased incidence of melanoma. Efforts are under way to identify preventable and treatable factors associated with greater melanoma aggressiveness, but no studies to date have examined the relationship between T2DM and the aggressiveness of cutaneous melanoma at diagnosis.

   OBJECTIVES: To explore potential associations between T2DM, glycaemic control and metformin treatment and the aggressiveness of cutaneous melanoma.

   METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional multicentric study in 443 patients diagnosed with cutaneous melanoma. At diagnosis, all patients completed a standardized protocol, and a fasting blood sample was extracted to analyse their glucose levels, glycated haemoglobin concentration and markers of systemic inflammation. Melanoma characteristics and aggressiveness factors [Breslow thickness, ulceration, tumour mitotic rate (TMR), sentinel lymph node (SLN) involvement and tumour stage] were also recorded.

   RESULTS: The mean (SD) age of the patients was 55.98 (15.3) years and 50.6% were male. The median Breslow thickness was 0.85 mm. In total, 48 (10.8%) patients were diagnosed with T2DM and this finding was associated with a Breslow thickness > 2 mm [odds ratio (OR) 2.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.4-4.9; P = 0.004)] and > 4 mm (OR 3.6, 95% CI 1.7-7.9; P = 0.001), TMR > 5 per mm2 (OR 4.5, 95% CI 1.4-13.7; P = 0.009), SLN involvement (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1-5.7; P = 0.038) and tumour stages III-IV (vs. I-II) (OR 3.4, 95% CI 1.6-7.4; P = 0.002), after adjusting for age, sex, obesity, alcohol intake and smoking habits. No significant associations emerged between glycated haemoglobin levels, metformin treatment and melanoma aggressiveness.

   CONCLUSIONS: T2DM, rather than glycaemic control and metformin treatment, is associated with increased cutaneous melanoma aggressiveness at diagnosis. Copyright © 2021 British Association of Dermatologists.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) is highly prevalent after stroke and is associated with recurrent stroke and unfavourable outcome.

   OBJECTIVES: We aimed to assess the feasibility, safety and effects on glucose metabolism of metformin or sitagliptin in patients with transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or minor ischaemic stroke and IGT.

   DESIGN: We performed a multicentre, randomised, controlled, open-label phase II trial with blinded outcome assessment.

   INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomised in a 2:1:1 ratio to 'no medication', sitagliptin or metformin.

   PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome measures were baseline adjusted differences of 2-hour postload glucose; secondary outcome measures fasting glucose, glycosylated haemoglobin 1c (HbA1c) levels, tolerability and safety of metformin and sitagliptin at 6 months. Patients on metformin or sitagliptin were contacted by telephone for recording of possible adverse events and to support continuation of treatment at 2 weeks, 6 weeks and 3 months after inclusion. These events were not analysed as outcome measures.

   RESULTS: Fifty-three patients were randomised to control group, 26 to metformin and 22 to sitagliptin. We found no significant differences in 2-hour postload glucose between patients on antidiabetic drugs and controls ((-0.04 mmol/L (95% CI -0.53 to 0.45)). Patients in the treatment arms had reduced fasting glucose: ((-0.21 mmol/L (95% CI -0.36 to -0.06)) and HbA1c levels ((-1.16 mmol/mol (95% CI -1.84 to -0.49)). Thirteen patients (50%) on metformin and 7 (32%) on sitagliptin experienced side effects. Sixteen patients (61%) in the metformin and 13 (59%) in the sitagliptin group were still on treatment after 6 months.

   CONCLUSIONS: Metformin and sitagliptin were both effective in reducing fasting glucose and HbA1c levels in patients with recent TIA or minor ischaemic stroke and IGT. However, the reduction of glucose levels and sample size was relatively small. The clinical relevance, therefore, needs to be tempered. A phase III trial is needed to investigate whether medical treatment, compared with lifestyle intervention or a combination of both, not only improves glucose metabolism in IGT, but also leads to reduction of recurrent TIA or ischaemic stroke in these patients.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To compare effects of medications and laparoscopic gastric band surgery (LB) on alpha-cell function in dysglycemic youth and adults in the Restoring Insulin Secretion (RISE) Study protocols.

   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Glucagon was measured in three randomized, parallel, clinical studies: 1) 91 youth studied at baseline, after 12 months on metformin alone (MET) or glargine followed by metformin (G/M), and 3 months after treatment withdrawal; 2) 267 adults studied at the same time points and treated with MET, G/M, or liraglutide plus metformin (L+M) or given placebo (PLAC); and 3) 88 adults studied at baseline and after 12 and 24 months of LB or MET. Fasting glucagon, glucagon suppression by glucose, and acute glucagon response (AGR) to arginine were assessed during hyperglycemic clamps. Glucagon suppression was also measured during oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs).

   RESULTS: No change in fasting glucagon, steady-state glucagon, or AGR was seen at 12 months following treatment with MET or G/M (in youth and adults) or PLAC (in adults). In contrast, L+M reduced these measures at 12 months (all P <= 0.005), which was maintained 3 months after treatment withdrawal (all P < 0.01). LB in adults also reduced fasting glucagon, steady-state glucagon, and AGR at 12 and 24 months (P < 0.05 for all, except AGR at 12 months [P = 0.098]). Similarly, glucagon suppression during OGTTs was greater with L+M and LB. Linear models demonstrated that treatment effects on glucagon with L+M and LB were largely associated with weight loss.

   CONCLUSIONS: Glucagon concentrations were reduced by L+M and LB in adults with dysglycemia, an effect principally attributable to weight loss in both interventions. Copyright © 2021 by the American Diabetes Association.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To identify predictors of glycemic worsening among youth and adults with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes in the Restoring Insulin Secretion (RISE) Study.

   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 91 youth (10-19 years) were randomized 1:1 to 12 months of metformin (MET) or 3 months of glargine, followed by 9 months of metformin (G-MET), and 267 adults were randomized to MET, G-MET, liraglutide plus MET (LIRA+MET), or placebo for 12 months. All participants underwent a baseline hyperglycemic clamp and a 3-h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) at baseline, month 6, month 12, and off treatment at month 15 and month 21. Cox models identified baseline predictors of glycemic worsening (HbA1c increase >=0.5% from baseline).

   RESULTS: Glycemic worsening occurred in 17.8% of youth versus 7.5% of adults at month 12 (P = 0.008) and in 36% of youth versus 20% of adults at month 21 (P = 0.002). In youth, glycemic worsening did not differ by treatment. In adults, month 12 glycemic worsening was less on LIRA+MET versus placebo (hazard ratio 0.21, 95% CI 0.05-0.96, P = 0.044). In both age-groups, lower baseline clamp-derived beta-cell responses predicted month 12 and month 21 glycemic worsening (P < 0.01). Lower baseline OGTT-derived beta-cell responses predicted month 21 worsening (P < 0.05). In youth, higher baseline HbA1c and 2-h glucose predicted month 12 and month 21 glycemic worsening, and higher fasting glucose predicted month 21 worsening (P < 0.05). In adults, lower clamp- and OGTT-derived insulin sensitivity predicted month 12 and month 21 worsening (P < 0.05).

   CONCLUSIONS: Glycemic worsening was more common among youth than adults with IGT or recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes, predicted by lower baseline beta-cell responses in both groups, hyperglycemia in youth, and insulin resistance in adults. Copyright © 2021 by the American Diabetes Association.

Abstract
  PURPOSE: Numerous studies have suggested that metformin treatment can increase breast cancer survival; however, it is unclear whether its effects interact with intrinsic subtype or diabetic status. Therefore, we conducted a large nationwide study to assess this in women with surgically resected invasive breast cancer.

   METHODS: Patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer between 2007 and 2016 were identified using the national health insurance claims database of South Korea. Metformin or other drug exposures was defined as medication for >= 90 days. Breast cancer subtypes were classified into four groups based on hormonal therapy and anti-HER2 treatments.

   RESULTS: A total of 117,333 patients were included (median follow-up duration, 90 months). Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) affected significantly overall survival (OS, 7 years, 89.7% vs. 92.4%, p < 0.001). A significant interaction was found between the use of metformin and insulin in patients with T2DM (p = 0.018). Thus, the subsequent analysis was limited to these patients and propensity score matching was performed. We found significantly increased OS in patients treated with metformin (7-year OS, 88.3% vs. 85.6%, p < 0.001). Interestingly, a significant effect was observed in the hormonal therapy (HT)+/HER2-targeted therapy (Tx)- group (p < 0.001), whereas no specific association was observed in the HT-/HER2 Tx- group (p = 0.220).

   CONCLUSIONS: Metformin administration may be associated with reduced mortality in patients with surgically resected breast cancer, particularly in the HT+/HER2 Tx- group. Clinical trials investigating metformin as a combination agent in breast cancer should stratify patients by curative resection, intrinsic subtype, the presence of T2DM, and the use of insulin.

Abstract
  AIM: To assess the safety and efficacy of oral insulin (ORMD-0801) in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D).

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: After a 2-week washout of other medications, adult metformin-treated patients with T2D were randomized to receive placebo or 16 or 24 mg ORMD-0801, once daily, at bedtime, for 28 days. The mean change from baseline weighted mean night-time glucose levels was determined from 2 nights of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) recordings during the placebo run-in and last week of treatment.

   RESULTS: In total, 188 patients (HbA1c: 7.82% +/- 0.88% [placebo] and 8.08% +/- 1.11% [pooled ORMD-0801 group]) were enrolled. In the placebo group, mean night-time CGM increased from baseline by 13.7 +/- 26.1 mg/dL, whereas the increase was significantly smaller in the pooled ORMD-0801 group (1.7 +/- 23.5 mg/dL, P = .0120). Glycaemic control variables (24-hour, fasting and daytime CGM glucose) also displayed smaller increases with ORMD-0801 versus placebo. Change from baseline HbA1c was -0.01% in the pooled ORMD-0801 group versus +0.20% in the placebo group (P = .0149). ORMD-0801 was well tolerated, with similar adverse event and hypoglycaemia rates as placebo.

   CONCLUSIONS: In patients with T2D, bedtime ORMD-0801 curbed increases in night-time glycaemia, 24-hour glycaemia and HbA1c, without increasing the risk of hypoglycaemia or safety events compared with the control arm. Copyright © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Abstract
  AIM: To assess the effectiveness and safety of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in treatment-naive patients compared with metformin.

   PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: We conducted a cohort study of US adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus who had not filled a prescription for a diabetes medication in the preceding year. We then identified patients who newly filled a prescription for an SGLT2 inhibitor or metformin between 2013 and 2018. The primary outcome was a composite of heart failure, myocardial infarction or stroke. Safety outcomes included hypoglycaemia, diabetic ketoacidosis, genital infection, lactic acidosis and acute kidney injury. After 1:1 propensity-score (PS) matching, proportional hazards models were fit to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

   RESULTS: We identified 9964 individuals newly prescribed an SGLT2 inhibitor who were PS-matched to 9964 individuals newly prescribed metformin. The mean age was 54 years, 52% were women, and the duration of follow-up was 213 days for metformin and 147 days for SGLT2 inhibitors. The primary outcome occurred in 54 patients (7.2 events per 1000 person-years) who received an SGLT2 inhibitor, compared to 84 patients (8.5 per 1000 person-years) who received metformin (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.58, 1.15). Similar results (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.69, 1.09) were observed in an analysis with longer follow-up (ie, approximately 600 days). The rates of genital infection (HR 2.28, 95% CI 1.87, 2.78) and diabetic ketoacidosis (HR 1.58, 95% CI 0.92, 2.70) were higher for patients prescribed an SGLT2 inhibitor compared to metformin, while the rates of acute kidney injury (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.60, 1.47) or hypoglycaemia (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.48, 1.42) were not.

   CONCLUSIONS: We observed a numerically lower rate of short-/mid-term cardiovascular events for patients newly prescribed an SGLT2 inhibitor compared to metformin, albeit with wide CIs that include the possibility of a null effect. SGLT2 inhibitors were associated with a higher rate of genital infection and diabetic ketoacidosis. Larger cohort studies and long-term clinical trials powered to assess cardiovascular events are necessary to understand the risk-benefit profile of SGLT2 inhibitors as first-line therapy for adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Abstract
  AIM: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of dulaglutide 3.0 and 4.5 mg versus 1.5 mg when used as an add-on to metformin in subgroups defined by age (<65 and >=65 years).

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Of 1842 patients included in this post hoc analysis, 438 were aged 65 years or older and 1404 were younger than 65 years. The intent-to-treat (ITT) population, while on treatment without rescue medication, was used for all efficacy analyses; the ITT population without rescue medication was used for hypoglycaemia analyses; all other safety analyses used the ITT population.

   RESULTS: Patients aged 65 years or older and those younger than 65 years had a mean age of 69.5 and 53.2 years, respectively. In each age subgroup, the reduction from baseline in HbA1c and body weight (BW), and the proportion of patients achieving a composite endpoint of HbA1c of less than 7% (<53 mmol/mol) with no weight gain and no documented symptomatic or severe hypoglycaemia, were larger for dulaglutide 3.0 and 4.5 mg compared with dulaglutide 1.5 mg, but the treatment-by-age interactions were not significant. The safety profile for the additional dulaglutide doses was consistent with that of dulaglutide 1.5 mg and was similar between the age subgroups.

   CONCLUSION: Dulaglutide doses of 3.0 or 4.5 mg provided clinically relevant, dose-related improvements in HbA1c and BW with no significant treatment-by-age interactions, and with a similar safety profile across age subgroups.

Abstract
  AIMS: The LIRA-ADD2SGLT2i trial demonstrated that liraglutide + sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) +/- metformin significantly improved glycaemic control (not body weight) versus placebo in adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D). This post-hoc analysis assessed whether baseline characteristics influenced these findings.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: LIRA-ADD2SGLT2i (NCT02964247) was a placebo-controlled, double-blind, multinational trial, wherein participants received liraglutide (<=1.8 mg/day) or placebo (randomized 2:1). Changes from baseline to week 26 in haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), body weight and waist circumference stratified by HbA1c, body mass index (BMI), diabetes duration, duration of pre-trial SGLT2i use and Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) were analysed. These five baseline characteristics were divided into tertiles, and the treatment effect was evaluated using the trial product estimand.

   RESULTS: Data from all 303 participants were analysed. There was a significant interaction between baseline HbA1c tertiles (7.0%-<7.6%; 7.6%-8.1%; >=8.2%-9.5%) and glycaemic control at week 26 (p[interaction] = .011), with the lowest HbA1c estimated treatment difference (95% confidence interval) observed in patients with lowest baseline HbA1c [-0.20% (-0.59, 0.19); -0.68% (-1.03, -0.33); -0.98% (-1.33, -0.64), respectively]. There were no significant interactions in glycaemic control across baseline BMI, diabetes duration, insulin resistance determined by HOMA-IR or SGLT2i use duration (p[interaction] > .05, all). Across the five characteristics assessed, no significant interactions were found for body weight or waist circumference changes from baseline (p[interaction] > .05, all).

   CONCLUSION: For individuals with T2D and inadequate glycaemic control despite therapy with SGLT2is +/- metformin, liraglutide 1.8 mg would provide an effective treatment intensification option, irrespective of HbA1c, BMI, diabetes duration, insulin resistance determined by HOMA-IR and SGLT2i use duration.

Abstract
  Introduction: We evaluated the efficacy and safety of teneligliptin compared with placebo when added to metformin therapy in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin monotherapy.

   Methods: This multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study enrolled type 2 diabetes patients with glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) 7.0%-<10.0% and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) <270 mg/dl, receiving a stable metformin dose >=1000 mg/day. Teneligliptin 20 mg or placebo was administered orally once daily (qd) before breakfast for 24 weeks. The primary efficacy end-point was change in HbA1c from baseline to Week 24. Safety end-points included the incidence of adverse events (AEs).

   Results: The least square mean (LSM) change from baseline (standard error [SE]) was -0.72 (0.07) (95% confidence intervals [CI], -0.87, -0.58) for teneligliptin and -0.01 (0.07) (95% CI, -0.16, 0.13) for placebo. The differences (LSM +/- SE) between the placebo and teneligliptin groups in HbA1c and FPG were -0.71% +/- 0.11% (p < .0001) and -16.5 +/- 4.7 mg/dl (p = .0005), respectively. Teneligliptin yielded significant changes in HbA1c (-0.81%; p < .0001) and FPG (-22.2 mg/dl; p < .0001) at Week 12. At Week 24, more patients achieved HbA1c <7.0% with teneligliptin (41.7%) compared with placebo (16.1%; p < .0001). Treatment-emergent AE incidence was similar with teneligliptin (58.9%) and placebo (68.3%); upper respiratory tract infection, hyperuricaemia and hyperlipidaemia were the most common AEs.

   Conclusions: Teneligliptin 20 mg qd for 24 weeks added to ongoing metformin treatment significantly decreased HbA1c and FPG levels compared with placebo in Chinese type 2 diabetes patients. The combination was safe and tolerable. Copyright © 2021 The Authors. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Abstract
  Aim: To determine whether de-escalating from advanced insulin therapy (AIT) to the combined use of metformin, an SGLT2 inhibitor, a GLP1 receptor agonist and basal insulin is the better option than multiple daily insulin injections (MDI) in obese patients with poorly controlled T2DM.

   Methods: This was a 16-week, prospective, randomized, controlled trial. Twenty-two obese patients with T2DM on AIT were randomized to intervention (step-down) or control (MDI) group. In the intervention group, all prandial insulin injections were discontinued, but the patient remained on basal insulin and metformin, to which an SGLT2i and a GLP1 RA were added. In the control group, the patient remained on MDI.

   Results: Compared to control group (n = 8), A1c was significantly lower at week 4 (9.54% vs 8.25%; p = .0088) and week 16 (9.7% vs 7.31%; p < .001) in intervention group (n = 10). In intervention group, compared to baseline, there was a significant decrease in weight (-16.38 pounds; p = .003), BMI (-3.06; p < .001), LDL cholesterol (-15.7 mg/dl; p = .0378), total cholesterol (-18.5 mg/dl; p = .0386), total daily insulin dose (-57.3 units; p < .001) and a significant improvement in DM-SAT patient satisfaction 0-100 scores: total score (+45.3; p < .001) and subscale scores (Convenience + 35.28, p = .019; Lifestyle + 35.8, p = .0052; Medical control + 51.3, p < .001; Wellbeing + 47.2, p = .0091) at week 16.

   Conclusion: De-escalating from AIT to the combined use of metformin, SGLT2i, GLP1 RA and basal insulin in obese patients with poorly controlled T2DM on MDI resulted in significant improvement in glycaemic control, weight loss and significantly higher patient satisfaction. This stepping-down approach may be the better option than continuing MDI in these patients. Copyright © 2020 The Authors. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Abstract
  AIM: To evaluate the impact of dulaglutide 3.0 and 4.5 mg versus 1.5 mg on body weight in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) based on exploratory analyses of the AWARD-11 trial.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients were randomized to once-weekly dulaglutide 1.5 (n = 612), 3.0 (n = 616) or 4.5 mg (n = 614) for 52 weeks. The primary objective was superiority of dulaglutide 3.0 and/or 4.5 mg over 1.5 mg in HbA1c reduction at 36 weeks. Secondary and exploratory assessments included weight reduction in the overall trial population and baseline body mass index (BMI) and HbA1c subgroups.

   RESULTS: At baseline, patients had a mean age of 57.1 years, HbA1c 8.6% (70 mmol/mol), weight 95.7 kg and BMI 34.2 kg/m2 . At 36 weeks, dulaglutide 3.0 and 4.5 mg were superior to 1.5 mg for weight change from baseline (1.5 mg, -3.1 kg; 3.0 mg, -4.0 kg [P = .001]; 4.5 mg, -4.7 kg [P < .001]). Higher dulaglutide doses were associated with numerically greater weight reduction compared with 1.5 mg in each baseline BMI and HbA1c subgroup. Absolute weight reduction increased with increasing BMI category, but percentage weight loss was similar between subgroups. Weight reductions with dulaglutide were greater in patients with lower versus higher baseline HbA1c.

   CONCLUSIONS: In patients with T2D, inadequately controlled by metformin, incremental weight loss was observed with dulaglutide 1.5, 3.0 and 4.5 mg doses regardless of baseline BMI or HbA1c. Although absolute weight loss was numerically greater in patients with higher baseline BMI, percentage of weight loss was similar between BMI subgroups. Copyright © 2021 Eli Lilly and Company.

Abstract
  Post-transplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM) is a common complication of solid organ transplantation and a major cause of increased morbidity and mortality. Additionally, solid organ transplant patients may have pre-existent type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). While insulin is the treatment of choice for hyperglycemia in the first weeks after transplantation, there is no preferred first line agent for long-term management of PTDM or pre-existent T2DM. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors improve glycemic control, lower body weight, and blood pressure, are recommended after lifestyle and metformin as initial therapy for diabetic patients with cardiovascular or kidney comorbidities regarding their cardiorenal benefits. Furthermore, the mechanisms of action of GLP-1RA may counteract some of the driving forces for PTDM, as calcineurin-induced beta cell toxicity as per preclinical data, and improve obesity. However, their use in the treatment of PTDM is currently limited by a paucity of data. Retrospective observational and small exploratory studies suggest that GLP-1RA effectively improve glycemic control and induce weight loss in patients with PTDM without interacting with commonly used immunosuppressive agents, although randomized-controlled clinical trials are required to confirm their safety and efficacy. In this narrative review, we evaluate the risk factors and pathogenesis of PTDM and compare the potential roles of GLP-1RA and SGLT2 inhibitors in PTDM prevention and management as well as in pre-existent T2DM, and providing a roadmap for evidence generation on newer antidiabetic drugs for solid organ transplantation.

Abstract
  AIMS: To explore the effect of background treatment with metformin on the efficacy of GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) on cardiovascular outcomes in type 2 diabetes.

   METHODS: We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE through May 5, 2021 for randomized, placebo-controlled, cardiovascular outcomes trials of GLP-1 RAs in patients with type 2 diabetes that reported cardiovascular or mortality outcomes by baseline metformin use. Main outcome was incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Other outcomes included the individual components of the primary composite outcome (myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiovascular death), all-cause mortality and hospitalization for heart failure. We pooled hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) stratified by baseline use of metformin using random-effects meta-analysis.

   RESULTS: We included 4 trials (43,456 patients) assessing albiglutide, dulaglutide, exenatide once weekly and liraglutide. GLP-1 RAs reduced MACE by 13% (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.82-0.93), an effect which was consistent in both subgroups (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.85-0.97 and HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.72-0.90 with and without metformin, respectively). Presence of metformin at baseline did not affect the overall favorable effect of GLP-1 RAs both on cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Finally, subgroup meta-analyses suggested that GLP-1 RAs had a neutral effect on stroke, myocardial infarction and hospitalization for heart failure, irrespective of metformin use at baseline.

   CONCLUSIONS: Subgroup analyses suggested that treatment with GLP-1 RAs has a beneficial effect on cardiovascular outcomes irrespective of baseline use of metformin. However, given the exploratory nature of subgroup analyses, these findings should be treated as hypothesis-generating rather than conclusive evidence. Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVES: Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors reduce the incidence of heart failure and death in patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus. Arterial stiffness is a prominent risk factor for heart failure and overall mortality. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of dapagliflozin on ambulatory brachial and central blood pressure (BP) levels and arterial stiffness parameters in patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus.

   METHODS: This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial including 85 adult patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus on monotherapy or combination therapy with two of: metformin, sulphonylurea, DPP-4 inhibitor, or insulin. Patients were randomized in a 1 : 1 ratio to oral dapagliflozin 10 mg per day or placebo for 12 weeks. Study participants underwent 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring with the Mobil-O-Graph NG monitor at baseline and study-end.

   RESULTS: Baseline demographic, clinical and laboratory parameters were similar in the two groups. During follow-up, 24-h brachial SBP/DBP (129.0 +/- 12.6/77.3 +/- 7.3 vs. 123.2 +/- 12.4/75.1 +/- 6.4 mmHg; P < 0.001/P = 0.008) and central SBP/DBP (117.4 +/- 10.5/78.9 +/- 7.3 vs. 113.3 +/- 8.8/77.3 +/- 6.5 mmHg; P = 0.002/P = 0.047) significantly decreased in dapagliflozin but not in the placebo group. Corresponding reductions of 24-h brachial SBP (-5.8 +/- 9.5 vs. -0.1 +/- 8.7, P = 0.005) and central SBP (-4.1 +/- 8.0 vs. -0.7 +/- 7.8; P = 0.046) were greater with dapagliflozin than placebo. Twenty-four-hour heart-rate adjusted augmentation index significantly decreased with dapagliflozin and insignificantly with placebo. Importantly, there was a significant difference in change of estimated 24-h PWV (-0.16 +/- 0.32 vs. 0.02 +/- 0.27; P = 0.007) favoring dapagliflozin. In generalized linear mixed models including 24-h brachial SBP as a random covariate, the adjusted marginal means of delta 24-h central SBP and delta 24-h PWV were not significantly different between-groups.

   CONCLUSION: Treatment with dapagliflozin significantly reduces ambulatory brachial and central BP levels and PWV in patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus. Improvement in these parameters may substantially contribute to the cardiovascular benefits of SGLT-2 inhibitors. Copyright © 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: The shape of the glucose curve during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) reflects beta-cell function in populations without diabetes but has not been as well studied in those with diabetes. A monophasic shape has been associated with higher risk of diabetes, while a biphasic pattern has been associated with lower risk. We sought to determine if phenotypic or metabolic characteristics were associated with glucose response curve shape in adults with type 2 diabetes treated with metformin alone.

   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This is a cross-sectional analysis of 3108 metformin-treated adults with type 2 diabetes diagnosed <10 years who underwent 2-hour 75 g OGTT at baseline as part of the Glycemia Reduction Approaches in Diabetes: A Comparative Effectiveness Study (GRADE). Insulin sensitivity (homeostasis model of insulin sensitivity, HOMA2-S) and beta-cell function (early, late, and total incremental insulin and C peptide responses adjusted for HOMA2-S) were calculated. Glucose curve shape was classified as monophasic, biphasic, or continuous rise.

   RESULTS: The monophasic profile was the most common (67.8% monophasic, 5.5% biphasic, 26.7% continuous rise). The monophasic subgroup was younger, more likely male and white, and had higher body mass index (BMI), while the continuous rise subgroup was more likely female and African American/black. HOMA2-S and fasting glucose did not differ among the subgroups. The biphasic subgroup had the highest early, late, and total insulin and C peptide responses (all p<0.05 vs monophasic and continuous rise). Compared with the monophasic subgroup, the continuous rise subgroup had similar early insulin (p=0.3) and C peptide (p=0.6) responses but lower late insulin (p<0.001) and total insulin (p=0.008) and C peptide (p<0.001) responses.

   CONCLUSIONS: Based on the large multiethnic GRADE cohort, sex, race, age, and BMI were found to be important determinants of the shape of the glucose response curve. A pattern of a continuously rising glucose at 2 hours reflected reduced beta-cell function and may portend increased glycemic failure rates.

Abstract
  AIMS/INTRODUCTION: Recent randomized clinical trials have suggested that sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors might reduce cardiovascular events and heart failure, and have renal protective effects. Despite these remarkable benefits, the effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors on bone and muscle are unclear.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: A subanalysis of a randomized controlled study was carried out to evaluate the effects of the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, ipragliflozin, versus metformin on bone and muscle in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (baseline body mass index >=22 kg/m2 and hemoglobin A1c 7-10%) who were already receiving sitagliptin. These patients were randomly administered ipragliflozin 50 mg or metformin 1,000-1,500 mg daily. The effects of these medications on the bone formation marker, bone alkali phosphatase; the bone resorption marker, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b (TRACP-5b); handgrip strength; abdominal cross-sectional muscle area; and bone density of the fourth lumbar vertebra were evaluated.

   RESULTS: After 24 weeks of treatment, the changes in bone density of the fourth lumbar vertebra, handgrip strength and abdominal cross-sectional muscle area were not significantly different between the two groups. However, TRACP-5b levels increased in patients treated with ipragliflozin compared with patients treated with metformin (median 11.94 vs -10.30%, P < 0.0001), showing that ipragliflozin can promote bone resorption.

   CONCLUSIONS: There were no adverse effects on bone or muscle when sitagliptin was used in combination with either ipragliflozin or metformin. However, ipragliflozin combination increased the levels of TRACP-5b. A long-term study is required to further understand the effects of this TRACP-5b increase caused by ipragliflozin.

Abstract
  Metformin remains the first-line drug treatment for type 2 diabetes (T2D) in most guidelines not only because it achieves significant reduction in HbA1c but also because of a wealth of clinical experience regarding its safety and observational data that has shown that metformin use is associated with lower mortality rates when compared to sulphonylureas or insulin. Recently other diabetes drugs, particularly SGLT2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and GLP1 receptor agonists (GLP1RA), have attracted considerable attention for their cardioprotective benefits reported in cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs). Randomised control trials on these newer drugs are on a larger scale but have shorter follow-up than UKPDS, the main study supporting metformin use. In a recent change to the European Society of Cardiology guidelines, metformin was replaced by SGLT2i and GLP1RA as first-line for T2D with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, whereas American Diabetes Association and UK-wide guidelines maintain metformin as first choice drug pharmacotherapy for all T2D. A definitive evidence-base for prioritisation of these drugs is currently missing because there are no head-to-head clinical trial data. Without such trials being forthcoming, innovative, pragmatic and low-cost 'real-world' trial approaches based on electronic health records may need to be harnessed to determine the correct priority, combinations of drugs and/or identify-specific patient populations most likely to benefit from each one.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Hydroxychloroquine as add-on therapy in uncontrolled type 2 diabetes patients who were using two oral antidiabetic drugs.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group study in 304 inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes (T2DM) subjects with two oral antidiabetic drugs (glimepiride 4 mg and metformin 500 mg) were randomised to hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) 200 mg, 300 mg, 400 mg once daily (OD) or placebo. Dose of hydroxychloroquine was selected as per body weight of the subject. Primary end point was glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) change at week 12 from baseline. Secondary endpoint was change in fasting plasma glucose (FPG), post prandial plasma glucose (PPG), body weight and any adverse reaction including no of hypoglycemic events, as well as a change in the percentage of subjects with A1C < 7.0% and > 6.5% after 12 weeks of treatment.. In follow-up of 400 mg once daily was once again divided to 200 mg twice daily (BD) to study the effect on tolerability profile for further 12 weeks.

   RESULTS: Hydroxychloroquine was associated with significant reduction in HbA1c from baseline (7-8.5%) in 12 weeks -0.78%, -0.91% and 1.2% for hydroxychloroquine 200 mg, 300 mg and 400 mg OD, respectively, versus 0.13% with placebo (P < 0.005). FPG and PPG were reduced by -25 to -38 mg/dl and 34-53 mg/dl, respectively. Body weight also reduced in each group of HCQ. Hypoglycemia was reported only with 300 mg (1.2%) and 400 mg (2.1%) group of HCQ. It was observed that patients who complains with mild GI disturbance with HCQ 400 mg glycemic efficacy was maintained with 200 mg BD with significant relief of the symptoms.

   CONCLUSION: Hydroxychloroquine added to sulphonylurea and metformin, improves glycemic control significantly in T2DM patients. Glycemic effect of different dose of hydroxychloroquine is dose dependent. The safety/tolerability profile of hydroxychloroquine was favourable except GI disturbance which is more frequent with 400 mg. This can be avoided with 200 mg BD without compromise on efficacy.

Abstract
  Metformin was found to reduce elevated, but not normal, thyrotropin and prolactin levels. This non-randomized, uncontrolled pilot study investigated hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis activity in men with primary hypogonadism receiving metformin. The study population included 29 men with prediabetes, 10 of whom had been diagnosed with primary hypogonadism. Throughout the study, the participants were treated with metformin (2.55-3 g daily). Glucose homeostasis markers (fasting glucose, glycated hemoglobin, and HOMA1-IR), as well as circulating levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), testosterone, thyrotropin, prolactin, estradiol, and creatinine, were assessed at the beginning of the study and 16 weeks later. Both groups differed in baseline gonadotropin and testosterone levels. Fasting glucose, glycated hemoglobin, and HOMA1-IR were lower after than before metformin treatment. The changes in fasting glucose and HOMA1-IR were more pronounced in hypogonadal men than in subjects with testosterone levels within the reference range. Only in hypogonadal men, plasma concentrations of FSH and LH were lower at the end than at the beginning of the study. Levels of the remaining hormones remained unchanged throughout the study period. The reduction in FSH and LH levels correlated with their baseline levels and with the changes in HOMA1-IR. The results of our study suggest that metformin may decrease FSH and LH levels in men with hypergonadotropic hypogonadism. Copyright © 2020 Societe Francaise de Pharmacologie et de Therapeutique.

Abstract
  Type 2 diabetes has become a major disease burden in twenty-first century. Both incidence and prevalence of type 2 diabetes have quadrupled between 1980 and 2004 in the whole world. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is the major complication of type 2 diabetes. The introduction of statins in clinical settings is the first revolution in our battle against ASCVD. Most ASCVDs could be prevented or treated with statins. However, statin failed to reduce chronic kidney diseases (CKD) and heart failure (HF). Owing to a mandate from US Food and Drug Administration in 2008 that every new antidiabetic drug should be tested in clinical trials to demonstrate its safety, we now have a good opportunity to look for better antidiabetic drugs not only to decrease blood sugar but also to decrease CVD or renal disease. Among them, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and sodium-glucose transport protein 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2 i) are two most extensively studied ones. SGLT-2 i, in particular, prevent CKD and end-stage renal disease, and prevent HF. In the recent CREDENCE trial, canagliflozin reduced renal endpoints by 34% and end-stage renal disease by 32%. Furthermore, in the recent DAPA-HF trial, dapagliflozin decreased hospitalization for HF/cardiovascular death by 26%, and total death by 17%, in patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction, irrespective of diabetes or nondiabetes. The beneficial effects of SGLT-2 i in CKD and HF are complementary to the effects of statins. The introduction of SGLT-2 i in clinical practice is the second revolution in cardiovascular prevention.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: The glucose-lowering independent effect of sodium glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) on arterial wall function has not yet been clarified. This study aims to assess whether SGLT2i treatment can attenuate endothelial dysfunction related to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) compared with glucose-lowering equivalent therapy.

   METHODS: In a prospective, open-label, single-center, randomized clinical trial, 98 patients with T2DM and carotid intima-media thickness above the 75th percentile were randomized 1:1 to 12 weeks of therapy with dapagliflozin or glibenclamide in addition to metformin in glucose-lowering equivalent regimens. The coprimary endpoints were 1-min flow-mediated dilation (FMD) at rest and 1-min FMD after 15 min of ischemia followed by 15 min of reperfusion time (I/R).

   RESULTS: Ninety-seven patients (61% males, 57 +/- 7 years) completed the study. The median HbA1c decreased by - 0.8 (0.7)% and -0.7 (0.95)% following dapagliflozin and glibenclamide, respectively. The first coprimary endpoint, i.e., rest FMD changed by + 3.3(8.2)% and - 1.2(7.5)% for the dapagliflozin and glibenclamide arms, respectively (p = 0.0001). Differences between study arms in the second coprimary endpoint were not significant. Plasma nitrite 1 min after rest FMD was higher for dapagliflozin [308(220) nmol/L] than for glibenclamide (258[110] nmol/L; p = 0.028). The resistive indices at 1 min [0.90 (0.11) vs. 0.93 (0.07); p = 0.03] and 5 min [0.93 (0.07) vs. 0.95 (0.05); p = 0.02] were higher for the glibenclamide group than for the dapagliflozin group. Plasma biomarkers for inflammation and oxidative stress did not differ between the treatments.

   CONCLUSIONS: Dapagliflozin improved micro- and macrovascular endothelial function compared to glibenclamide, regardless of glycemic control in patients with T2DM and subclinical carotid atherosclerotic disease.

Abstract
  CONTEXT: Youth-onset type 2 diabetes is a disease of pubertal onset, associated with additional burden of pubertal insulin resistance on the beta-cell.

   OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the impact of metformin treatment during puberty, a critical window of cardiometabolic change, on insulin sensitivity (Si) and compensatory beta-cell response in youth with obesity.

   SETTING: Pediatric academic hospital clinical translational research center.

   PARTICIPANTS: Healthy youth in early puberty [Tanner stage (T) 2-3] with normoglycemia and obesity (n = 44).

   INTERVENTION: Double-blinded placebo-control trial of metformin during puberty (until T5).

   MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Insulin sensitivity (Si), insulin response [acute insulin response to glucose (AIRg)], and disposition index (DI), estimated from frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance testing; body fat (dual X-ray absorptiometry); and other laboratory parameters, collected at baseline, T4, and T5. Placebo-subtracted treatment effect was calculated using linear mixed models.

   RESULTS: At T5, metformin treatment, adjusting for sex, race, and baseline value, was associated with improved BMI z-score (-0.44 +/- 0.16, P = 0.02), percentage body fat (%body fat; -3.4 +/- 1.2%, P = 0.06), and waist circumference (-11.3 +/- 3.2cm, P = 0.003). There were no significant treatment effects at T5 on Si or secretion: Si (0.85 +/- 0.87 x 10-4/min-1/muIU/mL, P = 0.34), AIRg (-259 +/- 386 muIU/mL, P = 0.51), or DI (508 +/- 802 x 10-4/min-1, P = 0.53). High baseline DI predicted longitudinal decline in DI.

   CONCLUSIONS: Two years of metformin treatment in obese youth during puberty improved BMI and body fat, but not Si or beta-cell function. Of note, high DI in early puberty may be predictive of later decline in DI. Further studies are needed to develop strategies for preservation of beta-cell function in youth at risk for type 2 diabetes. Copyright © The Author(s) 2021.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) has been shown to be dysfunctional in both type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) leading to poor regeneration of endothelium and renal perfusion. EPCs have been shown to be a robust cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk indicator. Effect of sodium glucose channel inhibitors (SGLT2i) such as Canagliflozin (CG) on a cellular biomarker such as CD34+ve progenitor cells, which may help predict CVD risk, in patients with T2DM with established CKD has not been explored.

   METHODS: This is a pilot study where 29 subjects taking metformin and/or Insulin were enrolled in a 16 week, double blind, randomized placebo matched trial, with a low dose 100 mg CG as the intervention group compared to matched placebo. Type 2 diabetes subjects (30-70 years old), with hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of 7-10%, were enrolled. CD34+ve cell number, migratory function, gene expression along with vascular parameters such as arterial stiffness, serum biochemistry pertaining to cardio-metabolic health, resting energy expenditure and body composition were measured. Data were collected at week 0, 8 and 16. A mixed model regression analysis was done and p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

   RESULTS: A significant expression of CXCR4 receptor with a concomittant increase in migratory function of CD34+ve cells was observed in CG treated group as compared to placebo group. Gene expression analysis of CD34+ve cells showed an increase in expression of antioxidants (superoxide dismutase 2 or SOD2, Catalase and Glutathione Peroxidase or GPX) and notable endothelial markers (PECAM1, VEGF-A, and NOS3). A significant reduction in glucose and HbA1c levels were observed along with improved systolic and diastolic blood pressure in the CG group. A significant increase in adiponectin (p = 0.006) was also noted in treatment group. Urinary exosomal protein leak in urine, examining podocyte health (podocalyxin, Wilm's tumor and nephrin) showed reduction with CG CONCLUSION: Low dose Canagliflozin has a beneficial effect on CD34+ cell function, serum biochemistry and urinary podocyte specific exosomes in type 2 diabetes.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Metformin is a first-line drug in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) treatment, yet whether metformin may increase all-cause or cardiovascular mortality of T2DM patients remains inconclusive.

   METHODS: We searched PubMed and Embase for data extracted from inception to July 14, 2020, with a registration in PROSPERO (CRD42020177283). This study included randomized controlled trials (RCT) assessing the cardiovascular effects of metformin for T2DM. This study is followed by PRISMA and Cochrane guideline. Risk ratio (RR) with 95% CI was pooled across trials by a random-effects model. Primary outcomes include all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality.

   RESULTS: We identified 29 studies that randomly assigned patients with 371 all-cause and 227 cardiovascular death events. Compared with untreated T2DM patients, metformin-treated patients was not associated with lower risk of all-cause mortality (RR: 0.98; 95%CI: 0.69-1.38; P = 0.90), cardiovascular mortality (RR: 1.13; 95% CI: 0.60, 2.15; P = 0.70), macrovascular events (RR: 0.87; 95%CI: 0.70-1.07; P = 0.19), heart failure (RR: 1.02; 95% CI:0.61-1.71; P = 0.95), and microvascular events (RR: 0.78; 95% CI:0.54-1.13; P = 0.19). Combination of metformin with another hypoglycemic drug was associated with higher risk of all-cause mortality (RR: 1.49; 95% CI: 1.02, 2.16) and cardiovascular mortality (RR: 2.21; 95% CI: 1.22, 4.00) compared with hypoglycemic drug regimens with no metformin.

   CONCLUSION: The combination of metformin treatment may impose higher risk in all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. This finding, at least in part, shows no evidence for benefits of metformin in combination in terms of all-cause/cardiovascular mortality and cardiovascular events for T2DM. However, the conclusion shall be explained cautiously considering the limitations from UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS).

Abstract
  AIM: Ipragliflozin is a new antidiabetic agent that works through enhancing renal glucose excretion. We aim to synthesize evidence from published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the safety and efficacy of ipragliflozin in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

   METHODS: We searched PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central register of clinical trials using relevant keywords. Records were screened for eligible studies and data were extracted and synthesized using Review Manager Version 5.3 for windows. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were conducted.

   RESULTS: We included 13 RCTs (N=2535 patients) in the final analysis. The overall effect estimates favoured ipragliflozin 50mg monotherapy group over placebo in terms of: HbA1c (Standardized mean difference (SMD)=-1.20%, 95% Confidence interval (95% CI)=[-1.47, -0.93]; p<0.001), fasting plasma glucose (SMD=-1.30 mg/dL, 95% CI [-1.93, -0.67]; p<0.001), fasting serum insulin (SMD=-1.64 muU/mL, 95% CI [-2.70, -0.59]; p=0.002), and body weight (SMD=-0.85 kg, 95% CI [-1.19, -0.51]; p<0.001). Similarly, better glycemic control and significant body weight reduction compared to placebo were attained in ipragliflozin 50 mg combination with metformin, insulin with/without dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, sulfonylurea, and pioglitazone. Ipragliflozin, either alone or in combination, exhibits acceptable safety profile.

   CONCLUSION: The presented meta-analysis provides class one evidence that ipragliflozin is safe and effective in the management of T2DM either as monotherapy or an add-on. Copyright Thieme. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: The RISE Pediatric Medication Study compared strategies for preserving beta-cell function, including a 9-month follow-up after treatment withdrawal to test treatment effect durability.

   OBJECTIVE: Evaluate OGTT measures of glucose and beta-cell response through 12 months of intervention and 9 months of medication washout.

   PARTICIPANTS: Youth (n = 91) aged 10 to 19 years with BMI >=85th percentile and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes (T2D).

   METHODS: A multicenter randomized clinical trial comparing insulin glargine for 3 months followed by metformin for 9 months (G->Met) or metformin alone (Met) for 12 months. We report within-group changes from baseline to end of medication intervention (M12), baseline to 9 months post-medication withdrawal (M21), and end of medication (M12) to M21. OGTT C-peptide index [CPI] paired with 1/fasting insulin evaluated beta-cell response.

   RESULTS: At M12, both treatments were associated with stable fasting glucose (G->Met baseline 6.0 +/- 0.1 vs M12 5.9 +/- 0.2 mmol/L, P = .62; Met baseline 6.1 +/- 0.2 vs M12 6.0 +/- 0.2 mmol/L, P = .73) and 2-hour glucose (G->Met baseline 10.2 +/- 0.4 vs M12 9.3 +/- 0.5 mmol/L, P = .03; Met baseline 10.2 +/- 0.4 vs M12 10.6 +/- 0.6 mmol/L, P = .88). Following medication withdrawal, fasting glucose worsened (G->Met M21 8.6 +/- 1.8, P = .004; Met M21 7.8 +/- 0.7 mmol/L, P = .003), as did 2-hour glucose (G->Met M21 13.2 +/- 1.4, P = .002; Met M21 13.1 +/- 1.2 mmol/L, P = .006), associated with declines in beta-cell response.

   CONCLUSIONS: G->Met and Met were associated with stable glucose measures during 12 months of treatment in youth with IGT or recently diagnosed T2D. Glucose and beta-cell response worsened post-medication withdrawal, suggesting treatment must be long-term or alternative treatments pursued. Copyright © 2020 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: This study evaluated the potential of activating the fuel-sensing enzymes Adenine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase and the deacetylase sirtuin1, to promote weight loss. We tested the efficacy of a fixed dose combination of the amino acid leucine and 2 well-characterized agents with established safety profiles to modulate energy metabolism and facilitate weight loss.

   STUDY QUESTION: Will a combination of l-leucine with low-dose metformin and sildenafil produce a novel synergistic interaction that reduces body weight?

   STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a 24-week randomized controlled trial evaluating the effect on weight loss of leucine 1.1 g and sildenafil 1.0 mg or 4.0 mg, with and without metformin 500 mg (Leu/Sil 1.0, Leu/Sil 4.0, Leu/Met/Sil 1.0, and Leu/Met/Sil 4.0 twice/day). We enrolled 267 participants who were 18-65 years of age without diabetes and with the body mass index (BMI) of 30-45 kg/m2.

   MEASURES AND OUTCOMES: The primary endpoint was percentage weight change after 24 weeks. Adverse events were evaluated. The primary analysis was performed using the perprotocol population analysis of covariance estimation. Subgroup analyses of patients residing above certain threshold limits at baseline and in populations at increased risk of obesity were assessed post-hoc as exploratory end points.

   RESULTS: Placebo-adjusted mean bodyweight reductions in the Leu/Met/Sil 1.0, Leu/Met/Sil 4.0, and Leu/Sil 4.0 groups were -1.99%, -1.69%, and -1.67% (P = 0.015, 0.035, and 0.036, respectively). The most common adverse events were gastrointestinal-related and occurred in the metformin-treated groups consistent with metformin treatment. In African Americans, Leu/Met/Sil 1.0 produced 5.4% mean weight loss. In participants with BMI <40 kg/m2 treated with Leu/Met/Sil 1.0, the weight loss increased to 2.84%, particularly in participants with baseline insulin >=12mU/L (3.5%).

   CONCLUSIONS: Leu/Met/Sil 1.0 and 4.0 and Leu/Sil 4.0 reduced body weight, but Leu/Met/Sil 1.0 was associated with robust weight loss in African Americans, and individuals with BMI 30-39.9 kg/m2, especially participants with hyperinsulinemia.

Abstract
  CONTEXT: Inhibitors of sodium-glucose cotransporters-2 have cardio- and renoprotective properties. However, the underlying mechanisms remain indeterminate.

   OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of dapagliflozin on renal metabolism assessed by urine metabolome analysis in patients with type 2 diabetes.

   DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.

   SETTING: Outpatient diabetes clinic of a tertiary academic center.

   PATIENTS: Eighty patients with hemoglobin A1c > 7% on metformin monotherapy were prospectively enrolled.

   INTERVENTION: Fifty patients were treated with dapagliflozin for 3 months. To exclude that the changes observed in urine metabolome were merely the result of the improvement in glycemia, 30 patients treated with insulin degludec were used for comparison.

   MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Changes in urine metabolic profile before and after the administration of dapagliflozin and insulin degludec were assessed by proton-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.

   RESULTS: In multivariate analysis urine metabolome was significantly altered by dapagliflozin (R2X = 0.819, R2Y = 0.627, Q2Y = 0.362, and coefficient of variation analysis of variance, P < 0.001) but not insulin. After dapagliflozin, the urine concentrations of ketone bodies, lactate, branched chain amino acids (P < 0.001), betaine, myo-inositol (P < 0001), and N-methylhydantoin (P < 0.005) were significantly increased. Additionally, the urine levels of alanine, creatine, sarcosine, and citrate were also increased (P < 0001, P <0.0001, and P <0.0005, respectively) whereas anserine decreased (P < 0005).

   CONCLUSIONS: Dapagliflozin significantly affects urine metabolome in patients with type 2 diabetes in a glucose lowering-independent way. Most of the observed changes can be considered beneficial and may contribute to the renoprotective properties of dapagliflozin. Copyright © The Author(s) 2021.

Abstract
  Emotional distress, including depression and diabetes-specific distress (e.g., feeling overwhelmed by living with diabetes, feelings of failure related to diabetes self-care), is a significant and prevalent problem for patients with type 2 diabetes. Both depression and diabetes distress have been associated with metabolic/glycemic control, diabetes complications, mortality, and quality of life. Recent findings further suggest that risk for emotional distress is influenced by diabetes treatment. The GRADE Study (Glycemia Reduction Approaches in Diabetes: A Comparative Effectiveness Study) is generating prospective data that will provide a unique opportunity to examine the relationships between emotional distress, diabetes treatment, and outcomes in an experimental design. The GRADE study is a randomized clinical trial that will compare the metabolic effects of four common anti-hyperglycemic drugs when combined with metformin. This sub-study recruited a subset (n = 1739) of GRADE participants and will examine patient-level variation in baseline emotional distress as a predictor of glycemic control and other health outcomes, independent of treatment effects. The study will also provide an experimental examination of treatment regimen effects on emotional distress over time as part of the overall evaluation of comparative effectiveness. Evaluation of emotional distress using validated measures will allow us to disentangle the roles of depressive symptoms and diabetes distress, factors that share significant overlap but require distinct approaches to screening and treatment. Study findings may directly influence practice decisions regarding screening and treatment for emotional distress as part of diabetes care. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01794143.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVES: Using a US payer perspective, this study aimed to compare the lifetime cost-effectiveness of adding sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors vs switching to glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) among patients with type 2 diabetes who were not at glycated hemoglobin A1c target after dual therapy with metformin and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors.

   STUDY DESIGN: The cost-effectiveness analysis was performed with the validated IQVIA Core Diabetes Model. Treatment effects were obtained from randomized clinical trials with economic data based on published literature.

   METHODS: Risk of treatment-emergent adverse events and complications were simulated using submodels informed by published risk equations adjusted for patient characteristics, physiological parameters, and history of complications. Outcomes included cumulative incidence of micro- and macrovascular complications, life-years (LYs), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and total costs. Scenario analyses were performed to assess robustness of results to variations in clinical and cost inputs and assumptions.

   RESULTS: Over a lifetime time horizon, adding an SGLT2 inhibitor dominated the strategy of switching to a GLP-1 RA, improving survival by 0.049 LYs and 0.026 QALYs, and was associated with cost savings of $9511. The majority of the scenario analyses confirmed dominance of the DPP-4 inhibitor + SGLT2 inhibitor pathway vs the GLP-1 RA pathway. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis reinforced the base-case finding of cost savings while gaining QALYs.

   CONCLUSIONS: Intensification with an SGLT2 inhibitor on top of a DPP-4 inhibitor demonstrated slightly better efficacy and cost savings compared with switching to a GLP-1 RA in patients not at glycemic goal with metformin and a DPP-4 inhibitor.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND & AIMS: High glycaemic variability (GV) is associated with late complications in type 2 diabetes (T2D). We hypothesised that a carbohydrate-reduced high-protein (CRHP) diet would reduce GV acutely in patients with T2D compared with a conventional diabetes (CD) diet.

   METHODS: In this controlled, randomised crossover study, 16 patients with metformin-treated T2D (median (IQR) age: 64.0 (58.8-68.0) years; HbA1c: 47 (43-57) mmol/mol; duration of T2D: 5.5 (2.8-10.3) years) were assigned to an energy-matched CRHP diet and CD diet (31E%/54E% carbohydrate, 29E%/16E% protein and 40E%/30E% fat, respectively) for two separate 48-h intervention periods. Interstitial continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) was performed to assess accepted measures of glycaemic variability, i.e. standard deviation (SD) around the sensor glucose level; coefficient of variation in percent (CV); mean amplitude of glucose excursions (MAGE); continuous overlapping net glycaemic action (CONGA1, CONGA4) of observations 1 and 4 h apart; and mean absolute glucose (MAG) change.

   RESULTS: All indices of glycaemic variability (mean +/- SD) were significantly reduced during CRHP diet compared with CD diet; including SD (1.0 +/- 0.3 (CRHP) vs 1.6 +/- 0.5 mmol/L (CD)), CV (12.3 +/- 3.8 vs 19.3 +/- 5.5%), MAGE (2.3 +/- 0.9 vs 4.2 +/- 1.3 mmol/L), CONGA1 (0.8 +/- 0.3 vs 1.5 +/- 0.4 mmol/L), CONGA4 (1.4 +/- 0.5 vs 2.5 +/- 0.8 mmol/L), and MAG change (0.9 +/- 0.3 vs 1.4 +/- 0.4 mmol/L/h) (p < 0.001 for all). Compared with the CD diet, the CRHP diet improved the diurnal glucose profile by reducing 24-h mean sensor glucose (7.7 +/- 1.6 vs 8.6 +/- 2.0 mmol/L).

   CONCLUSIONS: In T2D patients treated with diet and metformin, two days of iso-energetic replacement of dietary carbohydrates by protein and fat reduced all indices of glycaemic variability by 36%-45% when compared with a conventional diabetes diet. These data may support reduction of carbohydrates as dietary advice for T2D patients. CLINICALTRIALS.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a global epidemic, and nations are struggling to implement effective healthcare strategies to reduce the burden. While efficacy studies demonstrate that metformin can reduce incident T2D by half among younger, obese adults with prediabetes, its real-world effectiveness are understudied, and its use for T2D prevention in primary care is low. We describe the design of a pragmatic trial to evaluate the incremental effectiveness of metformin, as an adjunct to a simple lifestyle counseling.

   METHODS: The "Prevencion de la Diabetes con Ejercicio, Nutricion y Tratamiento" [Diabetes Prevention with Exercise, Nutrition and Treatment; PRuDENTE, (Spanish acronym)] is a cluster-randomized trial in Mexico City's public primary healthcare system. The study randomly assigns 51 clinics to deliver one of two interventions for 36months: 1) lifestyle only; 2) lifestyle plus metformin, to 3060 patients ages 30-65 with impaired fasting glucose and obesity. The primary endpoint is incident T2D (fasting glucose >=126mg/dL, or HbA1c >=6.5%). We will also measure a range of implementation-related process outcomes at the clinic-, clinician- and patient-levels to inform interpretations of effectiveness and enable efforts to refine, adapt, adopt and disseminate the model. We will also estimate the cost-effectiveness of metformin as an adjunct to lifestyle counseling in Mexico.

   DISCUSSION: Findings from this pragmatic trial will generate new translational knowledge in Mexico and beyond, both with respect to metformin's real-world effectiveness among an 'at-risk' population, and uncovering facilitators and barriers to the reach, adoption and implementation of metformin preventive therapy in public primary care settings.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Capparis spinosa, Rosa canina, Securidaca securigera, Silybum marianum, Urtica dioica, Trigonella foenum-graecum and Vaccinium arctostaphylos are used traditionally as an herbal combination for treatment of diabetic patients in Iran. Despite the clinical evidence supporting their use in solitary form, no controlled human study has determined the efficacy and safety of their combination in treatment of diabetic patients.

   METHODS: A total 150 type II diabetic patients of both sexes under the oral anti-hyperglycemic drugs treatment (maximum 10 mg glyburide and 1000 mg metformin daily) were randomly assigned to three groups. The patients in each group received either herbal combination or placebo or metformin capsule daily for three months, without any change in their previous oral anti-hyperglycemic drugs dosage. Herbal combination, placebo and metformin capsules matched by shape and color were prepared in the Institute of Medicinal Plants Karaj, Iran. To assess the efficacy and safety of the treatments, the patients fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c, lipid profile, liver enzymes and renal function were determined at the beginning of the study and after three months.

   RESULTS: Results showed that after three months, the fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c and cholesterol levels in herbal combination were decreased significantly as compared to placebo group (20% and 12% respectively) and also compared to base line (25% and 15% respectively). The herbal combination was as effective as metformin in reduction of FPG (p = 0.001, p = 0.001) and HbA1c (p = 0.028 and p = 0.050 respectively) compared to placebo. No notable hepatic, renal and gastrointestinal side effects were observed in the trial groups.

   CONCLUSION: The results suggest that traditional herbal combination may safely improve glycemic control in type II diabetic patients with no significant adverse effect. [Formula: see text].

Abstract
  The presence of islet autoantibodies and islet reactive T cells (T+) in adults with established type 2 diabetes (T2D) have been shown to identify those patients with more severe beta-cell dysfunction. However, at what stage in the progression toward clinical T2D does islet autoimmunity emerge as an important component influencing beta-cell dysfunction? In this ancillary study to the Restoring Insulin SEcretion (RISE) Study, we investigated the prevalence of and association with beta-cell dysfunction of T+ and autoantibodies to the 65 kDa glutamic acid decarboxylase antigen (GADA) in obese pre-diabetes adults with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and recently diagnosed treatment naive (Ndx) T2D. We further investigated the effect of 12 months of RISE interventions (metformin or liraglutide plus metformin, or with 3 months of insulin glargine followed by 9 months of metformin or placebo) on islet autoimmune reactivity. We observed GADA(+) in 1.6% of NdxT2D and 4.6% of IGT at baseline, and in 1.6% of NdxT2D and 5.3% of IGT at 12 months, but no significant associations between GADA(+) and beta-cell function. T(+) was observed in 50% of NdxT2D and 60.4% of IGT at baseline, and in 68.4% of NdxT2D and 83.9% of IGT at 12 months. T(+) NdxT2D were observed to have significantly higher fasting glucose (p = 0.004), and 2 h glucose (p = 0.0032), but significantly lower steady state C-peptide (sscpep, p = 0.007) compared to T(-) NdxT2D. T(+) IGT participants demonstrated lower but not significant (p = 0.025) acute (first phase) C-peptide response to glucose (ACPRg) compared to T(-) IGT. With metformin treatment, T(+) participants were observed to have a significantly lower Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c, p = 0.002) and fasting C-peptide (p = 0.002) compared to T(-), whereas T(+) treated with liraglutide + metformin had significantly lower sscpep (p = 0.010) compared to T(-) participants. In the placebo group, T(+) participants demonstrated significantly lower ACPRg (p = 0.001) compared to T(-) participants. In summary, T(+) were found in a large percentage of obese pre-diabetes adults with IGT and in recently diagnosed T2D. Moreover, T(+) were significantly correlated with treatment effects and beta-cell dysfunction. Our results demonstrate that T(+) are an important component in T2D.

Abstract
  CONTEXT: Novel dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist (RA) tirzepatide demonstrated substantially greater glucose control and weight loss (WL) compared with selective GLP-1RA dulaglutide.

   OBJECTIVE: Explore mechanisms of glucose control by tirzepatide.

   DESIGN: Post hoc analyses of fasting biomarkers and multiple linear regression analysis.

   SETTING: Forty-seven sites in 4 countries.

   PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Three hundred and sixteen subjects with type 2 diabetes.

   INTERVENTIONS: Tirzepatide (1, 5, 10, 15 mg), dulaglutide (1.5 mg), placebo.

   MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Analyze biomarkers of beta-cell function and insulin resistance (IR) and evaluate WL contributions to IR improvements at 26 weeks.

   RESULTS: Homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) 2-B significantly increased with dulaglutide and tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15 mg compared with placebo (P <= .02). Proinsulin/insulin and proinsulin/C-peptide ratios significantly decreased with tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg compared with placebo and dulaglutide (P <= .007). Tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg significantly decreased fasting insulin (P <= .033) and tirzepatide 10 mg significantly decreased HOMA2-IR (P = .004) compared with placebo and dulaglutide. Markers of improved insulin sensitivity (IS) adiponectin, IGFBP-1, and IGFBP-2 significantly increased by 1 or more doses of tirzepatide (P < .05). To determine whether improvements in IR were directly attributable to WL, multiple linear regression analysis with potential confounding variables age, sex, metformin, triglycerides, and glycated hemoglobin A1c was conducted. WL significantly (P <= .028) explained only 13% and 21% of improvement in HOMA2-IR with tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg, respectively.

   CONCLUSIONS: Tirzepatide improved markers of IS and beta-cell function to a greater extent than dulaglutide. IS effects of tirzepatide were only partly attributable to WL, suggesting dual receptor agonism confers distinct mechanisms of glycemic control. Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

  BACKGROUND: Tirzepatide is a novel dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and GLP-1 receptor agonist under development for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide versus titrated insulin degludec in people with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled by metformin with or without SGLT2 inhibitors.

   METHODS: In this open-label, parallel-group, multicentre (122 sites), multinational (13 countries), phase 3 study, eligible participants (aged >=18 years) had a baseline glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) of 7.0-10.5%, body-mass index of at least 25 kg/m2, stable weight, and were insulin-naive and treated with metformin alone or in combination with an SGLT2 inhibitor for at least 3 months before screening. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1), using an interactive web-response system, to once-weekly subcutaneous injection of tirzepatide (5, 10, or 15 mg) or once-daily subcutaneous injection of titrated insulin degludec, and were stratified by country, HbA1c, and concomitant use of oral antihyperglycaemic medications. Tirzepatide was initially given at 2.5 mg and the dose was escalated by 2.5 mg every 4 weeks until the assigned dose was reached. Insulin degludec was initially given at 10 U per day and was titrated once weekly to a fasting self-monitored blood glucose of less than 5.0 mmol/L (<90 mg/dL), following a treat-to-target algorithm, for 52 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was non-inferiority of tirzepatide 10 mg or 15 mg, or both, versus insulin degludec in mean change from baseline in HbA1c at week 52. Key secondary efficacy endpoints were non-inferiority of tirzepatide 5 mg versus insulin degludec in mean change from baseline in HbA1c at week 52, superiority of all doses of tirzepatide versus insulin degludec in mean change from baseline in HbA1c and bodyweight, and the proportion of participants achieving HbA1c of less than 7.0% (<53 mmol/mol) at week 52. We used a boundary of 0.3% to establish non-inferiority in HbA1c difference between treatments. Efficacy and safety analyses were assessed in the modified intention-to-treat population (all participants who received at least one dose of study drug). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT03882970, and is complete.

   FINDINGS: Between April 1 and Nov 15, 2019, we assessed 1947 participants for eligibility, 1444 of whom were randomly assigned to treatment. The modified intention-to-treat population was 1437 participants from the tirzepatide 5 mg (n=358), tirzepatide 10 mg (n=360), tirzepatide 15 mg (n=359), and insulin degludec (n=360) groups. From a mean baseline HbA1c of 8.17% (SD 0.91), the reductions in HbA1c at week 52 were 1.93% (SE 0.05) for tirzepatide 5 mg, 2.20% (0.05) for tirzepatide 10 mg, and 2.37% (0.05) for tirzepatide 15 mg, and 1.34% (0.05) for insulin degludec. The non-inferiority margin of 0.3% was met. The estimated treatment difference (ETD) versus insulin degludec ranged from -0.59% to -1.04% for tirzepatide (p<0.0001 for all tirzepatide doses). The proportion of participants achieving a HbA1c of less than 7.0% (<53 mmol/mol) at week 52 was greater (p<0.0001) in all three tirzepatide groups (82%-93%) versus insulin degludec (61%). At week 52, from a baseline of 94.3 kg (SD 20.1), all three tirzepatide doses decreased bodyweight (-7.5 kg to -12.9 kg), whereas insulin degludec increased bodyweight by 2.3 kg. The ETD versus insulin degludec ranged from -9.8 kg to -15.2 kg for tirzepatide (p<0.0001 for all tirzepatide doses). The most common adverse events in tirzepatide-treated participants were mild to moderate gastrointestinal events that decreased over time. A higher incidence of nausea (12-24%), diarrhoea (15-17%), decreased appetite (6-12%), and vomiting (6-10%) was reported in participants treated with tirzepatide than in those treated with insulin degludec (2%, 4%, 1%, and 1%, respectively). Hypoglycaemia (<54 mg/dL or severe) was reported in five (1%), four (1%), and eight (2%) participants on tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15 mg, respectively, versus 26 (7%) on insulin degludec. Treatment discontinuation due to an adverse event was more common in the tirzepatide groups than in the insulin degludec group. Five participants died during the study; none of the deaths were considered by the investigators to be related to the study treatment.

   INTERPRETATION: In patients with type 2 diabetes, tirzepatide (5, 10, and 15 mg) was superior to titrated insulin degludec, with greater reductions in HbA1c and bodyweight at week 52 and a lower risk of hypoglycaemia. Tirzepatide showed a similar safety profile to that of GLP-1 receptor agonists.

Abstract
  Metformin is the primary drug for type 2 diabetes treatment and a promising candidate for other disease treatment. It has significant deviations between individuals in therapy efficiency and pharmacokinetics, leading to the administration of an unnecessary overdose or an insufficient dose. There is a lack of data regarding the concentration-time profiles in various human tissues that limits the understanding of pharmacokinetics and hinders the development of precision therapies for individual patients. The physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model developed in this study is based on humans' known physiological parameters (blood flow, tissue volume, and others). The missing tissue-specific pharmacokinetics parameters are estimated by developing a PBPK model of metformin in mice where the concentration time series in various tissues have been measured. Some parameters are adapted from human intestine cell culture experiments. The resulting PBPK model for metformin in humans includes 21 tissues and body fluids compartments and can simulate metformin concentration in the stomach, small intestine, liver, kidney, heart, skeletal muscle adipose, and brain depending on the body weight, dose, and administration regimen. Simulations for humans with a bodyweight of 70kg have been analyzed for doses in the range of 500-1500mg. Most tissues have a half-life (T1/2) similar to plasma (3.7h) except for the liver and intestine with shorter T1/2 and muscle, kidney, and red blood cells that have longer T1/2. The highest maximal concentrations (Cmax) turned out to be in the intestine (absorption process) and kidney (excretion process), followed by the liver. The developed metformin PBPK model for mice does not have a compartment for red blood cells and consists of 20 compartments. The developed human model can be personalized by adapting measurable values (tissue volumes, blood flow) and measuring metformin concentration time-course in blood and urine after a single dose of metformin. The personalized model can be used as a decision support tool for precision therapy development for individuals.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Oral semaglutide was approved in 2019 for blood glucose control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and was the first oral glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA). T2DM is associated with substantial healthcare expenditures in the US, so the cost of a new intervention should be weighed against clinical benefits.

   OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the budget impact of a treatment pathway with oral semaglutide 14 mg daily versus oral sitagliptin 100 mg daily among patients not achieving target glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level despite treatment with metformin.

   METHODS: This study used the validated IQVIA TM CORE Diabetes Model to simulate the treatment impact of oral semaglutide 14 mg and sitagliptin 100 mg over a 5-year time horizon from a US healthcare sector (payer) perspective. Trial data (PIONEER 3) informed cohort characteristics and treatment effects, and literature sources informed event costs. Population and market share data were from the literature and data on file. The analysis evaluated the estimated budget impact of oral semaglutide 14 mg use for patients currently using sitagliptin 100 mg considering both direct medical and treatment costs to understand the impact on total cost of care, given underlying treatment performance and impact on avoidable events.

   RESULTS: In a hypothetical plan of 1 million lives, an estimated 1993 patients were treated with sitagliptin 100 mg in the target population. Following these patients over 5 years, the incremental direct medical and treatment costs of a patient using oral semaglutide 14 mg versus sitagliptin 100 mg was $US16,562, a 70.7% increase (year 2019 values). A hypothetical payer would spend an additional $US3,300,143 (7.1%) over 5 years for every 10% of market share that oral semaglutide 14 mg takes away from sitagliptin 100 mg. Univariate and scenario analyses with alternate inputs and assumptions demonstrated consistent results.

   CONCLUSIONS: Use of oral semaglutide 14 mg in patients currently receiving sitagliptin 100 mg substantially increases the budget impact for patients with T2DM whose blood glucose level is not controlled with metformin over a 5-year time horizon for US healthcare payers.

  Publisher Budget impact of oral semaglutide intensification versus sitagliptin among US patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus uncontrolled with metformin. Language: German
   plain-language-summary Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have many treatment options. Choices depend on factors such as cost, preference, and patient characteristics. Oral semaglutide was recently approved for the treatment of T2DM as the first oral therapy of its class. This study estimated the cost for patients treated with sitagliptin 100 mg, a commonly used T2DM treatment, versus oral semaglutide 14 mg for patients whose disease is not well controlled with metformin. Costs and effects were estimated over 5 years for each treatment strategy using predictive model equations and clinical trial data for the two treatments. These costs were considered for both a hypothetical healthcare plan of 1 million lives and the full US population. A patient treated with oral semaglutide 14 mg would expect to see 70.7% higher costs than a patient treated with sitagliptin 100 mg over 5 years. For every 10% of patients who would switch from sitagliptin 100 mg to oral semaglutide 14 mg, costs would increase by 7.1%. Changing the cost of oral semaglutide 14 mg had the greatest impact on model results. The findings from the analysis were consistent across a range of alternate model inputs. Oral semaglutide 14 mg is more costly than sitagliptin 100 mg over 5 years. Language: English

Abstract
  Importance: Type 2 diabetes is common and is a leading cause of morbidity and disability.

   Objective: To review the evidence on screening for prediabetes and diabetes to inform the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF).

   Data Sources: PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and trial registries through September 2019; references; and experts; literature surveillance through May 21, 2021.

   Study Selection: English-language controlled studies evaluating screening or interventions for prediabetes or diabetes that was screen detected or recently diagnosed.

   Data Extraction and Synthesis: Dual review of abstracts, full-text articles, and study quality; qualitative synthesis of findings; meta-analyses conducted when at least 3 similar studies were available.

   Main Outcomes and Measures: Mortality, cardiovascular morbidity, diabetes-related morbidity, development of diabetes, quality of life, and harms.

   Results: The review included 89 publications (N = 68882). Two randomized clinical trials (RCTs) (25120 participants) found no significant difference between screening and control groups for all-cause or cause-specific mortality at 10 years. For harms (eg, anxiety or worry), the trials reported no significant differences between screening and control groups. For recently diagnosed (not screen-detected) diabetes, 5 RCTs (5138 participants) were included. In the UK Prospective Diabetes Study, health outcomes were improved with intensive glucose control with sulfonylureas or insulin. For example, for all-cause mortality the relative risk (RR) was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.79 to 0.96) over 20 years (10-year posttrial assessment). For overweight persons, intensive glucose control with metformin improved health outcomes at the 10-year follow-up (eg, all-cause mortality: RR, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.45 to 0.91]), and benefits were maintained longer term. Lifestyle interventions (most involving >360 minutes) for obese or overweight persons with prediabetes were associated with reductions in the incidence of diabetes (23 RCTs; pooled RR, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.69 to 0.88]). Lifestyle interventions were also associated with improved intermediate outcomes, such as reduced weight, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure (pooled weighted mean difference, -1.7 mm Hg [95% CI, -2.6 to -0.8] and -1.2 mm Hg [95% CI, -2.0 to -0.4], respectively). Metformin was associated with a significant reduction in diabetes incidence (pooled RR, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.64 to 0.83]) and reduction in weight and body mass index.

   Conclusions and Relevance: Trials of screening for diabetes found no significant mortality benefit but had insufficient data to assess other health outcomes; evidence on harms of screening was limited. For persons with recently diagnosed (not screen-detected) diabetes, interventions improved health outcomes; for obese or overweight persons with prediabetes, interventions were associated with reduced incidence of diabetes and improvement in other intermediate outcomes.

Abstract
  AIMS & OBJECTIVES: The objective of this retrospective study was to investigate the efficacy of adding remogliflozin to current insulin glargine plus two oral drug i.e. metformin and teneligliptin therapy in poorly controlled Indian type 2 diabetes.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: 173 study participants were initially selected from patient database who continued on their insulin glargine or received an increased dose of insulin glargine along with other OHA based therapy (Group A) and 187 were selected who had received remogliflozin (100 mg BD) (Group B) in addition to insulin glargine along with other OHA based therapy. Glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), total daily insulin dose, body weight, and the number of hypoglycemic events were recorded at weeks 0, 12 and 24.

   RESULTS: During the study, mean values of HbA1c, FBG and P2BG were significantly reduced in both groups. Insulin requirements decreased from 45.8 +/- 16.7 IU/day to 38.5 +/- 13.5 IU/day at week 12 (P < 0.001) and at week 24 even further decreased to 29.5 +/- 14.5 IU/Day. Twenty three patients in group B were able to cease insulin treatment altogether after 24 week treatment. It has been observed that to attain tight blood glucose control, we need to increase insulin dose in group A from 45.5 +/- 16.5 IU/Day to 51.5 +/- 14.5 at week 12 (P<0.01), which further increased to 53.8 +/- 12.8 IU/Day at week 24 (P<0.01). Adding remogliflozin showed significant effect on blood pressure (P < 0.001) and weight reduction (P < 0.001). It has been observed that 38% patients achieved targeted HbA1c (<=7%) in group B where it was 22% in group A.

   CONCLUSION: Results demonstrate that in uncontrolled T2DM patients, remogliflozin 100 mg BD can successfully lay a foundation for prolonged good glycemic control. Early addition of remogliflozin with insulin glargine plus OHAs may be an alternative compared to intensive up titration of insulin daily dose in people with uncontrolled T2DM.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: The use of fixed dose combination oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) in the therapeutic management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) patients is becoming popular among clinicians. Reduced pill burden with fixed combination OADs is generally perceived to improve adherence and efficacy. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy, tolerability and side effects (SEs) profile of vildagliptin-metformin (VM) combination with metformin-glibenclamide (MG) combination in type 2 DM patients at the Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital (AKTH).

   METHODS: A descriptive prospective open-labeled comparative out-patient study of type 2 DM patients spanning over three months with 60 Patients assigned to two treatment groups - VM (Group 1) and MG (Group 2) of 30 patients each. Parameters measured at baseline, 6 weeks and 12 weeks of study included demographic and anthropometric data; fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level; 2-hour post-prandial (2-hrPPG) glucose; liver function tests (LFTs); Electrolyte, Urea and Creatinine (EUCr); and fasting plasma lipids. Glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) was measured at baseline and at 12 weeks of the study. A p-value of <0.05 was considered to be significant.

   RESULTS: There was improvement in FPG, 2hr PPG, HbA1c in all subjects in both groups at the end of the study (6.44+/-0.79mmol/ l, 8.80+/-1.16mmol/l and 7.22+/-1.20% respectively in group 1(VM); and 6.40+/-0.83mmol/l, 9.29+/-1.39 and 7.25+/-0.96% respectively for group 2(MG). There was a significant improvement in body mass index (BMI) of subjects in group 1 (30.02+/-4.16 at baseline, 29.71+/-4.12 at study end) compared to those in group 2 (31.98+/-6.32 at baseline, 32.62+/-6.30 at study end), p=0.04. At the end of the study, the efficacy of VM (HbA1C-7.22+/-1.20%) was comparable to that of MG (HbA1c-7.25+/-0.96), P=0.92. The tolerability of MG (attrition rate 6.7%) was better than that of VM (attrition rate 13%), although this difference was not statistically significant P=0.16. The subjects on VM experienced more gastrointestinal (GIT) side effects compared to those on MG. The major SEs experienced by those on MG were hypoglycaemia and weight gain. VM was less tolerated and had more GIT side effects than MG.

   CONCLUSION: The use of single pill combination oral antidiabetic medications is associated with improved efficacy. Copyright © 2021 by West African Journal of Medicine.

  Publisher CONTEXTE: L'utilisation d'associations fixes d'antidiabetiques oraux (ADO) dans la prise en charge therapeutique des patients atteints de diabete sucre (DM) de type 2 est en train de devenir populaire parmi les cliniciens. La reduction du fardeau de la pilule avec des ADO a combinaison fixe est generalement percue comme ameliorant l'observance et l'efficacite. Le but de cette etude etait de comparer l'efficacite, la tolerabilite et le profil d'effets secondaires (ES) de l'association vildagliptine - metformine (VM) avec l'association metformine - glibenclamide (MG) chez des patients atteints de DM de type 2 a l'hopital universitaire Aminu Kano (AKTH).METHODES: Une etude descriptive prospective ouverte comparative ambulatoire de patients atteints de diabete de type 2 s'etalant sur trois mois avec 60 patients repartis en deux groupes de traitement - VM (groupe 1) et MG (groupe 2) de 30 patients chacun. Les parametres mesures au depart, 6 semaines et 12 semaines d'etude comprenaient des donnees demographiques et anthropometriques ; taux de glucose plasmatique a jeun (FPG); Glycemie post-prandiale 2 heures (2-hrPPG) ; tests de la fonction hepatique (LFT); electrolyte, uree et creatinine (EUCr); et les lipides plasmatiques a jeun. L'hemoglobine glyquee (HbA1c) a ete mesuree au depart et a 12 semaines de l'etude. Une valeur p < 0,05 a ete consideree comme significative.RESULTATS: Il y avait une amelioration de la FPG, 2h PPG, HbA1c chez tous les sujets dans les deux groupes a la fin de l'etude (6,44 +/- 0,79 mmol/l, 8,80 +/- 1,16 mmol/l et 7,22 +/- 1,20 % respectivement dans le groupe 1 (VM) et 6,40 +/- 0,83 mmol/l, 9,29 +/- 1,39 et 7,25 +/- 0,96 % respectivement pour le groupe 2 (MG). Il y avait une amelioration significative de l'indice de masse corporelle (IMC) des sujets du groupe 1 (30,02 +/- 4,16 au depart, 29,71 +/- 4,12 a la fin de l'etude) par rapport a ceux du groupe 2 (31,98 +/- 6,32 a l'inclusion, 32,62 +/- 6,30 a la fin de l'etude), p = 0,04. A la fin de l'etude, l'efficacite de la VM (HbA1C-7,22 +/- 1,20 %) etait comparable a celle de MG (HbA1c-7,25 +/- 0,96), P= 0,92. La tolerance de MG (taux d'attrition 6,7 %) etait meilleure que celle de VM (taux d'attrition 13 %), bien que cette difference n'ait pas ete statistiquement significative P= 0,16. Les sujets sous VM ont presente plus d'effets secondaires gastro-intestinaux (GIT) que ceux sous MG. Les principaux effets secondaires ressentis par ceux sous MG etaient l'hypoglycemie et la prise de poids. La VM etait moins toleree et avait plus d'effets secondaires GIT que MG.CONCLUSION: L'utilisation de medicaments antidiabetiques oraux combines a une seule pilule est associee a une efficacite amelioree.Mots cles: Diabete, Efficacite, Metformine-Glibenclamide, Tolerabilite, Vildagliptine-Metformine.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Beyond antihyperglycemic effects, metformin may improve cardiovascular outcomes. Patients with type 2 diabetes often have an elevated plasma level of N-terminal pro B-type as a marker of (sub) clinical cardiovascular disease. We studied whether metformin was associated with a reduction in the serum level of N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) in these patients.

   METHODS: In the HOME trial 390 insulin-treated patients with type 2 diabetes were randomized to 850 mg metformin or placebo three times daily. Plasma samples were drawn at baseline, 4, 17, 30, 43 and 52 months. In a post-hoc analysis we analyzed the change in NT-proBNP in both groups. We used a longitudinal mixed model analysis adjusting for age, sex and prior cardiovascular disease. In a secondary analysis we assessed a possible immediate treatment effect post baseline.

   RESULTS: Metformin did not affect NT-proBNP levels over time in the primary analysis (-1% [95%CI -4;3, p = 0.62]). In the secondary analysis there was also no sustained time independent immediate treatment effect (initial increase of 17% [95%CI 4;30, p = 0.006] followed by yearly decrease of -4% [95%CI -7;0, p = 0.07]).

   CONCLUSIONS: Metformin as compared to placebo did not affect NT-proBNP plasma levels in this 4.3-year placebo-controlled trial. Potential cardioprotective effects of metformin cannot be explained by changes in cardiac pressures or volumes to the extent reflected by NT-proBNP.

Abstract
  The aim of the study was to evaluate the overall biohumoral and metabolic effects of a 12-week add-on therapy consisting of a new nutraceutical formulation (BHC) based on berberine, hesperidin, and chromium picolinate in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) patients with suboptimal glycemic compensation receiving metformin. After 12 weeks, participants in the group receiving metformin plus BHC, compared to the group receiving metformin only, saw a significant improvement in their glucose profile, in terms of both glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and fasting blood glucose (FBG). Their FBG dropped from 145 +/- 20 mg/dL to 128 +/- 23 mg/dL (p < 0.01), a decrease of 11.7% compared with the baseline. This decrease differed significantly from the situation in the control arm (p < 0.05). HbA1c decreased by 7.5% from the baseline, from 53.5 +/- 4.3 mmol/mol to 49.5 +/- 5.1 mmol/mol (p < 0.01), in the group given BHC, while no difference was seen in the control group. Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were found to be significantly reduced (p < 0.01) only in the BHC group, from 9.34 +/- 7.61 mug/mL to 6.75 +/- 6.13 mug/mL, and from 1.7 +/- 0.15 mumol/L to 1.4 +/- 0.25 mumol/L, respectively. In patients with T2D taking metformin with suboptimal glycemic compensation, adding BHC for 3 months significantly improved glucose control in terms of FBG and HbA1c, and had a positive effect on the lipid peroxidation profile, as indicated by a decrease in AGEs and MDA.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To compare efficacy and safety of dulaglutide at doses of 3.0 and 4.5 mg versus 1.5 mg in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin.

   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to once-weekly dulaglutide 1.5 mg, 3.0 mg, or 4.5 mg for 52 weeks. The primary objective was determining superiority of dulaglutide 3.0 mg and/or 4.5 mg over 1.5 mg in HbA1c reduction at 36 weeks. Secondary superiority objectives included change in body weight. Two estimands addressed efficacy objectives: treatment regimen (regardless of treatment discontinuation or rescue medication) and efficacy (on treatment without rescue medication) in all randomly assigned patients.

   RESULTS: Mean baseline HbA1c and BMI in randomly assigned patients (N = 1,842) was 8.6% (70 mmol/mol) and 34.2 kg/m2, respectively. At 36 weeks, dulaglutide 4.5 mg provided superior HbA1c reductions compared with 1.5 mg (treatment-regimen estimand: -1.77 vs. -1.54% [-19.4 vs. -16.8 mmol/mol], estimated treatment difference [ETD] -0.24% (-2.6 mmol/mol), P < 0.001; efficacy estimand: -1.87 vs. -1.53% [-20.4 vs. -16.7 mmol/mol], ETD -0.34% (-3.7 mmol/mol), P < 0.001). Dulaglutide 3.0 mg was superior to 1.5 mg for reducing HbA1c, using the efficacy estimand (ETD -0.17% [-1.9 mmol/mol]; P = 0.003) but not the treatment-regimen estimand (ETD -0.10% [-1.1 mmol/mol]; P = 0.096). Dulaglutide 4.5 mg was superior to 1.5 mg for weight loss at 36 weeks for both estimands (treatment regimen: -4.6 vs. -3.0 kg, ETD -1.6 kg, P < 0.001; efficacy: -4.7 vs. -3.1 kg, ETD -1.6 kg, P < 0.001). Common adverse events through 36 weeks included nausea (1.5 mg, 13.4%; 3 mg, 15.6%; 4.5 mg, 16.4%) and vomiting (1.5 mg, 5.6%; 3 mg, 8.3%; 4.5 mg, 9.3%).

   CONCLUSIONS: In patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled by metformin, escalation from dulaglutide 1.5 mg to 3.0 mg or 4.5 mg provided clinically relevant, dose-related reductions in HbA1c and body weight with a similar safety profile.

Abstract
  Diabetes is a serious threat to global health and among the top 10 causes of death, with nearly half a billion people living with it worldwide. Treating patients with diabetes tend to become more challenging due to the progressive nature of the disease. The role and benefits of combination therapies for the management of type 2 diabetes are well-documented, while the comparative safety and efficacy among the different combination options have not been elucidated. We aimed to systematically synthesize the evidence on the comparative cardiovascular safety and efficacy of combination therapy with metformin-sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors versus metformin-sulfonylureas in patients with type 2 diabetes. We searched MEDLINE-PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov up to 15 August 2019 without restriction in the year of publication. We included randomized controlled trials of patients with type 2 diabetes who were on metformin-sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors or metformin-sulphonylureas combination therapy at least for a year. The primary endpoints were all-cause mortality and serious adverse events, and the secondary endpoints were cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, hypoglycemia, and changes in glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), body weight, fasting plasma glucose, blood pressure, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. We used a random-effects meta-analysis model to estimate mean differences for continuous outcomes and risk ratio for dichotomous outcomes. We followed PICOS description model for defining eligibility and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) 2015 guidelines for reporting results. Of 3,190 citations, we included nine trials involving 10,974 participants. The pooled analysis showed no significant difference in all-cause mortality (risk ration [RR] = 0.93, 95% CI [0.52, 1.67]), serious adverse events (RR = 0.96, 95% CI [0.79, 1.17]) and adverse events (RR = 1.00, 95% CI [0.99, 1.02]) between the two, but in hypoglycemia (RR = 0.13, 95% CI [0.10, 0.17], P < 0.001). Participants taking metformin-sodium glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors showed a significantly greater reduction in HbA1c (mean difference [MD] = - 0.10%, 95% CI [- 0.17, - 0.03], body weight (MD = - 4.57 kg, 95% CI [- 4.74, - 4.39], systolic blood pressure (MD = - 4.77 mmHg, 95% CI [- 5.39, - 4.16]), diastolic blood pressure (MD = - 2.07 mmHg, 95% CI [- 2.74, - 1.40], and fasting plasma glucose (MD = - 0.55 mmol/L, 95% CI [- 0.69, - 0.41]), p < 0.001. Combination therapy of metformin and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors is a safe and efficacious alternative to combination therapy of metformin and sulphonylureas for patients with type 2 diabetes who are at risk of cardiovascular comorbidity. However, there remains a need for additional long-term randomized controlled trials as available studies are very limited and heterogeneous.

Abstract
  Background: Asthma and diabetes are both diseases that affect a wide range of people worldwide. As a common treatment for diabetes, metformin has also been reported to be effective in improving asthma outcomes. We conducted a combined analysis to examine the efficacy of metformin in reducing asthma exacerbation in patients with concurrent asthma and diabetes.

   Methods: We searched the PubMed, Embase, and CENTRAL databases for articles published prior to April 2020 to find observational studies of individuals with concurrent asthma and diabetes that compared the risk of asthma exacerbation between metformin users and nonusers. Two researchers separately screened the studies, extracted data, and evaluated the risk of bias. The primary outcome was the adjusted risk of asthma exacerbation. The secondary outcomes were the adjusted risk of asthma-related hospitalization and emergency room visits. Review Manager was used for data analysis and plotting. I 2 and chi 2 tests were used to estimate heterogeneity. A random effects or fixed effects model was used depending on the heterogeneity. Odds ratios were calculated for dichotomous variables.

   Results: We included two studies with a total of 25252 patients. The pooled effect size showed that metformin was inversely associated with a risk of asthma exacerbation (OR = 0.65, 95% CI 0.28-1.48; chi 2 = 5.42, P=0.02; I 2 = 82%), asthma-related emergency department visits (OR = 0.81, 95% CI 0.74-0.89; chi 2 = 0.36, P=0.55; I 2 = 0%), and hospitalizations (OR = 0.43, 95% CI 0.14-1.29; chi 2 = 4.01, P=0.05; I 2 = 75%).

   Conclusion: This meta-analysis suggested that metformin decreased the risk of asthma-related emergency room visits for patients with concurrent asthma and diabetes. Metformin reduced the risk of asthma-related hospitalization and exacerbation but was not statistically significant. More randomized trials involving larger samples should be considered, and the mechanisms of these effects need to be fully elucidated. Copyright © 2020 Li Wen et al.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence indicates that metformin has anti-inflammatory effect; however, the results differ concerning randomized controlled trails of the effect of metformin on inflammatory markers in type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients.

   OBJECTIVE: This study reassessed the data on the effect of metformin treatment on inflammatory markers in T2D patients through a systematic review and meta-analysis.

   METHODS: A systematic search was performed in the PubMed, ISI Web of Science, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and Scopus databases to collect relevant published data up to September 2020. Data of each study was combined using random-effects model. Subgroup analysis was performed based on subgroups of the treatment duration, dose and target population.

   RESULTS: Thirteen RCTs including 1776 participants with T2D were analyzed. Although CRP levels significantly decreased [SMD: -0.76 mg/L; 95% CI (-1.48, -0.049); P = 0.036] in patients with T2D following metformin treatment, circulating levels of TNF-alpha [SMD: -0.17 pg/mL; 95% CI (-0.55, 0.20); P = 0.37] and IL-6 [SMD: -0.06 pg/mL; 95% CI (-0.38, 0.25); P = 0.69] were insignificant after metformin treatment. Compared to treatment duration of less than 24 weeks, longer treatment duration (more than 24 weeks) was associated with reduced level of CRP.

   RELEVANCE TO PATIENT CARE AND CLINICAL PRACTICE: Based on available evidence from RCTs in this meta-analysis, metformin decreased CRP level. However, strategies for the treatment of inflammation should focus on metformin in patients with T2D.

   CONCLUSION: The present study evidences that therapy with metformin can reduce CRP level significantly in T2D patients compared to other inflammatory markers.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Metformin has been shown to have both neuroprotective and neurodegenerative effects. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of metformin in combination with insulin on cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN) and distal peripheral neuropathy (DPN) in individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2DM).

   METHODS: The study is a sub-study of the CIMT trial, a randomized placebo-controlled trial with a 2 x 3 factorial design, where 412 patients with T2DM were randomized to 18 months of metformin or placebo in addition to open-labelled insulin. Outcomes were measures of CAN: Changes in heart rate response to deep breathing (beat-to-beat), orthostatic blood pressure (OBP) and heart rate and vibration detection threshold (VDT) as a marker DPN. Serum levels of vitamin B12 and methyl malonic acid (MMA) were analysed.

   RESULTS: After 18 months early drop in OBP (30 s after standing) was increased in the metformin group compared to placebo: systolic blood pressure drop increased by 3.4 mmHg (95% CI 0.6; 6.2, p = 0.02) and diastolic blood pressure drop increased by 1.3 mmHg (95% CI 0.3; 2.6, p = 0.045) compared to placebo. Beat-to-beat variation decreased in the metformin group by 1.1 beats per minute (95% CI - 2.4; 0.2, p = 0.10). Metformin treatment did not affect VDT group difference - 0.33 V (95% CI - 1.99; 1.33, p = 0.39) or other outcomes. Changes in B12, MMA and HbA1c did not confound the associations.

   CONCLUSIONS: Eighteen months of metformin treatment in combination with insulin compared with insulin alone increased early drop in OBP indicating an adverse effect of metformin on CAN independent of vitamin B12, MMA HbA1c. Trial registration The protocol was approved by the Regional Committee on Biomedical Research Ethics (H-D-2007-112), the Danish Medicines Agency and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00657943).

Abstract
  PURPOSE: Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in more than half of intensive care unit patients. Effective prevention and treatment strategies for AKI remain limited. We aimed to assess AKI-related mortality in patients with diabetes who were metformin and non-metformin users.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: We included patients with AKI and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care database. The 30-day mortality, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, and length of hospital stay were compared between patients with and without metformin prescriptions. We used multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression, propensity score analysis, and an inverse probability-weighting model to ensure the robustness of our findings.

   RESULTS: We included 4328 patients with AKI and T2DM (998 and 3330 patients were metformin and non-metformin users, respectively). The overall 30-day mortality was 14.2% (613/4328); it was 15.7% (523/3330) and 9.0% (90/998) for non-metformin and metformin users, respectively. In the inverse probability-weighting model, metformin use was associated with 37% lower 30-day mortality (HR = 0.63, 95% CI: 0.50-0.80, p < 0.0001).

   CONCLUSIONS: Metformin use may be associated with reduced risk-adjusted mortality in patients with AKI and T2DM. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to clarify this association. Copyright © 2021. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Abstract
  With worsening epidemiological trends for both the incidence and prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and heart failure (HF) worldwide, it is critical to implement optimal prevention and treatment strategies for patients with these comorbidities, either alone or concomitantly. Several guidelines and consensus statements have recommended glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 inhibitors as add-ons to lifestyle interventions with or without metformin in those at high atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk. However, these recommendations are either silent about HF or fail to differentiate between the prevention of HF in those at risk versus the treatment of individuals with manifest HF. Furthermore, these documents do not differentiate among those with different HF phenotypes. This distinction, even though important, may not be critical for sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 inhibitors in view of the consistent data for benefit for both atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease- and HF-related outcomes that have emerged from the regulatory-mandated cardiovascular outcome trials for all sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 inhibitors and the recent DAPA-HF trial (Dapagliflozin in Patients with Heart Failure and Reduced Ejection Fraction)demonstrating the benefit of dapagliflozin on HF-related outcomes in patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction with or without T2DM. However, the distinction may be crucial for glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and other antihyperglycemic agents. Indeed, in several of the new statements, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists are suggested treatment not only for patients with T2DM and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, but also in those with manifest HF, despite a lack of evidence for the latter recommendation. Although glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists may be appropriate to use in patients at risk for HF, mechanistic insights and observations from randomized trials suggest no clear benefit on HF-related outcomes and even uncertainty regarding the safety in those with HF with reduced ejection fraction. Conversely, theoretical rationales suggest that these agents may benefit patients with HF with preserved ejection fraction. Considering that millions of patients with T2DM have HF, these concerns have public health implications that necessitate the thoughtful use of these therapies. Achieving this aim will require dedicated trials with these drugs in both patients who have HF with reduced ejection fraction and HF with preserved ejection fraction with T2DM to assess their efficacy, safety, and risk-benefit profile.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Semaglutide is an effective treatment for type 2 diabetes; however, 20-30% of patients given semaglutide 1.0 mg do not reach glycaemic treatment goals. We aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of once-weekly semaglutide 2.0 mg versus 1.0 mg in adults with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes on a stable dose of metformin with or without a sulfonylurea.

   METHODS: We did a 40-week, randomised, active-controlled, parallel-group, double-blind, phase 3B trial (SUSTAIN FORTE) at 125 outpatient clinics in ten countries. Participants (>=18 years) with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes (HbA1c 8.0-10.0%) with metformin and with or without sulfonylurea were randomly assigned (1:1) by an interactive web-response system to 2.0 mg or 1.0 mg once-weekly semaglutide. Participants , site personnel, the clinical study group, and investigators were masked to the randomised treatment. Outcomes included change from baseline at week 40 in HbA1c (primary outcome) and bodyweight (secondary confirmatory outcome), evaluated through trial product estimand (no treatment discontinuation or without rescue medication) and treatment policy estimand (regardless of treatment discontinuation or rescue medication) strategies. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03989232; EudraCT, 2018-004529-96; and WHO, U1111-1224-5162.

   FINDINGS: Between June 19 and Nov 28, 2019, of 1515 adults assessed for eligibility, 961 participants (mean age 58.0 years [SD 10.0]; 398 [41%] women) were included. Participants were randomly assigned to once-weekly semaglutide 2.0 mg (n=480 [50%]) or 1.0 mg (n=481 [50%]); 462 (96%) patients in the semaglutide 2.0 mg group and 471 (98%) in the semaglutide 1.0 mg group completed the trial. Mean baseline HbA1c was 8.9% (SD 0.6; 73.3 mmol/mol [SD 6.9]) and BMI was 34.6 kg/m2 (SD 7.0). Mean change in HbA1c from baseline at week 40 was -2.2 percentage points with semaglutide 2.0 mg and -1.9 percentage points with semaglutide 1.0 mg (estimated treatment difference [ETD] -0.23 percentage points [95% CI -0.36 to -0.11]; p=0.0003; trial product estimand) and -2.1 percentage points with semaglutide 2.0 mg and -1.9 percentage points with semaglutide 1.0 mg (ETD -0.18 percentage points [-0.31 to -0.04]; p=0.0098; treatment policy estimand). Mean change in bodyweight from baseline at week 40 was -6.9 kg with semaglutide 2.0 mg and -6.0 kg with semaglutide 1.0 mg (ETD -0.93 kg [95% CI -1.68 to -0.18]; p=0.015; trial product estimand) and -6.4 kg with semaglutide 2.0 mg and -5.6 kg with semaglutide 1.0 mg (ETD -0.77 kg [-1.55 to 0.01]; p=0.054; treatment policy estimand). Gastrointestinal disorders were the most commonly reported adverse events (163 [34%] in the 2.0 mg group and 148 [31%] in the 1.0 mg group). Serious adverse events were similar between treatment groups, reported for 21 (4%) participants given semaglutide 2.0 mg and 25 (5%) participants given semaglutide 1.0 mg. Three deaths were reported during the trial (one in the semaglutide 1.0 mg group and two in the semaglutide 2.0 mg group).

   INTERPRETATION: Semaglutide 2.0 mg was superior to 1.0 mg in reducing HbA1c, with additional bodyweight loss and a similar safety profile. This higher dose provides a treatment intensification option for patients with type 2 diabetes treated with semaglutide in need of additional glycaemic control.

Abstract
  Some studies indicate potential beneficial effects of metformin on body composition and bone. This trial compared metformin + insulin vs placebo + insulin. Metformin treatment had a small but positive effect on bone quality in the peripheral skeleton, reduced weight gain, and resulted in a more beneficial body composition compared with placebo in insulin-treated patients with type 2 diabetes.

   INTRODUCTION: Glucose-lowering medications affect body composition. We assessed the long-term effects of metformin compared with placebo on whole body bone and body composition measures in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

   METHODS: This was a sub-study of the Copenhagen Insulin and Metformin Therapy trial, which was a double-blinded randomized placebo-controlled trial assessing 18-month treatment with metformin compared with placebo, in combination with different insulin regimens in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The sub-study evaluates the effects on bone mineral content (BMC), density (BMD), and body composition from whole body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans which were assessed at baseline and after 18 months.

   RESULTS: Metformin had a small, but positive, (p < 0.05) effect on subtotal, appendicular, and legs BMC and BMD compared with placebo. After adjustment for sex, age, vitamin D, smoking, BMI, T2DM duration, HbA1c, and insulin dose, the effects on appendicular BMC and BMD persisted (p < 0.05 for both). The changes in appendicular BMC and BMD corresponded approximately to a 0.7% and 0.5% increase in the metformin group and 0.4% and 0.4% decrease in the placebo group, respectively. These effects were mostly driven by an increase in BMC and BMD in the legs and a loss of BMC and BMD in the arms. During 18 months, all participants increased in weight, fat mass (FM), FM%, and lean mass (LM), but decreased in LM%. The metformin group increased less in weight (subtotal weight (weight-head) - 2.4 [- 3.5, - 1.4] kg, p value < 0.001) and FM (- 1.5 [- 2.3, - 0.8] kg, p value < 0.001) and decreased less in LM% (0.6 [0.2, 1.1] %, p value < 0.001) compared with the placebo group.

   CONCLUSION: Metformin treatment had a small positive effect on BMC and BMD in the peripheral skeleton and reduced weight gain compared with placebo in insulin-treated patients with T2DM. Copyright © 2021. International Osteoporosis Foundation and National Osteoporosis Foundation.

Abstract
  The biguanide metformin has been safely and widely used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus for decades. Preclinical studies have suggested that it may have a role in slowing disease progression in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. In this issue, Perrone et al. report results from the Trial of Administration of Metformin in PKD (TAME PKD) study, a phase 2 randomized controlled trial investigating the safety and tolerability of metformin in patients in the early stages of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. We discuss the implications of these findings and how they relate to a major phase 3 trial in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease that will start later in 2021. Crown Copyright © 2021.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Tirzepatide is a dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist that is under development for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The efficacy and safety of once-weekly tirzepatide as compared with semaglutide, a selective GLP-1 receptor agonist, are unknown.

   METHODS: In an open-label, 40-week, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned 1879 patients, in a 1:1:1:1 ratio, to receive tirzepatide at a dose of 5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg or semaglutide at a dose of 1 mg. At baseline, the mean glycated hemoglobin level was 8.28%, the mean age 56.6 years, and the mean weight 93.7 kg. The primary end point was the change in the glycated hemoglobin level from baseline to 40 weeks.

   RESULTS: The estimated mean change from baseline in the glycated hemoglobin level was -2.01 percentage points, -2.24 percentage points, and -2.30 percentage points with 5 mg, 10 mg, and 15 mg of tirzepatide, respectively, and -1.86 percentage points with semaglutide; the estimated differences between the 5-mg, 10-mg, and 15-mg tirzepatide groups and the semaglutide group were -0.15 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI], -0.28 to -0.03; P = 0.02), -0.39 percentage points (95% CI, -0.51 to -0.26; P<0.001), and -0.45 percentage points (95% CI, -0.57 to -0.32; P<0.001), respectively. Tirzepatide at all doses was noninferior and superior to semaglutide. Reductions in body weight were greater with tirzepatide than with semaglutide (least-squares mean estimated treatment difference, -1.9 kg, -3.6 kg, and -5.5 kg, respectively; P<0.001 for all comparisons). The most common adverse events were gastrointestinal and were primarily mild to moderate in severity in the tirzepatide and semaglutide groups (nausea, 17 to 22% and 18%; diarrhea, 13 to 16% and 12%; and vomiting, 6 to 10% and 8%, respectively). Of the patients who received tirzepatide, hypoglycemia (blood glucose level, <54 mg per deciliter) was reported in 0.6% (5-mg group), 0.2% (10-mg group), and 1.7% (15-mg group); hypoglycemia was reported in 0.4% of those who received semaglutide. Serious adverse events were reported in 5 to 7% of the patients who received tirzepatide and in 3% of those who received semaglutide.

   CONCLUSIONS: In patients with type 2 diabetes, tirzepatide was noninferior and superior to semaglutide with respect to the mean change in the glycated hemoglobin level from baseline to 40 weeks.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To compare the long-term efficacy of initiating therapy with metformin/pioglitazone/exenatide in patients with new-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) versus sequential addition of metformin followed by glipizide and insulin.

   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Drug-naive patients (N = 318) with new-onset T2DM were randomly assigned to receive for 3 years either 1) combination therapy with metformin, pioglitazone, and exenatide (triple therapy) or 2) sequential addition of metformin followed by glipizide and insulin (conventional therapy) to maintain HbA1c at <6.5% (48 mmol/mol). Insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function were measured at baseline and 3 years. The primary outcome was the difference in HbA1c between the groups at 3 years.

   RESULTS: Baseline HbA1c +/- SEM values were 9.0% +/- 0.2% and 8.9% +/- 0.2% in the triple therapy and conventional therapy groups, respectively. The decrease in HbA1c resulting from triple therapy was greater at 6 months than that produced by conventional therapy (0.30% [95% CI 0.21-0.39]; P = 0.001), and the HbA1c reduction was maintained at 3 years in patients receiving triple therapy compared with conventional therapy (6.4% +/- 0.1% and 6.9% +/- 0.1%, respectively), despite intensification of antihyperglycemic therapy in the latter. Thus, the difference in HbA1c between the two treatment groups at 3 years was 0.50% (95% CI 0.39-0.61; P < 0.0001). Triple therapy produced a threefold increase in insulin sensitivity and 30-fold increase in beta-cell function. In conventional therapy, insulin sensitivity did not change and beta-cell function increased by only 34% (both P < 0.0001 vs. triple therapy).

   CONCLUSIONS: Triple therapy with agents that improve insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function in patients with new-onset T2DM produces greater, more durable HbA1c reduction than agents that lower glucose levels without correcting the underlying metabolic defects.

Abstract
  Agonism of the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) results in glycemic lowering and body weight loss and is a therapeutic strategy to treat type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity. We developed danuglipron (PF-06882961), an oral small-molecule GLP-1R agonist and found it had comparable efficacy to injectable peptidic GLP-1R agonists in a humanized mouse model. We then completed a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, multiple ascending-dose phase 1 study ( NCT03538743 ), in which we enrolled 98 patients with T2D on background metformin and randomized them to receive multiple ascending doses of danuglipron or placebo for 28 d, across eight cohorts. The primary outcomes were assessment of adverse events (AEs), safety laboratory tests, vital signs and 12-lead electrocardiograms. Most AEs were mild, with nausea, dyspepsia and vomiting most commonly reported. There were no clinically meaningful AEs in laboratory values across groups. Heart rate generally increased with danuglipron treatment at day 28, but no heart-rate AEs were reported. Systolic blood pressure was slightly decreased and changes in diastolic blood pressure were similar with danuglipron treatment at day 28, compared with placebo. There were no clinically meaningful electrocardiogram findings. In this study in T2D, danuglipron was generally well tolerated, with a safety profile consistent with the mechanism of action of GLP-1R agonism.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND & AIMS: Guidelines for reducing postprandial blood glucose concentrations include avoiding high glycemic index (GI) foods, such as white potatoes. However, GI testing is often undertaken in the morning with foods consumed in isolation by non-clinical cohorts. We investigated the impact of potato preparation and consumption as part of a mixed-evening meal on postprandial and nocturnal glycemic responses, and postprandial insulin response, in individuals with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM).

   METHODS: In a randomized, cross-over design, 24 males and females (age 58.3 +/- 9.3 y; BMI: 31.7 +/- 6.8 kg/m2) with T2DM (diet or metformin controlled) completed four experimental trials after consuming a standardized breakfast (25% daily energy intake (EI)) and lunch (35% EI). Dinner (40% EI) was consumed at 1800 h being either: 1) boiled potato (BOIL); 2) roasted potato (ROAST); 3) boiled potato cooled for 24 h (COOLED); or 4) basmati rice (CONTROL). Each meal contained 50% carbohydrate, 30% fat and 20% protein. Blood samples were collected prior to, immediately post meal and at 30-min intervals for a further 120 min. A continuous glucose monitor was worn to assess nocturnal interstitial glucose concentrations.

   RESULTS: No differences were detected in postprandial venous glucose area under the curve (iAUC) between CONTROL and all three potato conditions. Postprandial insulin iAUC was greater following COOLED compared to CONTROL (P = 0.003; 95% CI: 18.9-111.72 miU/mL). No significant differences between CONTROL and BOIL or ROAST were detected for postprandial insulin concentrations. All potato meals resulted in lower nocturnal glucose AUC than CONTROL (P < 0.001; 95% CI 4.15-15.67 mmol/L x h).

   CONCLUSION: Compared to an isoenergetic rice meal, boiled, roasted or boiled then cooled potato-based meals were not associated with unfavourable postprandial glucose responses or nocturnal glycemic control, and can be considered suitable for individuals with T2DM when consumed as part of a mixed-evening meal.

Abstract
  AIMS/INTRODUCTION: To assess the efficacy and safety of metformin/sitagliptin-based dual/triple therapy in elderly Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: This subgroup analysis included individuals aged >=65 years from the STRATEGY study, a two-stage study in which type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with unsatisfactory glycemic control on metformin were first treated with the dual combination of metformin and sitagliptin for 16 weeks (n = 681), and then, if glycemic control had not been achieved, were treated with a third add-on oral antihyperglycemic drug for another 24 weeks (n = 291). The efficacy end-point was change in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in each stage, and the safety end-point was adverse events with a focus on hypoglycemia.

   RESULTS: At week 16, the change in HbA1c was -0.81% from baseline, and the percentages of patients who achieved HbA1c targets of <7% and <7.5% were 44.9 and 67.2%, respectively. After 24 weeks, a further average HbA1c reduction of -0.60% was observed with specific reductions of -0.70% with glimepiride, -0.63% with gliclazide, -0.51% with repaglinide and -0.45% with acarbose. The proportions of patients who achieved HbA1c targets of <7% and <7.5% were 65.4 and 81.3%, respectively, over the entire study. The rates of drug-related adverse events and hypoglycemia were, respectively, 4.1 and 4.3% in the dual therapy stage, and 5.2% and 7.1% in the triple therapy stage, without occurrence of severe hypoglycemia.

   CONCLUSIONS: In elderly Chinese type 2 diabetes mellitus patients, metformin/sitagliptin-based dual and triple oral therapy can provide clinically meaningful glycemic control and is generally well tolerated with a low incidence of hypoglycemia.

  BACKGROUND: The prevalence of type 2 diabetes in youth is increasing, but little is known regarding the occurrence of related complications as these youths transition to adulthood.

   METHODS: We previously conducted a multicenter clinical trial (from 2004 to 2011) to evaluate the effects of one of three treatments (metformin, metformin plus rosiglitazone, or metformin plus an intensive lifestyle intervention) on the time to loss of glycemic control in participants who had onset of type 2 diabetes in youth. After completion of the trial, participants were transitioned to metformin with or without insulin and were enrolled in an observational follow-up study (performed from 2011 to 2020), which was conducted in two phases; the results of this follow-up study are reported here. Assessments for diabetic kidney disease, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and nerve disease were performed annually, and assessments for retinal disease were performed twice. Complications related to diabetes identified outside the study were confirmed and adjudicated.

   RESULTS: At the end of the second phase of the follow-up study (January 2020), the mean (+/-SD) age of the 500 participants who were included in the analyses was 26.4+/-2.8 years, and the mean time since the diagnosis of diabetes was 13.3+/-1.8 years. The cumulative incidence of hypertension was 67.5%, the incidence of dyslipidemia was 51.6%, the incidence of diabetic kidney disease was 54.8%, and the incidence of nerve disease was 32.4%. The prevalence of retinal disease, including more advanced stages, was 13.7% in the period from 2010 to 2011 and 51.0% in the period from 2017 to 2018. At least one complication occurred in 60.1% of the participants, and at least two complications occurred in 28.4%. Risk factors for the development of complications included minority race or ethnic group, hyperglycemia, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. No adverse events were recorded during follow-up.

   CONCLUSIONS: Among participants who had onset of type 2 diabetes in youth, the risk of complications, including microvascular complications, increased steadily over time and affected most participants by the time of young adulthood. Complications were more common among participants of minority race and ethnic group and among those with hyperglycemia, hypertension, and dyslipidemia.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: Across the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) follow-up, cumulative diabetes incidence remained lower in the lifestyle compared with the placebo and metformin randomized groups and could not be explained by weight. Collection of self-reported physical activity (PA) (yearly) with cross-sectional objective PA (in follow-up) allowed for examination of PA and its long-term impact on diabetes prevention.

   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Yearly self-reported PA and diabetes assessment and oral glucose tolerance test results (fasting glucose semiannually) were collected for 3,232 participants with one accelerometry assessment 11-13 years after randomization (n = 1,793). Mixed models determined PA differences across treatment groups. The association between PA and diabetes incidence was examined using Cox proportional hazards models.

   RESULTS: There was a 6% decrease (Cox proportional hazard ratio 0.94 [95% CI 0.92, 0.96]; P < 0.001) in diabetes incidence per 6 MET-h/week increase in time-dependent PA for the entire cohort over an average of 12 years (controlled for age, sex, baseline PA, and weight). The effect of PA was greater (12% decrease) among participants less active at baseline (<7.5 MET-h/week) (n = 1,338) (0.88 [0.83, 0.93]; P < 0.0001), with stronger findings for lifestyle participants. Lifestyle had higher cumulative PA compared with metformin or placebo (P < 0.0001) and higher accelerometry total minutes per day measured during follow-up (P = 0.001 and 0.047). All associations remained significant with the addition of weight in the models.

   CONCLUSIONS: PA was inversely related to incident diabetes in the entire cohort across the study, with cross-sectional accelerometry results supporting these findings. This highlights the importance of PA within lifestyle intervention efforts designed to prevent diabetes and urges health care providers to consider both PA and weight when counseling high-risk patients.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: The Treatment Options for type 2 Diabetes in Adolescents and Youth (TODAY) trial demonstrated that glycemic failure rates were significantly lower in youth randomized to metformin plus rosiglitazone treatment than in youth randomized to metformin alone or metformin plus intensive lifestyle intervention. At the end of the study, rosiglitazone was permanently discontinued, and routine diabetes care resumed. Herein, we report postintervention glycemic failure rates in TODAY participants over an additional 36 months of follow-up for the three original treatment arms and describe insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function outcomes.

   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 699 participants were randomized during TODAY, of whom 572 enrolled in the TODAY2 observational follow-up. Glycemic failure was defined as HbA1c >=8% over a 6-month period, inability to wean from temporary insulin therapy within 3 months after acute metabolic decompensation during TODAY, or sustained HbA1c >=8% over two consecutive visits during TODAY2. Oral glucose tolerance tests were conducted, and insulin sensitivity, insulinogenic index, and oral disposition index were calculated.

   RESULTS: During the 36 months of TODAY2, glycemic failure rates did not differ among participants by original treatment group assignment. Insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function deteriorated rapidly during the 36 months of TODAY2 routine diabetes care but did not differ by treatment group assignment.

   CONCLUSIONS: The added benefit of preventing glycemic failure by using rosiglitazone as a second agent in youth-onset type 2 diabetes did not persist after its discontinuation. More work is needed to address this rapid progression to avoid long-term diabetes complications. Copyright © 2020 by the American Diabetes Association.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: The pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in youth differs from adults and conventional medical treatment approaches with lifestyle change, metformin, thiazolidinediones or insulin are inadequate. Metabolic bariatric surgery (MBS) improves multiple health outcomes in adults with T2D. Initial small, uncontrolled studies of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass have also suggested beneficial effects in adolescents. Definitive studies in youth with T2D are lacking, especially with the now more common form of MBS, vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG). The surgical or medical treatment for paediatric type 2 diabetes (ST2OMP) clinical trial was designed to test the hypothesis that VSG will more effectively reduce hyperglycaemic and diabetes comorbidities than the best currently available medical treatment incorporating state of the art pharmacotherapies. ST2OMP is also designed to better understand the pancreatic and enterohepatic mechanisms by which MBS improves diabetes and its associated comorbidities.

   METHODS AND ANALYSIS: ST2OMP is a prospective, open-label, controlled clinical trial that will recruit 90 postpubertal participants, age range 13-19.9 years, with body mass index >=35 kg/m2 or >120% of 95th percentile and youth-onset T2D. The primary outcome is the per cent of youth achieving haemoglobin A1c <6.0% at 12 months postgroup allocation (post-VSG vs postmedical group allocation). Secondary outcomes include remission of comorbidities and measures of beta-cell and incretin responses at 12 and 24 months post VSG versus AMT.

   ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The ST2OMP protocol was approved by the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center and the University of Colorado Institutional Review Boards. Written informed consent is obtained prior to study enrolment. Study findings will be widely disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Frailty is a geriatric syndrome of decreased physiologic reserve and resistance to stressors that results in increased vulnerability to adverse health outcomes with aging. Diabetes and hyperglycemia are established risk factors for frailty. We sought to examine whether the odds of frailty among individuals at high risk of diabetes randomized to treatment with intensive lifestyle (ILS), metformin, or placebo differed after long-term follow-up.

   METHOD: The sample comprised participants in the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) clinical trial, who continued follow-up in the DPP Outcomes Study (DPPOS) and completed frailty assessments in DPPOS Years 8 (n = 2385) and 10 (n = 2289), approximately 12 and 14 years after DPP randomization. Frailty was classified using Fried Frailty Phenotype criteria. GEE models adjusting for visit year with repeated measures pooled for Years 8 and 10 were used to estimate pairwise odds ratios (ORs) between ILS, metformin, and placebo for the outcomes of frail and prefrail versus nonfrail.

   RESULTS: Frailty prevalence by treatment group was ILS = 3.0%, metformin = 5.4%, placebo = 5.7% at Year 8, and ILS = 3.6%, metformin = 5.3%, placebo = 5.4% at Year 10. Odds ratios (95% CI) estimated with GEE models were ILS versus placebo, 0.62 (0.42-0.93), p = .022; metformin versus placebo, 0.99 (0.69-1.42), p = .976; and ILS versus metformin, 0.63 (0.42-0.94), p = .022. Odds of being frail versus nonfrail were 37% lower for ILS compared to metformin and placebo.

   CONCLUSIONS: Early ILS intervention, at an average age of about 50 years, in persons at high risk of diabetes may reduce frailty prevalence in later life. Metformin may be ineffective in reducing frailty prevalence.

Abstract
  Background: Acarbose (ACA) can effectively reduce the postprandial blood glucose and has similar antidiabetic effects as metformin (MET). To our knowledge, few studies have compared the effect of ACA or MET on glucose fluctuations. In the present study, we explored the effect of ACA or MET combined with premixed insulin (INS) on glycemic control and glycemic variability (GV). Methods: This was an open-label randomized trial that was conducted in type 2 diabetic patients taking premixed insulin. The patients were assigned to 12 weeks of MET (n = 62) or ACA (n = 62) treatment combined with INS. The main outcomes were changes in GV and glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) compared with baseline. Results: Compared with baseline, several GV indices (standard deviation [SD], mean amplitude of glycemic excursions [MAGE]) and blood glucose control indices (mean glucose [MG], time in range [TIR] and HbA1c) were both significantly improved in INS+ACA and INS+MET after 12-week therapy. However, coefficient of variation (CV) was significantly reduced in INS+ACA but not in INS+MET. Moreover, compared with INS+MET, INS+ACA led to a more pronounced percentage change from baseline in CV (26.3% [1.7%-44.6%] vs. 11.9% [-7.0% to 29.9%], P = 0.022), MAGE (40.5% [20.1%-60.5%] vs. 25.2% [-2.1% to 43.4%], P = 0.007) and SD (38.6% [25.2%-57.9%] vs. 30.1% [10.8%-46.5%], P = 0.041). Conclusion:  Both MET and ACE combined with INS effectively reduced blood glucose. Compared with MET, ACA combined with INS reduced GV.

Abstract
  AIM: To compare the effects of glucose-lowering drugs on body weight and blood pressure in adults with type 2 diabetes.

   METHODS: We searched Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and grey literature sources until 29 September 2020 for randomized controlled trials of at least 24 weeks' duration assessing the effects of glucose-lowering drugs on body weight and blood pressure in adults with type 2 diabetes. We performed frequentist network meta-analyses and calculated weighted mean differences and 95% confidence intervals combining trial arms of different approved doses of a given intervention into a single group. We evaluated the confidence in pooled estimates using the CINeMA (Confidence In Network Meta-Analysis) framework.

   RESULTS: In total, 424 trials (276 336 patients) assessing 21 antidiabetic medications from nine drug classes were included. Subcutaneous semaglutide was the most efficacious in reducing body weight followed by oral semaglutide, exenatide twice-daily, liraglutide, and the sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors empagliflozin, canagliflozin, dapagliflozin and ertugliflozin. The same agents also conferred the greatest reductions in systolic blood pressure. Metformin had a modest effect in reducing body weight and systolic blood pressure. Diastolic blood pressure was reduced with the SGLT-2 inhibitors pioglitazone, exenatide twice-daily and semaglutide. In subgroup analyses of trials with over 52 weeks' duration, semaglutide and SGLT-2 inhibitors reduced both body weight and systolic blood pressure.

   CONCLUSIONS: Semaglutide and SGLT-2 inhibitors conferred reductions both in body weight and blood pressure that were sustainable for over 1 year of treatment. These agents may be preferable treatment options for patients with type 2 diabetes who are overweight/obese and/or hypertensive. Copyright © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Abstract
  AIMS: To assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of ipragliflozin 50 mg once daily added to sitagliptin 50 mg once daily monotherapy in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D).

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: The results of two clinical trials are reported. In both trials, patients had glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels of 7.0% to 10.0% on sitagliptin 50 mg once daily 2 weeks prior to addition of ipragliflozin or placebo. In one trial (Trial 843), patients were randomized 1:1 to addition of blinded ipragliflozin 50 mg once daily (n = 73) or placebo (n = 70) for 24 weeks; the primary endpoint was efficacy (change in HbA1c at Week 24). In the other trial (Trial 849), open-label ipragliflozin 50 mg once daily was added for 52 weeks (n = 77); the primary objective was to assess safety/tolerability.

   RESULTS: In Trial 843, baseline characteristics were similar between groups (mean age 60.5 years, HbA1c 8.0%); after 24 weeks, adding ipragliflozin provided significantly greater reduction in HbA1c compared to placebo: least squares mean difference -0.77% (95% confidence interval -0.98, -0.57; P <0.001). In Trial 843, the incidences of adverse events (AEs) overall and prespecified AEs of clinical interest (symptomatic hypoglycaemia, urinary tract infection, genital infection, hypovolaemia, and polyuria/pollakiuria) were similar between groups. In Trial 849, specific AEs with incidence >=5% were nasopharyngitis, pollakiuria, back pain, thirst, constipation, influenza and arthralgia; drug-related AEs reported in >=2 patients were pollakiuria, thirst and constipation.

   CONCLUSIONS: Ipragliflozin 50 mg once daily added on to sitagliptin 50 mg once daily monotherapy provided significant improvement in glycaemic control and was generally well tolerated in Japanese patients with T2D.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: Many patients with type 2 diabetes treated with premixed insulin gradually have inadequate glycemic control and switch to a basal-bolus regimen, which raises some concerns for weight gain and increased hypoglycemic risk. Switching to combination use of glp-1 agonist and basal insulin may be an alternative option.

   METHODS: After a 12-week premixed human insulin 70/30 dosage optimization period, 200 patients with HbA1c of 7.0% to 10.0% were randomized into 24-week treatment groups with exenatide twice a day plus glargine or with aspart 70/30 twice a day.

   RESULTS: After 24 weeks, the patients receiving exenatide plus glargine (n = 90) had improved HbA1c control compared with those receiving aspart 70/30 (n = 90) (least squares mean change: -0.59 vs -0.13%; difference [95% CI]: -0.45 [-0.74 to -0.17]) in the full analysis set population. Weight decreased 3.5 kg with exenatide and decreased 0.4 kg with aspart 70/30 (P < .001). The insulin dose was reduced 10.7 units/day (95% CI, -12.2 to -9.2 units; P < .001) with exenatide, and increased 9.7 units/day (95% CI, 8.2 to 11.2 units; P < .001) with aspart 70/30. The most common adverse events were gastrointestinal adverse effects in the exenatide group (nausea [21%], vomiting [16%], diarrhea [13%]). The incidence of hypoglycemia was similar in 2 groups (27% for exenatide and 38% for aspart 70/30; P = .1).

   CONCLUSION: In premixed human insulin-treated patients with type 2 diabetes with inadequate glycemic control, switching to exenatide twice a day plus glargine was superior to aspart 70/30 twice a day for glycemic and weight control.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Community-based diabetes prevention programs varied widely in effectiveness, and the intervention strategy consisting of lifestyle interventions, stepwise addition of metformin, and financial incentives has not been studied in real-world clinical practice settings. The Pre-Diabetes Interventions and Continued Tracking to Ease-out Diabetes (Pre-DICTED) trial is a pragmatic trial that aims to compare the effectiveness of a community-based stepwise diabetes prevention program with added financial incentives (intervention) versus the standard of care (control) in reducing the risk of type 2 diabetes over 3 years among overweight or obese individuals with pre-diabetes.

   METHODS: This is an open-label, 1:1 randomized controlled trial which aims to recruit 846 adult individuals with isolated impaired fasting glucose (IFG), isolated impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), or both IFG and IGT from Singapore. Intervention arm participants attend 12 group-based sessions (2 nutrition workshops, 9 exercise sessions, and a goal-setting workshop) delivered at community sites (weeks 1 to 6), receive weekly physical activity and nutrition recommendations delivered by printed worksheets (weeks 7 to 12), and receive monthly health tips delivered by text messages (months 4 to 36). From month 6 onwards, intervention arm participants who remain at the highest risk of conversion to diabetes are prescribed metformin. Intervention arm participants are also eligible for a payment/rewards program with incentives tied to attendance at the group sessions and achievement of the weight loss target (5% of baseline weight). All participants are assessed at baseline, month 3, month 6, and every 6 months subsequently till month 36. The primary endpoint is the proportion of participants with diabetes at 3 years. Secondary endpoints include the mean change from baseline at 3 years in fasting plasma glucose, 2-hour plasma glucose, HbA1c, body weight, body mass index, physical activity, and dietary intake.

   DISCUSSION: The Pre-DICTED trial will provide evidence of the effectiveness and feasibility of a community-based stepwise diabetes prevention program with added financial incentives for individuals with pre-diabetes in Singapore. The study will provide data for a future cost-effectiveness analysis, which will be used to inform policymakers of the value of a nationwide implementation of the diabetes prevention program.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: Recent European Guidelines for Diabetes, Prediabetes and Cardiovascular Diseases introduced a shift in managing patients with type 2 diabetes at high risk for or established cardiovascular (CV) disease by recommending GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT-2 inhibitors as initial glucose-lowering therapy. This is questioned since outcome trials of these drug classes had metformin as background therapy. In this post hoc analysis, the effect of dulaglutide on CV events was investigated according to the baseline metformin therapy by means of a subgroup analysis of the Researching Cardiovascular Events with a Weekly Incretin in Diabetes (REWIND) trial.

   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients in REWIND (n = 9901; women: 46.3%; mean age: 66.2 years) had type 2 diabetes and either a previous CV event (31%) or high CV risk (69%). They were randomized (1:1) to sc. dulaglutide (1.5 mg/weekly) or placebo in addition to standard of care. The primary outcome was the first of a composite of nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and death from cardiovascular or unknown causes. Key secondary outcomes included a microvascular composite endpoint, all-cause death, and heart failure. The effect of dulaglutide in patients with and without baseline metformin was evaluated by a Cox regression hazard model with baseline metformin, dulaglutide assignment, and their interaction as independent variables. Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated by a Cox regression model with adjustments for factors differing at baseline between people with vs. without metformin, identified using the backward selection.

   RESULTS: Compared to patients with metformin at baseline (n = 8037; 81%), those without metformin (n = 1864; 19%) were older and slightly less obese and had higher proportions of women, prior CV events, heart failure, and renal disease. The primary outcome occurred in 976 (12%) participants with baseline metformin and in 281 (15%) without. There was no significant difference in the effect of dulaglutide on the primary outcome in patients with vs. without metformin at baseline [HR 0.92 (CI 0.81-1.05) vs. 0.78 (CI 0.61-0.99); interaction P = 0.18]. Findings for key secondary outcomes were similar in patients with and without baseline metformin.

   CONCLUSION: This analysis suggests that the cardioprotective effect of dulaglutide is unaffected by the baseline use of metformin therapy.

Abstract
  AIM: To test the hypothesis that the addition of periodic courses of short-term intensive insulin therapy (IIT) could enhance the effect of metformin (MET) maintenance therapy on preservation of beta-cell function following induction IIT.

   METHODS: In this multicentre, randomized controlled trial, 108 adults with type 2 diabetes (median 1.3 years' duration; HbA1c 6.6% +/- 0.6%) were randomized to 3 weeks of induction IIT (glargine, lispro) followed by MET maintenance, either with or without periodic 2-week courses of IIT every 3 months for 2 years. Beta-cell function was assessed by the Insulin Secretion Sensitivity Index-2 (ISSI-2) at an oral glucose tolerance test every 3 months.

   RESULTS: In both arms, induction IIT increased ISSI-2, improved whole-body insulin sensitivity and reduced hepatic insulin resistance (all P <= .0004). The primary outcome of baseline-adjusted ISSI-2 at 2 years was not improved by the addition of intermittent IIT (MET + IIT) and was slightly higher in the MET arm (baseline-adjusted difference -35 [95% CI: -66, -3]), with three additional beta-cell measures showing no significant differences. Baseline-adjusted HbA1c at 2 years did not differ between MET and MET + IIT (6.3% +/- 0.1% vs. 6.4% +/- 0.1%, P = .46), with 32.6% of participants in each arm maintaining HbA1c of 6.0% or less at 2 years.

   CONCLUSION: Although initial induction IIT induces metabolic improvement, subsequent repeat courses of IIT every 3 months do not further enhance the effect of MET maintenance therapy on beta-cell function. Copyright © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Abstract
  AIM: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of henagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) inadequately controlled with metformin.

   MATERIAL AND METHODS: This multicentre phase 3 trial included a 24-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled period, followed by a 28-week extension period. Patients with a glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) level of 7.0% (53 mmol/mol) to 10.5% (91 mmol/mol) were randomized and treated with once-daily placebo (n = 161), henagliflozin 5 mg (n = 162), or henagliflozin 10 mg (n = 160). After 24 weeks, patients on placebo were switched to 5 mg or 10 mg henagliflozin for the additional 28-week treatment, and patients on henagliflozin during 24-week treatment period maintained this initial therapy. The primary endpoint was change in HbA1c from baseline to Week 24.

   RESULTS: At Week 24, the least squares mean HbA1c changes versus placebo from baseline were - 0.76% (-8.3 mmol/mol) and - 0.80% (-8.7 mmol/mol) for henagliflozin 5 and 10 mg, respectively (all P < 0.0001). Compared with the placebo group, both doses of henagliflozin lowered fasting plasma glucose, 2-hour postprandial plasma glucose, body weight and blood pressure, and increased the proportions of patients achieving HbA1c <7.0% (53 mmol/mol) at Week 24. The trends in these improvements were sustained over an additional 28 weeks. Slightly higher proportions of ketosis and presence of urine ketone bodies were observed in patients treated with henagliflozin compared to placebo at Week 24. No diabetic ketoacidosis or episodes of severe hypoglycaemia were reported.

   CONCLUSIONS: Henagliflozin 5 mg or 10 mg as add-on therapy to metformin provided a new therapeutic option for the treatment of T2DM patients who have inadequate glycaemic control with metformin alone, and was generally well tolerated. Copyright © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: The Treatment Options for type 2 Diabetes in Adolescent and Youth study, a randomized clinical trial of three treatments for type 2 diabetes (T2DM) in youth, demonstrated treatment failure (defined as sustained HbA1c >=8%, or inability to wean insulin after 3 months after acute metabolic decomposition) in over half of the participants. Given that binding of mononuclear cells to vascular endothelium, initiated by cellular adhesion molecules and chemokines, is an early step in vascular injury, we sought to evaluate (a) changes in cellular adhesion molecule levels during the trial; (b) effect of diabetes treatment; and (c) association of markers with HbA1c, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, nephropathy, and retinopathy.

   METHODS: Participants (n = 515 of 699) that had baseline assessment of adhesion molecules (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 [MCP-1], vascular cell adhesion marker [VCAM], intercellular adhesion marker [ICAM], and E-Selectin) and at least one other assessment, measured at month 12, 24, or 36, were included.

   RESULTS: Over 1 to 3 years, significant increases in MCP-1 and decreases in VCAM (both P < .0001) concentrations were found; however, no significant interactions were identified with treatment group for any molecule. For every 1% increase in HbA1c, ICAM increased by 1.8%, VCAM by 1.5%, and E-selectin by 6.8% (all P < .0001). E-selectin increased by 3.7% and 4.2% for every 10 mm Hg increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively (both P < .0001). ICAM was 10.2% higher and E-selectin was 15.5% higher in participants with microalbuminuria (both P < .01). There was no significant association of adhesion molecule levels with retinopathy.

   CONCLUSION: Concentrations of cellular adhesion molecules rise with increasing HbA1c in youth with T2DM, and are associated with blood pressure and microalbuminuria, markers of vascular injury. Copyright © 2020 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Abstract
  Diabetes mellitus is a serious metabolic disorder affecting millions of people worldwide. Phenformin and metformin are biguanide antidiabetic agents that are conveniently synthesized in a single-step chemical reaction. Phenformin was once used to lower blood glucose levels, but later withdrawn from the market in several countries because it was frequently associated with lactic acidosis. Metformin is still a widely prescribed medication for the treatment of type 2 diabetes despite the introduction of several newer antidiabetic agents. Metformin is administered orally and has desirable pharmacokinetics. Incidence of metformin-induced lactic acidosis is serious but very rare. Imeglimin, a novel molecule being investigated by Poxel and Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma in Japan, is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Unlike metformin, imeglimin is a cyclic molecule containing a triazine ring. However, like metformin, imeglimin is also a basic small molecule. Imeglimin is synthesized from metformin as a precursor via a single step chemical reaction. Recent mechanism of action studies suggests that imeglimin improves mitochondria function, when given in combination with metformin it helps achieve better glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. We herein describe and compare the current status, synthesis, physicochemical properties, pharmacokinetic parameters, mechanism of action, and preclinical/clinical studies of metformin and imeglimin.

Abstract
  AIMS: To investigate the efficacy and safety of SGLT-2 inhibitors as an add-on treatment for metformin between Asian and non-Asian T2DM.

   METHODS: A systematic literature search of PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library was performed through August 2020 with the following keywords: Sodium-Glucose Transporter 2 Inhibitors, Sodium Glucose Transporter 2 Inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibitor, SGLT-2 inhibitors, type 2 diabetes, and randomized controlled trials. Double-blinded RCTs comparing SGLT-2 inhibitors as an add-on treatment for metformin and metformin monotherapy in adults with type 2 diabetes were included. A random effects model was used to calculate overall effect sizes.

   RESULTS: 5 RCTs with 1193 Asian patients and 7 RCTs with 2098 non-Asian patients were investigated. The improvement in HbA1c and fasting blood glucose in the Asian patients (WMD, -0.73%; 95% CI, -1.01% to -0.46%, p < 0.01; WMD, -1.51; 95% CI, -1.81 to -1.21, p < 0.01, respectively) were both significantly better than in the non-Asians (WMD, -0.45%; 95% CI, -0.62% to -0.29%, p < 0.01; WMD, -1.03; 95% CI, -1.27 to -0.78, p < 0.01, respectively). The effect of weight loss was similar in the non-Asian patients and Asian patients. There was little difference in the improvement of systolic blood pressure between them. The risk of serious adverse events was not significantly increased between the Asian and non-Asian patients.

   CONCLUSION: SGLT-2 inhibitors as an add-on treatment for metformin are more efficacious in East Asian T2DM patients than in non-Asian T2DM patients without an additional risk of severe adverse events.

Abstract
  Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes, and treatment strategies that impact cardiovascular (CV) outcomes in this population is an area of growing interest. Pharmacologic agents that reduce CVD risk have been developed, and data supporting their use have grown extensively. Glucagon-like peptide 1 agonists and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors when added to metformin therapy provide the most CV benefit and should be considered in most patients. Data available suggest that sulfonylureas should be avoided in patients at risk for CVD and if a thiazolidinedione is utilized, pioglitazone may be preferred. When selecting an agent, the potential benefit, risk, and cost of each agent should be considered prior to initiation. The purpose of this review is to summarize the literature surrounding the CV effects of antidiabetic agents and to provide practical guidance on their use in patients with type 2 diabetes and CVD.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a progressive disease due to multiple pathophysiological defects. Monotherapy alone cannot achieve adequate glycemic control and can lead to treatment failure. Empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter2 (SGLT2) inhibitor improves glycemic control in patients with T2DM. There were limited studies to determine efficacy and safety profile of empagliflozin with conventional oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) in Pakistan. So we investigated the efficacy and safety profile of empagliflozin as add-on therapy to metformin and sitagliptin in T2DM patients.

   METHODS: In this comparative randomized placebo-controlled trial, 240 obese type 2 diabetic patients with inadequate glycaemic control (i.e, HbA1c >=7%) with metformin and sitagliptin were allocated in to two groups. Patients in group B were given tab empagliflozin 10mg twice a day while patients in group A were given tab placebo for a period of 24 weeks. Changes in body weight, HbA1c, blood pressure were analysed pre and post treatment by using SPSS v23.

   RESULTS: Empagliflozin caused a significant reduction in body weight -6.9+/-2.4 kg as compared to placebo -3.1+/-0.8 kg with p-value <0.001. This body weight reduction was further accompanied by reduction in systolic blood pressure -10.1+/-2.6 mmHg in empagliflozin group versus -5.3+/-2.5 mmHg in placebo group with p-value <0.001, and HbA1c -1.68+/-0.45 in empagliflozin group versus -0.1+/-0.06 in placebo group with p-value <0.001. There were 28.3% patients in empagliflozin group in whom HbA1c levels reduced <7% as compared to only 13.3% patients in placebo group (p-value 0.04). However no significant adverse effects were recorded in both study groups.

   CONCLUSIONS: Empagliflozin as a combination therapy has good efficacy and safety profile in obese type 2 diabetic patients.

Abstract
  This study's primary objective was to fully characterize the pharmacokinetics of metformin in pregnant women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) versus nonpregnant controls. Steady-state oral metformin pharmacokinetics in pregnant women with GDM receiving either metformin monotherapy (n = 24) or a combination with glyburide (n = 30) as well as in nonpregnant women with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (n = 24) were determined utilizing noncompartmental techniques. Maternal and umbilical cord blood samples were collected at delivery from 38 women. With both 500- and 1000-mg doses, metformin bioavailability, volume of distribution beta (V beta ), clearance, and renal clearance were significantly increased during pregnancy. In addition, in the women receiving metformin 500 mg, significantly higher metformin apparent oral clearance (CL/F) (27%), weight-adjusted renal secretion clearance (64%), and apparent oral volume of distribution beta (V beta /F) (33%) were seen during pregnancy. Creatinine clearance was significantly higher during pregnancy. Increasing metformin dose from 500 to 1000 mg orally twice daily significantly increased V beta /F by 28%, weight-adjusted V beta /F by 32% and CL/F by 25%, and weight-adjusted CL/F by 28% during pregnancy. Mean metformin umbilical cord arterial-to-venous plasma concentration ratio was 1.0 +/- 0.1, venous umbilical cord-to-maternal concentration ratio was 1.4 +/- 0.5, and arterial umbilical cord-to-maternal concentration ratio was 1.5 +/- 0.5. Systemic exposure after a 500-mg dose of metformin was lower during pregnancy compared with the nonpregnant women with T2DM. However, in patients receiving metformin 1000 mg, changes in estimated bioavailability during pregnancy offset the changes in clearance leading to no significant change in CL/F with the higher dose. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Gestational diabetes mellitus complicates 5%-13% of pregnancies and is often treated with metformin. Pregnant women undergo physiological changes that alter drug disposition. Preliminary data suggest that pregnancy lowers metformin concentrations, potentially affecting efficacy and safety. This study definitively describes pregnancy's effects on metformin pharmacokinetics and expands the mechanistic understanding of pharmacokinetic changes across the dosage range. Here we report the nonlinearity of metformin pharmacokinetics and the increase in bioavailability, clearance, renal clearance, and volume of distribution during pregnancy.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: Clinical studies have produced conflicting results on the effects of metformin on gastrointestinal cancer development. We aimed to investigate the association between metformin use and stomach, colon, liver, and pancreatic cancer development among patients with newly diagnosed, drug-naive type 2 diabetes.

   METHODS: This retrospective study evaluated propensity score-matched patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes from the Korean National Health Insurance Service database. Metformin users were categorized into tertiles according to the cumulative dose or duration of metformin treatment, and the risks of gastrointestinal cancers were compared.

   RESULTS: Metformin users had reduced risks of developing stomach cancer (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.841, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.797-0.887), colon cancer (HR: 0.865, 95% CI: 0.822-0.91), and liver cancer (HR: 0.709, 95% CI: 0.675-0.746; P < 0.001). However, metformin users did not have a reduced overall risk of pancreatic cancer (HR: 1.335, 95% CI: 1.209-1.475; P < 0.001). The risks tended to decrease at higher cumulative doses and durations of metformin use, with significantly reduced risks of all 4 cancers at the highest cumulative dose (>=1,200,000 mg) and the longest duration (>=2,000 days) of metformin use.

   DISCUSSION: This population-based data suggest that metformin could be associated with reductions in the risks of stomach, colon, and liver cancers, as well a reduced risk of pancreatic cancer in some subgroups. Metformin has benefit as a first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus. A further role in cancer risk reduction could be studied in controlled trials.

Abstract
  Preclinical studies have shown a potential osteoanabolic effect of metformin but human studies of how metformin affects bone turnover are few. A post hoc sub-study analysis of an 18-month multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), randomizing participants to metformin versus placebo both in combination with different insulin analogue regimens (Metformin + Insulin vs. Placebo + Insulin). Patients were not treatment naive at baseline, 83% had received metformin, 69% had received insulin, 57.5% had received the combination of metformin and insulin before entering the study. Bone formation and resorption were assessed by measuring, N-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen (P1NP) and C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX) at baseline and end of study. The influence of gender, age, smoking, body mass index (BMI), T2DM duration, glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), c-reactive protein (CRP) and insulin dosage was also included in the analyses. The levels of bone formation marker P1NP and bone resorption marker CTX increased significantly in both groups during the trial. P1NP increased less in the Metformin + Insulin compared to the placebo + insulin group (p = 0.001) (between group difference change), while the increases in CTX levels (p = 0.11) were not different. CRP was inversely associated (p = 0.012) and insulin dosage (p = 0.011) was positively related with change in P1NP levels. BMI (p = 0.002) and HbA1C (p = 0.037) were inversely associated with change in CTX levels. During 18 months of treatment with metformin or placebo, both in combination with insulin, bone turnover increased in both groups. But the pattern was different as the bone formation marker (P1NP) increased less during Metformin + Insulin treatment, while change in bone resorption (CTX) was not significantly different between the two groups.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: Practice guidelines advise caution on the use of metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with chronic kidney disease (CKD). This review aims to examine the evidence for the benefits and risks of metformin use in patients with T2DM and CKD.

   METHODS: The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and PubMed were searched; the references of selected papers were hand searched. Systematic reviews, randomised controlled trials, cohort studies, case series and case-control studies were included. The full text of selected articles was reviewed. The outcomes studied were all-cause mortality, cardiovascular complications, lactic acidosis and worsening of renal function. Recommendations were graded according to the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network system.

   RESULTS: A total of 139 unique articles were identified, 14 of which met the inclusion criteria and were selected for full-text review. Four cohort studies reported an association between metformin use and improved all-cause mortality in CKD stage 4 and better. Two cohort studies reported improved cardiovascular outcomes with metformin use. Four cohort studies, 1 case series and 1 case-control study reported no significant association between metformin use and an increased risk of lactic acidosis in CKD. There is a moderate level of evidence to support reduced mortality, improved cardiovascular outcomes and a low risk of lactic acidosis with metformin use in patients with T2DM and with CKD stage 4 and above.

   CONCLUSION: Existing recommendations to restrict metformin use in diabetes patients with CKD need to be reviewed in light of emerging evidence supporting its overall benefits in these patients.

Abstract
  AIMS: To investigate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of sitagliptin 50 mg once daily added to ipragliflozin 50 mg once daily monotherapy in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D).

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Japanese patients with T2D and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) 7.0% to 10.0% while treated with ipragliflozin 50 mg once daily were randomized 1:1 to additional treatment with sitagliptin 50 mg once daily (N = 70) or matching placebo (N = 71) for 24 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was change in HbA1c at Week 24. Secondary efficacy endpoints were changes in 2-hour post-meal glucose (PMG), total PMG 0- to 2-hour area under the curve (AUC0-2h ), and fasting plasma glucose (FPG).

   RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were similar in the two groups (mean age 55.5 years, mean baseline HbA1c 8.0%). After 24 weeks, the addition of sitagliptin provided significantly greater reduction in HbA1c compared to placebo (least squares [LS] mean difference -0.83% [95% confidence interval -1.05, -0.62]; P <0.001). Significant reductions were also observed in all secondary endpoints: LS mean differences from placebo in changes in 2-hour PMG, total PMG AUC0-2h , and FPG were -42.5 mg/dL, -67.0 mg.h/dL and -11.2 mg/dL, respectively (all P <0.001). The incidence of adverse events (AEs) overall and incidence of predefined AEs of clinical interest (symptomatic hypoglycaemia, urinary tract infection, genital infection, hypovolaemia and polyuria/pollakiuria) were similar in the two groups.

   CONCLUSIONS: In Japanese patients with T2D, sitagliptin 50 mg once daily added to ipragliflozin 50 mg once daily monotherapy provided significant improvement in glycaemic control and was generally well tolerated.

Abstract
  AIMS: To investigate the potential synergistic effects of combined exenatide (EXE) and dapagliflozin (DAPA) versus (PLAC) placebo and DAPA on hepatocellular lipid (HCL) reduction after 24 weeks of treatment.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty patients with type 2 diabetes were randomized to weekly EXE and daily DAPA (n = 16) or weekly PLAC and daily DAPA (n = 14). Inclusion criteria were glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) 48 to 97 mmol/mol (6.5-11%), age 18 to 75 years, body mass index (BMI) >=25 kg/m2 and metformin >=1000 mg. The primary endpoint, HCL levels, were measured at baseline and after 24 weeks of treatment using magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Between-group effects were analysed using general linear models, adjusted for baseline outcome variables, age, sex and BMI. Within-group differences were assessed using a paired t-test.

   RESULTS: After 24 weeks, HCLs were reduced in both treatment groups (absolute change from baseline: EXE + DAPA -4.4%, 95% confidence interval [CI] -8.2, -0.7, P < 0.05; PLAC + DAPA -3.9%, 95% CI -6.0, -1.7, P < 0.01; relative change: EXE + DAPA -35.6%, PLAC + DAPA -32.3%) with no difference between groups. Similar findings were observed for subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT). HbA1c (EXE + DAPA -17.8 mmol/mol, [95% CI -24.8, -10.8], P <0.001; PLAC + DAPA -6.9 mmol/mol, [95% CI -10.5, -3.3], P = 0.001) and fasting glucose significantly decreased in both groups, although EXE + DAPA achieved better glycaemic control than PLAC + DAPA (adjusted difference: HbA1c -6.0 mmol/mol [95% CI -9.7, -2.2], P < 0.01). Body weight was reduced in both treatment groups (EXE + DAPA -7.3 kg, 95% CI -9.9, -4.8, P <0.001; PLAC + DAPA -4.6 kg, 95% CI -7.4, -1.8, P <0.01) with comparable results between groups. Changes in HCLs and weight, hip and waist circumference, VAT and SAT were positively associated.

   CONCLUSION: After 24 weeks, HCLs were significantly but comparably reduced in the EXE + DAPA and PLAC + DAPA groups, despite significantly better glycaemic control in the combined group EXE + DAPA. Changes in HCLs were associated with weight loss and reduction of visceral adiposity, but not with glucose control. Further studies are necessary to evaluate possible additional long-term effects of a combined treatment. Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Persistence hyperglycemia results in the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) by non-enzymatic glycation. AGEs and their receptor RAGE play an important role in generation of inflammatory molecules and oxidative stress. Metformin regulates insulin responsive gene and helps to achieve glycemic control however, no extensive study reported about its role against glycation induced oxidative stress and vascular inflammation. Therefore, present work focused on clinical relevance of three months metformin therapy in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients against glycation induced oxidative stress and vascular inflammation.

   METHODS: Among recruited 40 medicated-naive type 2 diabetes mellitus patients, 31 patients were continued with metformin therapy. Biomarkers of plasma protein glycation (fructosamine, protein carbonyls, beta-amyloid) antioxidants and oxidative stress markers (GSH, catalase, NO, PON-1, AOPP, LPO; RAGE isoforms (sRAGE, esRAGE); inflammatory markers (IL-6, TNF-alpha) were determined at baseline and after 3-months of treatment. The expression profile of membrane RAGE, NF-kappaB, CML was studied in PBMNCs and GLUT-1 in erythrocyte ghost by western blotting.

   RESULTS: Metformin showed maximum percent declined from baseline to three months therapy in levels of fructosamine, beta-amyloid, sRAGE, inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-alpha) and percent increment in esRAGE and antioxidants levels. It showed reduced levels of IL-6 and TNF-alpha by declining expression of CML, membrane RAGE and NF-kappaB in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients after three months therapy.

   CONCLUSIONS: First report in Indian diabetes mellitus patients, where metformin showed effective inhibition against glycation and receptor mediated cellular inflammation. However, these findings need to be tested in a randomized trial. Copyright © 2020 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  AIM: To compare the long-term efficacy of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors as second-line drugs after metformin for patients not at high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a 52-week randomized open-label trial, we compared ipragliflozin and sitagliptin in Japanese patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, without prior ASCVD and treated with metformin. The primary endpoint was a glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) reduction of >=0.5% (5.5 mmol/mol) without weight gain at 52 weeks.

   RESULTS: Of a total of 111 patients (mean age 59.2 years, mean body mass index [BMI] 26.6 kg/m2 , 61.3% men), 54 patients received ipragliflozin and 57 received sitagliptin. After 52 weeks, achievement of the primary endpoint was not significantly different (37.0% and 40.3%; P = 0.72). HbA1c reduction rate at 24 weeks was greater for sitagliptin (56.1%) than for ipragliflozin (31.5%; P = 0.01). From 24 to 52 weeks, the HbA1c reduction with sitagliptin was attenuated, with no significant difference in HbA1c reduction after 52 weeks between sitagliptin (54.4%) and ipragliflozin (38.9%; P = 0.10). Improvements in BMI, C-peptide and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were greater with ipragliflozin than with sitagliptin. Adverse events occurred in 17 patients with ipragliflozin and in 10 patients with sitagliptin (P = 0.11).

   CONCLUSION: The HbA1c-lowering effect at 24 weeks was greater with sitagliptin than with ipragliflozin, but with no difference in efficacy related to HbA1c and body weight at 52 weeks. However, some ASCVD risk factors improved with ipragliflozin. Copyright © 2020 The Authors. Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Abstract
  We validated the effect of linagliptin, an oral dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). A total of 50 patients with NAFLD and T2DM treated with metformin were randomized (1:1) to metformin plus add-on linagliptin (linagliptin group) or to an increased dose of metformin (metformin group) for 52 weeks. The primary endpoint was change in hepatic steatosis from baseline to week 52 as quantified by unenhanced computed tomography imaging. Secondary endpoints included changes in the levels of anthropometric, biochemical and adipokinetic markers. The linagliptin group showed no statistically significant reduction in hepatic steatosis as compared to the metformin group (P = 0.97), although changes in hepatic steatosis were significantly correlated with decreased liver enzymes in both groups. Body weight was significantly reduced in the metformin group but not in the linagliptin group (P = 0.002). Serum leptin levels were significantly increased in the linagliptin group compared to the metformin group (P = 0.003), and were correlated with the changes body weight in whole samples. Adverse events were not different between the two groups (P = 0.78). Add-on linagliptin demonstrated a safe profile but was not superior to increased metformin in reducing hepatic steatosis.

Abstract
  This study investigates the protective effect of formulated marble vine/plantain dough meals on cognitive impairment in diabetic rats. Wistar rats were divided into eight groups (n = 6) and fed with HFD for 14 days and a single dose of streptozotocin intraperitoneally on the 14th day (except control rats). Diabetic rats were treated with formulated diets and metformin. The ameliorative effect of the formulated doughs on cerebral damage in diabetic rats with respect to weight gain/loss, glucose and insulin levels, oxidative damage, neurological dysfunction, and histological alterations were assessed. The formulated diet had high protein and fiber content values ranged from 13.00 to 25.04 g/100 g and from 5.23 to 6.20 g/100 g, respectively compared to the control. Blood glucose level was observed, thereby mitigating the cerebral oxidative damage. The diet significantly ameliorated the neurological dysfunction as adjudged by increased dopamine concentration and lowered acetylcholinesterase activity; results were also supported by the outcomes from brain histopathological study. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Underutilized leguminous seeds such as marble vine seeds are known for their nutraceutical potentials due to their numerous biochemical components. The study provides preliminary information on the potential of marble vine/plantain functional dough meals in the management of neurological complications resulting from type 2 diabetes mellitus in albino rats. Generally, the formulated doughs possess neuroprotective potentials in preventing neurological complications arising from diabetes. However, the effect of marble vine-plantain dough meal in managing the brain damage should be further investigated through the clinical trials before development for pharmaceutical applications.

Abstract
  AIMS: This study compared the reduction of glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) with sodium-glucose cotransporter type-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) vs. dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4is) as add-ons to metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), with a specific focus on HbA1c changes according to baseline HbA1c.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Electronic databases were scrutinized for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the reduction of HbA1c from baseline (DELTA HbA1c) with an SGLT2i or DPP-4i in patients with T2DM not well controlled by metformin monotherapy. The endpoint was DELTA HbA1c using both indirect and direct comparisons.

   RESULTS: Overall, DELTA HbA1c was slightly greater with SGLT2is (-0.80+/-0.20% from 8.03+/-0.35%; 44 analyses, 29 RCTs, 15 with two doses, n=9321) than with DPP-4is (-0.71+/-0.23% from 8.05+/-0.43%; 61 analyses, 59 RCTs, n=17,914; P=0.0354). When the mean baseline HbA1c was<8% ([64mmol/mol] 7.79+/-0.15% vs. 7.71+/-0.23%), DELTA HbA1c averaged -0.735+/-0.17% vs. -0.62+/-0.16% (P=0.0117) with SGLT2is vs. DPP-4is, respectively. However, this difference vanished when the mean baseline HbA1c was>=8% (-0.87+/-0.22% from 8.27+/-0.32% with SGLT2is vs. -0.80+/-0.24% from 8.35+/-0.33% with DPP-4is; P=0.2756). The relationship between DELTA HbA1c and baseline HbA1c was only slightly stronger with SGLT2is (slope: -0.39, r2=-0.43; P<0.0001) than with DPP-4is (slope: -0.26, r2=-0.25; P<0.0001).

   CONCLUSION: Because of the small difference in DELTA HbA1c whatever the baseline HbA1c level with SGLT2is vs. DPP-4is as add-ons to metformin, choosing between these glucose-lowering agents in clinical practice should be based on other efficacy criteria (such as weight and blood pressure changes, cardiovascular and renal protection) or on safety profiles rather than on HbA1c levels.

Abstract
  AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) are usually treated with (combinations of) glucose-lowering medication. The effects of these drugs can be influenced by intestinal microbiota and vice versa, as these drugs can also influence microbiome composition. However, as there is currently little clinical insight into this bug-drug interaction, our study aimed to evaluate the effects of 12-week treatment with the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin and sulphonylurea gliclazide on gut microbiome composition in T2D patients treated with metformin.

   METHODS: A total of 44 patients were randomized to either dapagliflozin or gliclazide treatment for 12 weeks. At baseline and after 12 weeks, faecal samples and 24-h urine were collected. During study visits, anthropometric data were measured and blood samples drawn after an overnight fast. Microbiome composition was determined by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Plasma glucose, insulin, HbA1c and urinary glucose excretion were measured using conventional methods.

   RESULTS: While dapagliflozin and gliclazide similarly improved glycaemic control, dapagliflozin reduced and gliclazide increased fasting insulin. Dapagliflozin also greatly increased urinary glucose excretion whereas gliclazide did not, while body mass index, fat mass percentage and waist circumference were reduced by dapagliflozin, but increased by gliclazide. However, neither treatment significantly affected either gut microbiome alpha diversity or composition and, after treatment, no associations were found between microbiome composition and other clinical parameters.

   CONCLUSION: Even though gliclazide and dapagliflozin have different metabolic actions in patients with T2D, neither treatment altered the faecal microbiome, thereby suggesting that the observed metabolic changes are not mediated by their effects on the microbiota.

Abstract
  AIMS: SUSTAIN 10 compared the efficacy and safety of the anticipated most frequent semaglutide dose (1.0mg) with the current most frequently prescribed liraglutide dose in Europe (1.2mg), reflecting clinical practice.

   METHODS: In this phase 3b, open-label trial, 577 adults with type 2 diabetes (HbA1c 7.0-11.0%) on 1-3 oral antidiabetic drugs were randomized 1:1 to subcutaneous once-weekly semaglutide 1.0mg or subcutaneous once-daily liraglutide 1.2mg. Primary and confirmatory secondary endpoints were changes in HbA1c and body weight from baseline to week 30, respectively.

   RESULTS: Mean HbA1c (baseline 8.2%) decreased by 1.7% with semaglutide and 1.0% with liraglutide (estimated treatment difference [ETD] -0.69%; 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.82 to -0.56, P<0.0001). Mean body weight (baseline 96.9kg) decreased by 5.8kg with semaglutide and 1.9kg with liraglutide (ETD -3.83kg; 95% CI -4.57 to -3.09, P<0.0001). The proportions of subjects achieving glycaemic targets of<7.0% and=6.5%, weight loss of=5% and=10%, and a composite endpoint of HbA1c<7.0% without severe or blood glucose-confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemia and no weight gain were greater with semaglutide vs liraglutide (all P<0.0001). Both treatments had similar safety profiles, except for more frequent gastrointestinal disorders (the most common adverse events [AEs]) and AEs leading to premature treatment discontinuation with semaglutide vs liraglutide (43.9% vs 38.3% and 11.4% vs 6.6%, respectively).

   CONCLUSION: Semaglutide was superior to liraglutide in reducing HbA1c and body weight. Safety profiles were generally similar, except for higher rates of gastrointestinal AEs with semaglutide vs liraglutide. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  AIMS/INTRODUCTION: This secondary analysis of the 24-week SMART study examined the efficacy of add-on saxagliptin or acarbose to metformin across different patient subgroups with type 2 diabetes mellitus, based on baseline characteristics.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Randomized patients (n = 481) were classified into subgroups based on their baseline age (<65, >=65 years), body mass index (BMI; <24, 24-<28, >=28 kg/m2 ), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c; <8%, 8-<9%, 9-<10%, >=10%) and renal function (creatinine clearance 50-<80, >=80 mL/min). Treatment effects on primary outcome (HbA1c) and key secondary outcomes of fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2-h postprandial glucose and homeostatic model assessment of beta-cell function were assessed across patient subgroups.

   RESULTS: For saxagliptin, reductions in HbA1c from baseline to week 24 were consistent across different subgroups regardless of baseline age, body mass index, HbA1c and renal function (range -0.66 to -1.16%). Saxagliptin was associated with consistent reductions in FPG (-0.60 to -1.33 mmol/L) and 2-h postprandial glucose (-0.48 to -1.95 mmol/L) across the majority of subgroups studied. The efficacy of acarbose on FPG attenuated progressively with increasing baseline HbA1c (+0.86 to -1.43 mmol/L); an increase from baseline FPG was observed in patients with HbA1c >9%. The effect of acarbose on postprandial glucose was also variable (+0.23 to -3.38 mmol/L).

   CONCLUSIONS: As add-on to metformin, both saxagliptin and acarbose reduced HbA1c regardless of baseline HbA1c, age, body mass index and renal function; however, only saxagliptin was effective at a stable glycemic control (FPG and PPG). The efficacy of acarbose on FPG and PPG was significantly attenuated in patients with higher baseline HbA1c (>=8%). Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

Abstract
  AIM: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of adding either a sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) or thiazolidinedione (TZD) in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) inadequately controlled with triple therapy.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective, open-label, multicentre, 24-week clinical trial, we randomly assigned 119 patients with T2D who failed to achieve glycaemic control (7% < HbA1c <= 10%) with conventional triple oral antidiabetic agents (OADs; metformin, sulphonylurea and dipeptidyl peptide-4 [DPP-4] inhibitor) into two groups who received either an SGLT2i or TZD. The primary endpoint was mean change in HbA1c level between the two groups at 24 weeks.

   RESULTS: In total, 119 patients were enrolled in the SGLT2i (n = 60) and TZD (n = 59) groups. Mean age of the study subjects was 61.86 years, and the mean duration of T2D was 13.89 years. After 24 weeks, both groups showed significant reductions in HbA1c (from 7.94% +/- 0.74% to 6.97% +/- 0.84% in the SGLT2i group and from 8.00% +/- 0.78% to 7.18% +/- 0.98% in the TZD group), without a significant between-group difference (P = .235). A significant body mass index (BMI) reduction was noted in the SGLT2i group, whereas an increase in BMI was noted in the TZD group (-0.79 +/- 1.37 vs. 0.92 +/- 0.86 kg/m2 , P < .001). Other safety profiles were favourable in both groups.

   CONCLUSIONS: The current study shows that an SGLT2i or TZD could be a valid option as a fourth OAD for treatment of patients with T2D inadequately controlled with a triple combination of OADs. Copyright © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Abstract
  AIM: To assess the effects of dapagliflozin, metformin and exercise treatment on changes in plasma glucagon concentrations in individuals with overweight and HbA1c-defined prediabetes.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: One-hundred and twenty individuals with overweight (body mass index >= 25 kg/m2 ) and prediabetes (HbA1c of 39-47 mmol/mol) were randomized to a 13-week intervention with dapagliflozin (10 mg once daily), metformin (850 mg twice daily), exercise (30 minutes of interval training 5 days per week) or control (habitual living). A 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) (0, 30, 60 and 120 minutes) was administered at baseline, at 13 weeks (end of intervention) and at 26 weeks (end of follow-up). Linear mixed effects models with participant-specific random intercepts were used to investigate associations of the interventions with fasting plasma glucagon concentration, insulin/glucagon ratio and glucagon suppression during the OGTT.

   RESULTS: At baseline, the median (Q1; Q3) age was 62 (54; 68) years, median fasting plasma glucagon concentration was 11 (7; 15) pmol/L, mean (SD) HbA1c was 40.9 (2.3) mmol/mol and 56% were women. Compared with the control group, fasting glucagon did not change in any of the groups from baseline to the end of the intervention (dapagliflozin group: -5% [95% CI: -29; 26]; exercise group: -8% [95% CI: -31; 24]; metformin group: -2% [95% CI: -27; 30]). Likewise, there were no differences in insulin/glucagon ratio and glucagon suppression during the OGTT between the groups.

   CONCLUSIONS: In individuals with prediabetes, 13 weeks of treatment with dapagliflozin, metformin or exercise was not associated with changes in fasting or post-OGTT glucagon concentrations. Copyright © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Abstract
  AIM: To investigate the association of different categories of baseline cardio-metabolic risk factors on the treatment effects of empagliflozin 10 and 25 mg when added as second-line therapy to metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D).

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients aged 18 years or older with HbA1c 7.0%-10.0% were included. Analysis of covariance compared change from baseline to weeks 24 and 76 in HbA1c, body weight (BW) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) by respective baseline categories (HbA1c <8.5/>=8.5%; BW <80/80-90/>90 kg, SBP <130/130-140/>140 mmHg). Analyses were also conducted with a model using continuous covariates of cardio-metabolic factors.

   RESULTS: In total, 637 patients (56.7% males; mean [SD] age 55.7 [9.9] years, HbA1c 7.9% [0.9%], BW 81.2 [18.8] kg, SBP 129.4 [14.6] mmHg) received one or more dose of either empagliflozin 10 mg (n = 217) or 25 mg (n = 213), or placebo (n = 207). At both time points, empagliflozin 10/25 mg versus placebo significantly (P < .0001) reduced HbA1c and BW, with greater reductions in HbA1c at higher baseline HbA1c (P interaction week 24/76 categorical and continuous models: .0290/.1431 and .0004/.0042, respectively) and in BW (P interaction .1340/.0012 and .0202/<.0001, respectively). Both empagliflozin doses also significantly lowered SBP versus placebo at both time points, with similar efficacy by subgroups of baseline SBP. Adverse events were consistent with the established empagliflozin safety profile across treatment groups.

   CONCLUSIONS: Empagliflozin, as add-on to metformin, decreases HbA1c and BW, particularly in patients with higher HbA1c and BW baseline values, and effectively lowers SBP. Copyright © 2020 The Authors. Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Abstract
  This 24-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of linagliptin in 206 Chinese patients with inadequately controlled (glycated haemoglobin [HbA1c] 7.5%-10.0%) type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) receiving insulin (basal or premixed) +/- metformin. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive linagliptin 5 mg/d or placebo. The decrease from baseline in HbA1c (primary endpoint) was greater with linagliptin than with placebo (-0.61% vs. -0.20%, adjusted mean difference -0.40%; P = 0.0016). Linagliptin demonstrated significantly greater improvement in 2-hour postprandial glucose (-1.77 mmol/L [-31.95 mg/dL]; P < 0.001), and a numerical reduction in fasting plasma glucose (-0.34 mmol/L [-6.2 mg/dL]; P = 0.2241) versus placebo. Proportionally more patients on linagliptin achieved a HbA1c reduction of >=0.5% versus those on placebo (odds ratio 2.293, P < 0.01). Adverse events in both groups were similar, with no new safety findings or clinically relevant changes in body weight. Among investigator-defined hypoglycaemic events (linagliptin: 17.3%; placebo: 12.7%; odds ratio 1.48, P = 0.337), none were severe. In Chinese patients with T2DM, linagliptin add-on to insulin improved glycaemic control and was well tolerated, without increased risk of hypoglycaemia or weight gain.

Abstract
  AIM: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue, versus once-daily sitagliptin as add-on to metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) in a multiregional clinical trial.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the 30-week, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active comparator SUSTAIN China trial, 868 adults with T2D inadequately controlled on metformin (HbA1c 7.0%-10.5%) were randomized to receive once-weekly semaglutide 0.5 mg (n = 288), semaglutide 1.0 mg (n = 290) or once-daily sitagliptin 100 mg (n = 290). The primary and confirmatory secondary endpoints were change from baseline to week 30 in HbA1c and body weight, respectively.

   RESULTS: The trial enrolled ~70% (605/868) of the patients in China, and the remaining patients from four other countries, including the Republic of Korea. Both doses of semaglutide were superior to sitagliptin in reducing HbA1c and body weight after 30 weeks of treatment. The odds of achieving target HbA1c of less than 7.0% (53 mmol/mol), weight loss of 5% or higher, or 10% or higher, and the composite endpoint of HbA1c less than 7.0% (53 mmol/mol) without severe or blood glucose-confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemia no weight gain, were all significantly higher with both semaglutide doses compared with sitagliptin. The safety profile for semaglutide was consistent with the known class effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists (RAs). Consistent efficacy and safety findings were seen in the Chinese subpopulation.

   CONCLUSIONS: Once-weekly semaglutide was superior to sitagliptin in improving glycaemic control and reducing body weight in patients with T2D inadequately controlled on metformin. The safety and tolerability profiles were consistent with those of semaglutide and other GLP-1 RAs. Semaglutide is an effective once-weekly treatment option for the Chinese population.

Abstract
  We analysed glycaemic durability (sustained glycaemic control) with early combination therapy (metformin plus vildagliptin) versus metformin monotherapy, among patients with type 2 diabetes diagnosed before (young-onset [YOD]) and after (late-onset [LOD]) the age of 40 years, enrolled in the VERIFY trial. The primary endpoint was time to initial treatment failure (TF), defined as HbA1c of 7.0% or higher at two consecutive scheduled visits after randomization. The time to secondary TF was assessed when both groups were receiving and failing on the combination. A total of 186 (9.3%) patients had YOD and 1815 (90.7%) had LOD with a mean age difference of 20.4 years. Compared with metformin monotherapy, early combination reduced the risk of time to initial TF for both YOD (48%, P < .0006) and LOD (46%, P < .0001). With early combination, risk for time to secondary TF was reduced by 48% (P < .0035) in YOD and 24% (P < .0009) in LOD. Both treatment approaches were well tolerated with no unexpected safety concerns. In treatment-naive patients with YOD (HbA1c 6.5%-7.5%), an early combination strategy improved attainment of the glycaemic target with durability and delayed treatment escalation compared with initial metformin monotherapy.

Abstract
  AIM: To assess the associations between baseline glucose-lowering agents (GLAs) and cardiorenal outcomes with dapagliflozin versus placebo in the DECLARE-TIMI 58 study.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: DECLARE-TIMI 58 assessed the cardiorenal outcomes of dapagliflozin versus placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes. This post hoc analysis elaborates the efficacy and safety outcomes by baseline GLA for treatment effect and GLA-based treatment interaction.

   RESULTS: At baseline, 14 068 patients (82.0%) used metformin, 7322 (42.7%) sulphonylureas, 2888 (16.8%) dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, 750 (4.4%) glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) and 7013 (40.9%) insulin. Dapagliflozin reduced the composite of cardiovascular death (CVD) and hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) versus placebo regardless of baseline GLA, with greater benefit in the small group of patients with baseline use of GLP-1 RAs (HR [95% CI] 0.37 [0.18, 0.78] vs. 0.86 [0.75, 0.98] in GLP-1 RA users vs. non-users, Pinteraction = .03). The overall HR for major adverse cardiovascular events (CVD, myocardial infarction or ischaemic stroke) was 0.93 (95% CI 0.84, 1.03) with dapagliflozin versus placebo, with no interaction by baseline GLA (Pinteraction > .05). The renal-specific outcome was reduced with dapagliflozin versus placebo in the overall cohort (HR [95%CI] 0.53[0.43-0.66]), with no interaction by baseline GLA (Pinteraction > .05). All of these outcomes were similar in those with versus those without baseline metformin use.

   CONCLUSIONS: The effects of dapagliflozin on cardiorenal outcomes were generally consistent regardless of baseline GLA, with consistent benefits regardless of baseline metformin use. The potential clinical benefit of combining sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors with GLP-1 RAs, given some evidence of cardiovascular risk reduction with both classes, should be explored further.

Abstract
  AIM: To assess whether the effects of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors on cardiovascular, kidney and mortality outcomes are consistent with and without concomitant metformin use.

   MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a meta-analysis of event-driven, randomized, placebo-controlled SGLT2 inhibitor trials that reported cardiovascular, kidney or mortality outcomes by baseline metformin use. Treatment effects, reported as hazards ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. The main outcomes in this analysis were (i) major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and (ii) hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) or cardiovascular death.

   RESULTS: We included six trials of four SGLT2 inhibitors that enrolled a total of 51 743 participants. Baseline metformin use varied from 21% in DAPA-HF to 82% in DECLARE-TIMI 58. SGLT2 inhibitors reduced the risk of MACE, with and without concomitant metformin use (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.87-1.00 and HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.71-0.86, respectively; P-heterogeneity = 0.14). There were also clear and separate reductions in HHF or cardiovascular death with SGLT2 inhibitors, irrespective of metformin use (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.73-0.86 and HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.63-0.87, respectively; P-heterogeneity = 0.48), as well as for major kidney outcomes and all-cause mortality (all P-heterogeneity > 0.40).

   CONCLUSION: Treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors results in clear and consistent reductions in cardiovascular, kidney and mortality outcomes regardless of whether patients are receiving or not receiving metformin.

Abstract
  AIM: To systematically review the effects of pharmacological and lifestyle interventions on body weight as a secondary outcome in people with type 1 diabetes.

   METHODS: The Ovid Medline, Embase and Cochrane Library databases were searched for relevant pharmacological (glucagon-like peptide-1 [GLP-1] receptor agonist, sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 [SGLT-2] inhibitor, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 [DPP-4] inhibitor and metformin) and lifestyle intervention studies (diet and exercise) for adults with type 1 diabetes reporting body weight change and HbA1c published from January 2000 to May 2020. Meta-analyses were performed for 16 randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

   RESULTS: Thirty-three RCTs (n = 9344 participants), 26 pharmacological (on average 43.9 years, 83.1 kg, HbA1c 8.1%; 55.8% male) and seven lifestyle-based interventions (on average 37.0 years, 85.0 kg, HbA1c 8.1%; 84.6% male), were analysed. The GLP-1 receptor agonist liraglutide 0.6 mg (mean difference [MD]: -2.22 kg [95% CI: -2.55 to -1.90]), 1.2 mg (MD: -3.74 kg [95% CI: -4.16 to -3.33]) and 1.8 mg (MD: -4.85 kg [95% CI: -5.29 to -4.41]), and the SGLT-2 inhibitors empagliflozin 2.5 mg (MD: -1.47 kg [95% CI: -2.23 to -0.71]), 10 mg (MD: -2.77 kg [95% CI: -3.24 to -2.31]) and 25 mg (MD: -3.06 kg [95% CI: -3.57 to -2.55]) and sotagliflozin 200 mg (MD: -2.40 kg [95% CI: -2.87 to -1.94]) and 400 mg (MD: -3.23 [95% CI: -3.73 to -2.72]) were associated with significant reductions in body weight. No significant effect on body weight was found for DPP-4 inhibitors, other GLP-1-receptor agonists, metformin, or for lifestyle interventions (i.e. exercise and diet).

   CONCLUSIONS: In people with type 1 diabetes, several adjuvant pharmacological interventions showed weight reduction as a secondary outcome. Future studies in overweight people with type 1 diabetes are needed to establish whether the lifestyle and pharmacological interventions reviewed here have potential as components of complex interventions aimed at body weight reduction as a primary outcome.

Abstract
  AIM: To identify predictors of response to glucose-lowering therapy in patients with new-onset diabetes and very high HbA1c (>10%).

   METHODS: The study included EDICT participants with an initial HbA1c of more than 10% (N = 104). All subjects received a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) before initiation of therapy, and then were randomized to receive: (a) initial triple therapy with metformin, pioglitazone and exenatide versus (b) stepwise conventional therapy with metformin followed by glipizide and then glargine insulin to reduce HbA1c to less than 6.5%. Insulin secretion and insulin resistance were calculated with OGTT-derived indices.

   RESULTS: Sixty-one per cent of participants in the conventional therapy group achieved HbA1c of less than 6.5% at 6 months without need of insulin therapy compared with 78% in the triple therapy group (P = NS). Insulin secretion at baseline was the strongest predictor of subjects who did not require insulin therapy; a cut point of CPEP120 /CPEP0 -the ratio between plasma C-peptide concentration at 120 minutes during the OGTT and fasting plasma C-peptide concentration-of more than 1.7 predicted subjects who achieved the treatment target without insulin, irrespective of the fasting plasma glucose (FPG) concentration and whether or not they were started on conventional or triple therapy. Subjects with a CPEP120 /CPEP0 of less than 1.7 plus FPG of 269 mg/dL or less (<=14.9 mmoL/L) also achieved the treatment goal with triple therapy.

   CONCLUSION: Insulin secretion in response to a 75-g OGTT predicts the need for insulin therapy at the time of type 2 diabetes (T2D) diagnosis. A cut point of 1.7 of CPEP120 /CPEP0 provides a useful clinical tool to individualize glucose-lowering therapy in patients with new-onset T2D and HbA1c of more than 10%.

Abstract
  AIM: To assess the efficacy and safety of ertugliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) inadequately controlled by insulin.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: VERTIS CV was the cardiovascular outcome study for ertugliflozin. Patients were randomly assigned to placebo, or ertugliflozin 5 mg or 15 mg once daily. We report the results of a substudy in patients on a stable dose of insulin >=20 units/d. The primary endpoint was glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) change from baseline to 18 weeks. Secondary endpoints were changes in fasting plasma glucose (FPG), body weight (BW), the proportion of patients with HbA1c <53 mmol/mol (<7%), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure and insulin dose.

   RESULTS: Of 8246 patients randomized in VERTIS CV, 1065 were included in the substudy (68.2% men, mean [SD] age 64.8 [7.8] years, T2DM duration 16.7 [9.0] years, HbA1c 8.4 [1.0]%). At week 18, the least squares (LS) mean change from baseline in HbA1c was significantly greater with ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg versus placebo (placebo-adjusted LS mean change -0.58%, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.71, -0.44 and -0.65%, 95% CI -0.78, -0.51, respectively; P < 0.001 for both). Ertugliflozin significantly reduced FPG, BW and SBP. In women, the incidence of genital mycotic infections was higher with ertugliflozin (3.5%) versus placebo (0.0%). The incidence of symptomatic hypoglycaemia was similar across treatment groups.

   CONCLUSIONS: Ertugliflozin added to insulin improved glycaemic control, BW and SBP versus placebo at 18 weeks in patients with T2DM and ASCVD. Copyright © 2021 The Authors. Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Abstract
  AIM: To explore the early effects of dapagliflozin on myocardial function and metabolism in patients with type 2 diabetes without heart failure.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with type 2 diabetes on metformin treatment were randomized to double-blind, 6-week placebo or dapagliflozin 10 mg daily treatment. Investigations included cardiac function and structure with myocardial resonance imaging; cardiac oxygen consumption, perfusion and efficiency with [11 C]-acetate positron emission tomography (PET); and cardiac and hepatic fatty acid uptake with [18 F]-6-thia-heptadecanoic acid PET, analysed by ANCOVA as least square means with 95% confidence intervals.

   RESULTS: Evaluable patients (placebo: n = 24, dapagliflozin: n = 25; 53% males) had a mean age of 64.4 years, a body mass index of 30.2 kg/m2 and an HbA1c of 6.7%. Body weight and HbA1c were significantly decreased by dapagliflozin versus placebo. Dapagliflozin had no effect on myocardial efficiency, but external left ventricular (LV) work (-0.095 [-0.145, -0.043] J/g/min) and LV oxygen consumption were significantly reduced (-0.30 [-0.49, -0.12] J/g/min) by dapagliflozin, although the changes were not statistically significant versus changes in the placebo group. Change in left atrial maximal volume with dapagliflozin versus placebo was -3.19 (-6.32, -0.07) mL/m2 (p = .056). Peak global radial strain decreased with dapagliflozin versus placebo (-3.92% [-7.57%, -0.28%]; p = .035), while peak global longitudinal and circumferential strains were unchanged. Hepatic fatty acid uptake was increased by dapagliflozin versus placebo (0.024 [0.004, 0.044] mumol/g/min; p = .018), while cardiac uptake was unchanged.

   CONCLUSIONS: This exploratory study indicates reduced heart work but limited effects on myocardial function, efficiency and cardiac fatty acid uptake, while hepatic fatty acid uptake increased, after 6 weeks of treatment with dapagliflozin.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of oral glucokinase activator (GKA) in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched and collected randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of glucokinase activators in the treatment of T2DM from PubMed, ClinicalTrails, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and CNKI databases. Revman5.3 software was used to do the meta-analysis, and the Cochrane tool was used to evaluate the risk of bias in the included RCTs.

   RESULTS: Seven double-blind RTCs were included in the final analysis, with a total of 762 patients. For the efficacy, the meta-analysis found that GKAs lowed the levels of fasting blood glucose (FPG) (mean difference -0.71, 95% CI: -1.11 to -0.31, based on 459 patients from 5 works of literature) and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) (mean difference: -0.65%, 95% CI: -0.82 to -0.48, based on 570 patients from 4 works of literature). Subgroup analysis showed GKAs combined with metformin, but not used alone, reduced the levels of FPG. In terms of safety, GKAs did not affect the total rate of adverse events (AEs). GKAs did not affected the risks of diarrhea (RR 1.59, 95% CI: 0.7 to 3.65, p =0.26), headache (RR 0.96, 95% CI: 0.41-2.21, p =0.60), and nausea (RR 2.23, 95% CI: 0.55-9.12, p =0.24), but they increased the risk of hypoglycemia (RR 1.81, 95% CI: 1.35 to 2.42, p <0.0001, based on 570 patients from 4 literatures).

   CONCLUSIONS: Oral GKAs combined with metformin has an evident hypoglycemic effect on T2DM, and they seem to be relatively good tolerant. Further clinical studies are still necessary to explore its long-term efficacy and safety.

Abstract
  Patients with schizophrenia have exceedingly high rates of metabolic comorbidity including type 2 diabetes and lose 15-20 years of life due to cardiovascular diseases, with early accrual of cardiometabolic disease. In this study, thirty overweight or obese (Body Mass Index (BMI) > 25) participants under 40 years old with schizophrenia spectrum disorders and early comorbid prediabetes or type 2 diabetes receiving antipsychotic medications were randomized, in a double-blind fashion, to metformin 1500 mg/day or placebo (2:1 ratio; n = 21 metformin and n = 9 placebo) for 4 months. The primary outcome measures were improvements in glucose homeostasis (HbA1c, fasting glucose) and insulin resistance (Matsuda index-derived from oral glucose tolerance tests and homeostatic model of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR)). Secondary outcome measures included changes in weight, MRI measures of fat mass and distribution, symptom severity, cognition, and hippocampal volume. Twenty-two patients (n = 14 metformin; n = 8 placebo) completed the trial. The metformin group had a significant decrease over time in the HOMA-IR (p = 0.043) and fasting blood glucose (p = 0.007) vs. placebo. There were no differences between treatment groups in the Matsuda index, HbA1c, which could suggest liver-specific effects of metformin. There were no between group differences in other secondary outcome measures, while weight loss in the metformin arm correlated significantly with decreases in subcutaneous, but not visceral or hepatic adipose tissue. Our results show that metformin improved dysglycemia and insulin sensitivity, independent of weight loss, in a young population with prediabetes/diabetes and psychosis spectrum illness, that is at extremely high risk of early cardiovascular mortality. Trial Registration: This protocol was registered with clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02167620).

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Women with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus are at a substantially increased risk of gestational diabetes mellitus recurrence and type 2 diabetes. Weight gain, particularly increased central adiposity after delivery, is strongly associated with deterioration of pancreatic beta cell compensation for insulin resistance. Weight management after gestational diabetes mellitus could have a significant benefit in these women who are at a high risk of developing type 2 diabetes.

   OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the treatment efficacy of dapagliflozin and metformin, alone and in combination, on body weight and anthropometric, cardiovascular, and metabolic parameters in overweight women with a recent history of gestational diabetes mellitus.

   STUDY DESIGN: This was a prospective, single-blind, randomized, outpatient clinical trial with 3 parallel treatment groups. Overweight or obese (body mass index>25) females (n=66; >=18-45 years) with gestational diabetes mellitus in pregnancy in the past 12 months were randomized in a single-blind manner to dapagliflozin, metformin, or dapagliflozin-metformin for 24 weeks. Body weight, height, body mass index, waist circumference, waist-to-height ratio, and blood pressure were determined at baseline and trial completion. Oral glucose tolerance tests were performed at baseline and 24 weeks to assess glycemia and mean blood glucose and calculate insulin sensitivity and secretion measures. Plasma lipid fractions, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and liver enzymes were also assessed in the fasting sample at the beginning and completion of the study trial.

   RESULTS: The study was completed by 49 participants (74%). Significant reduction of weight, waist circumference, and waist-to-height ratio and improved glycemia and insulin sensitivity index derived from oral glucose tolerance test were found with dapagliflozin-metformin vs metformin monotherapy. Both dapagliflozin and dapagliflozin-metformin therapy were superior to metformin in increasing high-density lipoprotein levels, reducing triglyceride concentrations, lowering the triglyceride-to-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio, and improving glucose excursion after an oral glucose tolerance test. The early insulin response to a glucose challenge significantly improved with only dapagliflozin-metformin compared with single-drug treatments.

   CONCLUSION: This is the first report comparing the efficacy of a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor alone and in combination with metformin in this patient population. We found that combination dapagliflozin-metformin treatment over a 24-week period had a greater positive effect on body weight, waist circumference, and glycemic, cardiovascular, and metabolic parameters than metformin monotherapy in overweight or obese at-risk women with a recent history of gestational diabetes mellitus.

Abstract
  AIM: To assess the efficacy and safety of polyethylene glycol loxenatide (PEX168), a new glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, as an add-on to metformin therapy in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D).

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3b trial. After metformin monotherapy (>=1500 mg/day) for 8 weeks or more, patients with uncontrolled T2D (HbA1c of 7.0%-10.5%) from 44 sites were randomized (1:1:1) to metformin + placebo, metformin + PEX168 100 mug, and metformin + PEX168 200 mug. The core treatment period lasted for 24 weeks, followed by a 28-week extension period. The primary endpoint was the change in HbA1c levels at week 24. The main secondary endpoint was the proportion of patients with an HbA1c of less than 7.0% at week 24.

   RESULTS: The least-square mean (standard error) change in HbA1c levels was significantly greater (P < .001 for superiority) in the PEX168 groups (-1.16% [0.08%] and -1.14% [0.08%] with 100 and 200 mug, respectively) than in the placebo group (0.35% [0.08%]). The proportion of patients with an HbA1c of less than 7.0% at week 24 was significantly higher in the PEX168 100 mug (37.4%) and PEX168 200 mug (40.6%) groups than in the placebo group (16.8%; both P < .001). The gastrointestinal reactions were mild; the risks of hypoglycaemia and weight gain did not increase. Anti-PEX168 antibodies were noted in less than 2% of patients. No treatment-emergent serious adverse events occurred.

   CONCLUSION: The subcutaneous injection of PEX168 once a week can effectively, continuously and safely improve HbA1c levels in patients with T2D when combined with metformin. Copyright © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Abstract
  AIM: To examine the long-term efficacy of thiazolidinedione plus a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist versus basal-bolus insulin on glycaemic control and beta-cell function in patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes (T2D) on metformin plus sulphonylurea.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three hundred and thirty-one patients with poorly controlled T2D were recruited over 3 years and were followed for an additional year. Subjects received a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) at baseline and at study end. After completing the baseline OGTT, subjects were randomized to receive either pioglitazone plus weekly exenatide (combination therapy) or basal/bolus insulin (insulin therapy) to maintain an HbA1c of less than 7.0%. The primary outcome of the study was the difference in HbA1c at study end between the two treatment groups.

   RESULTS: Both therapies caused a robust decrease in HbA1c. However, combination therapy caused a greater decrement (-1.1%, P < .0001) than insulin therapy, and more subjects in the combination therapy group (86%) achieved the American Diabetes Association goal of glycaemic control (HbA1c < 7.0%) than those in the insulin therapy group (44%) (P < .0001). Both therapies improved insulin secretion. However, the improvement in insulin secretion with combination therapy was 2.5-fold greater (P < .001) than with insulin therapy (50%). Insulin therapy caused more weight gain and hypoglycaemia.

   CONCLUSION: Both combination therapy and insulin therapy effectively reduced HbA1c in poorly controlled T2D on multiple oral agents. However, combination therapy produced a greater improvement in insulin secretion and decrease in HbA1c with a lower risk of hypoglycaemia. Copyright © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Abstract
  AIM: To investigate the effect of sitagliptin (SITA) and metformin (MET) monotherapy as well as in combination (MET+SITA) on beta-cell function and insulin sensitivity in women with recent gestational diabetes (GDM) and impaired glucose regulation (IGR: impaired fasting glucose and/or impaired glucose tolerance).

   MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty women were randomly assigned to receive SITA (100 mg qd), MET (850 mg bid) or MET+SITA (50 + 850 mg bid) for 16 weeks. A 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and +125 mg/dL hyperglycaemic clamp followed by 5 g i.v. L-arginine were performed at baseline and end of study. The primary outcome of the study was the mean change in arginine-stimulated insulin secretion rate during the hyperglycaemic clamp test from baseline to 16-week therapy.

   RESULTS: At week 16, body mass index declined in all groups (-1.2 +/- 0.2 kg/m2 ; P < 0.05). MET+SITA gave a greater increase of first phase(2-10 min) insulin secretion and arginine-stimulated response (720.3 +/- 299.0 to 995.5 +/- 370.3 pmol/L and 3.2 +/- 0.6 to 4.8 +/- 1.0 pmoL/min, respectively, both P < 0.05) compared with MET and SITA. Similarly, MET+SITA was more effective in increasing OGTT-based glucose sensitivity (55.7 +/- 11.3 to 108 +/- 56.2 pmol x min-1 m-2 x mM-1 ; P = 0.04) and insulin-stimulated glucose disposal (M/I: 2.2 +/- 0.5 to 4.6 +/- 1.3 mg/kg/min/muIU/min/ml; P = 0.04; Matsuda index [SI]: 3.1 +/- 0.4 to 5.7 +/- 1.1; P = 0.03) compared with either MET or SITA. Disposition index (ISSI-2) increased with MET+SITA and SITA (both P < 0.05), while no significant change was observed in MET. Among MET+SITA women, 33% reverted to normal glucose tolerance (NGT) compared with 14% with MET and 7% with SITA (P < 0.05).

   CONCLUSION: This study shows that MET+SITA is superior to SITA and MET monotherapy regarding beta-cell function and insulin sensitivity improvement in IGR women with previous GDM, and may offer a potential pharmacologic intervention to reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes in this high-risk population.

Abstract
  AIM: Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibition has effects on both fasting and postprandial glucose. However, the extent of this effect over the whole day and whether different DPP-4 inhibitors have the same effects have not been established. We therefore explored the whole day effects of three different DPP-4 inhibitors versus placebo on glucose, islet and incretin hormones after ingestion of breakfast, lunch and dinner in subjects with metformin-treated and well-controlled type 2 diabetes.

   METHODS: The study was single-centre and crossover designed, involving 24 subjects [12 men, 12 women, mean age 63 years, body mass index 31.0 kg/m2 , glycated haemoglobin 44.7 mmol/mol (6.2%)], who underwent four test days in random order. Each whole day test included ingestion of standardized breakfast (525 kcal), lunch (780 kcal) and dinner (560 kcal) after intake of sitagliptin (100 mg) or vildagliptin (50 mg twice), or saxagliptin (5 mg) or placebo.

   RESULTS: Compared with placebo, DPP-4 inhibition reduced glucose levels, increased beta-cell function (insulin secretory rate in relation to glucose), suppressed glucagon, increased intact glucagon-like-peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) but suppressed total GLP-1 and GIP after all three meals. The effects were sustained throughout the daytime period with similar changes after each meal and did not differ between the DPP-4 inhibitors.

   CONCLUSIONS: DPP-4 inhibition has persistent daytime effects on glucose, islet and incretin hormones with no difference between three different DPP-4 inhibitors. Copyright © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Abstract
  AIMS: To evaluate whether there is a difference between the effects of dapagliflozin and gliclazide modified release (MR) on glycaemic variability (GV) and glycaemic control, as assessed by continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), in individuals with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: This randomized, open-label, active-controlled study was conducted in individuals with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes who were drug-naive or on steady-dose metformin monotherapy. Participants were treated once daily with 10 mg dapagliflozin or 120 mg gliclazide MR. CGM and GV index calculations were performed at baseline and after 12 weeks.

   RESULTS: In total, 97 participants (age 57.9 +/- 8.7 years, 50.5% men, baseline glycated haemoglobin 63 +/- 9.8 mmol/mol [7.9 +/- 0.9%]) were randomized, and 94 completed the 12-week protocol. Intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) analyses showed that the reduction in GV, as measured by the mean amplitude of glycaemic excursions, was superior in the dapagliflozin group versus the gliclazide MR group (-0.9 mmol/L [95% CI -1.5, -0.4] vs -0.2 mmol/L [95% CI -0.6, 0.3]; P = 0.030 [ITT]). The reductions in GV estimated by the coefficient of variation and SD were greater in the dapagliflozin group. Moreover, dapagliflozin increased the glucose time in range (TIR; 3.9-10 mmol/L) by 24.9% (95% CI 18.6, 31.2) vs. 17.4% (95% CI 11.6, 23.3) in the gliclazide MR group (P = 0.089 [ITT]; P = 0.041 [PP]).

   CONCLUSIONS: Dapagliflozin improved GV and increased TIR more efficiently than gliclazide MR in individuals with type 2 diabetes over 12 weeks, as demonstrated by CGM. Copyright © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Abstract
  AIM: To assess the efficacy of exenatide (EXE) once weekly + dapagliflozin once daily (DAPA) versus each drug alone in reducing biomarkers of fatty liver/steatosis and fibrosis in a post hoc analysis of DURATION-8, a 104-week study in 695 patients with type 2 diabetes uncontrolled by metformin monotherapy.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated the impact of the study treatments on non-invasive markers of hepatic steatosis (fatty liver index [FLI] and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [NAFLD] liver fat score), fibrosis (fibrosis-4 index [FIB-4]) and severe fibrosis (NAFLD fibrosis score), along with liver enzymes and insulin resistance, at weeks 28 and 52. All outcomes in this analysis were exploratory, with nominal P values reported.

   RESULTS: At week 28, biomarkers of fatty liver/steatosis and fibrosis were reduced from baseline in all treatment groups. At week 28, EXE once weekly + DAPA effects for decrease in FLI were stronger than those of EXE once weekly + placebo (PLB; -2.92, 95% confidence interval [CI] -5.11, -0.73; P = 0.0092) or DAPA+PLB (-2.77 [95% CI -4.93, -0.62]; P = 0.0119), and stronger than those of EXE once weekly + PLB at week 52 (-3.23 [95% CI -5.79, -0.68]; P = 0.0134). FIB-4 showed reduction versus baseline only in the EXE once weekly + DAPA group at both week 28 (-0.06 [95% CI -0.11, -0.01]; P = 0.0135) and week 52 (-0.05 [95% CI -0.09, -0.004]; P = 0.0308).

   CONCLUSIONS: The EXE once weekly + DAPA combination showed stronger effects than EXE once weekly + PLB or DAPA + PLB in ameliorating markers of hepatic steatosis and fibrosis in patients with type 2 diabetes. Prospective trials are needed to validate these findings. Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Abstract
  AIM: To assess the comparative effects of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, sulphonylureas (SUs) and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors on cardiometabolic risk factors in routine care.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using primary care data on 10 631 new users of SUs, SGLT2 inhibitors or DPP-4 inhibitors added to metformin, obtained from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink, we created propensity-score matched cohorts and used linear mixed models to describe changes in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), systolic blood pressure (BP) and body mass index (BMI) over 96 weeks.

   RESULTS: HbA1c levels fell substantially after treatment intensification for all drugs: mean change at week 12: SGLT2 inhibitors: -15.2 mmol/mol (95% confidence interval [CI] -16.9, -13.5); SUs: -14.3 mmol/mol (95% CI -15.5, -13.2); and DPP-4 inhibitors: -11.9 mmol/mol (95% CI -13.1, -10.6). Systolic BP fell for SGLT2 inhibitor users throughout follow-up, but not for DPP-4 inhibitor or SU users: mean change at week 12: SGLT2 inhibitors: -2.3 mmHg (95% CI -3.8, -0.8); SUs: -0.8 mmHg (95% CI -1.9, +0.4); and DPP-4 inhibitors: -0.9 mmHg (95% CI -2.1,+0.2). BMI decreased for SGLT2 inhibitor and DPP-4 inhibitor users, but not SU users: mean change at week 12: SGLT2 inhibitors: -0.7 kg/m2 (95% CI -0.9, -0.5); SUs: 0.0 kg/m2 (95% CI -0.3, +0.2); and DPP-4 inhibitors: -0.3 kg/m2 (95% CI -0.5, -0.1). eGFR fell at 12 weeks for SGLT2 inhibitor and DPP-4 inhibitor users. At 60 weeks, the fall in eGFR from baseline was similar for each drug class.

   CONCLUSIONS: In routine care, SGLT2 inhibitors had greater effects on cardiometabolic risk factors than SUs. Routine care data closely replicated the effects of diabetes drugs on physiological variables measured in clinical trials. Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

Abstract
  AIM: To determine the glucose-independent effect of the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor linagliptin versus the sulphonylurea glimepiride on systemic haemodynamics in the fasting and postprandial state in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D).

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prespecified secondary analysis of a phase IV, double-blind trial, 46 metformin-treated, overweight patients with T2D were included and randomly assigned (1:1) to once-daily linagliptin (5 mg) or glimepiride (1 mg) for 8 weeks. In a sub-study involving 26 patients, systemic haemodynamics were also assessed following a standardized liquid meal (Nutridrink Yoghurt style). Systemic haemodynamics (oscillometric device and finger photoplethysmography), arterial stiffness (applanation tonometry) and cardiac sympathovagal balance (heart rate variability [HRV]) were measured in the fasting state and repetitively following the meal. Ewing tests were performed in the fasting state.

   RESULTS: From baseline to week 8, linagliptin compared with glimepiride did not affect systemic haemodynamics, arterial stiffness or HRV in the fasting state. Linagliptin increased parasympathetic nervous activity, as measured by the Valsalva manoeuvre (P = .021) and deep breathing test (P = .027) compared with glimepiride. Postprandially, systolic blood pressure (SBP) dropped an average of 7.6 +/- 1.6 mmHg. Linagliptin reduced this decrease to 0.7 +/- 2.3 mmHg, which was significant to glimepiride (P = .010).

   CONCLUSIONS: When compared with glimepiride, linagliptin does not affect fasting blood pressure. However, linagliptin blunted the postprandial drop in SBP, which could benefit patients with postprandial hypotension. Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

Abstract
  We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety profile of lobeglitazone compared with sitagliptin as an add-on to metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes as well as other components of metabolic syndrome. Patients inadequately controlled by metformin were randomly assigned to lobeglitazone (0.5 mg, n = 121) or sitagliptin (100 mg, n = 126) for 24 weeks. The mean changes in HbA1c of the lobeglitazone and sitagliptin groups were -0.79% and -0.86%, respectively; the between-group difference was 0.08% (95% confidence interval, -0.14% to 0.30%), showing non-inferiority. The proportion of patients having two or more factors of other metabolic syndrome components decreased to a greater extent in the lobeglitazone group than in the sitagliptin group (-11.9% vs. -4.8%; P < .0174). Favourable changes in the lipid metabolism were also observed with lobeglitazone, which had a similar safety profile to sitagliptin. Lobeglitazone was comparable with sitagliptin as an add-on to metformin in terms of efficacy and safety. Copyright © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Abstract
  Globally, nearly half of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) do not successfully achieve target HbA1c with basal insulin, despite meeting fasting plasma glucose (FPG) targets. In this post hoc analysis of the LixiLan-L study, we determined whether iGlarLixi, a fixed-ratio combination of insulin glargine Gla-100 (iGlar) and the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist lixisenatide (Lixi), addresses the challenge of reducing residual hyperglycaemia in patients with T2D. In LixiLan-L, a randomized, open-label study, 1018 patients with T2D on basal insulin for >=6 months +/- oral antidiabetes drugs entered a 6-week run-in period, during which they were switched to and/or optimized for a daily dose of iGlar while continuing only metformin. Following the run-in period, 736 patients were then randomized to receive iGlarLixi or were continued on iGlar for 30 weeks +/- metformin. Residual hyperglycaemia was defined as HbA1c >= 7.0% despite FPG of <140 mg/dL. The proportion of patients with residual hyperglycaemia was similar in both treatment arms at screening (~~42%), and increased after the run-in period (~~62%). After 30 weeks, the proportion of patients with residual hyperglycaemia declined to 23.8% in the iGlarLixi versus 47.1% in the iGlar arm (P < .0001). The proportion of patients achieving both HbA1c (<7.0%) and FPG (<140 mg/dL) targets was higher in the iGlarLixi compared with the iGlar arm (50.3% vs. 27.4%, respectively; P < .0001). iGlarLixi effectively reduces residual hyperglycaemia in patients with T2D on basal insulin therapy.

Abstract
  AIM: To evaluate the efficacy of iGlarLixi by C-peptide levels and duration of diabetes in an exploratory analysis of the LixiLan-G study.

   METHODS: LixiLan-G was a 26-week, randomized, open-label study in adults with type diabetes (T2D) inadequately controlled while on a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA), with metformin, with or without pioglitazone and/or a sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor. This analysis investigated the efficacy of switching to iGlarLixi by fasting baseline quartile C-peptide levels and baseline quartile of duration of T2D compared with continued GLP-1 RA use.

   RESULTS: Change in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) from baseline to week 26 was significantly greater with iGlarLixi compared with continued GLP-1 RAs across all fasting C-peptide quartiles (-1.00% to -1.06% vs. -0.23% to -0.54% range, respectively) and irrespective of all T2D duration quartiles (-0.94% to -1.07% vs. -0.25% to -0.50% range). A significantly greater proportion of participants in the iGlarLixi arm achieved an HbA1c of <7% across all C-peptide quartiles (51%-73% range) than in the GLP-1 RA arm (19%-32% range). The greatest reductions in HbA1c in participants receiving iGlarLixi were observed in those with the shortest duration of disease, although consistently greater than reductions observed with continued GLP-1 RAs. Reductions in HbA1c were comparable across C-peptide quartiles within the iGlarLixi arm.

   CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that iGlarLixi is an effective treatment option, irrespective of C-peptide levels or duration of diabetes, in adults with insufficiently controlled T2D receiving GLP-1 RAs.

Abstract
  Metformin plus a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (DPP-4i) is the most common therapy for Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes. This 24-week, multicentre, open-label, parallel-group trial randomized patients on dual therapy to add-on tofogliflozin (20 mg/day, n = 33) or glimepiride (0.5 mg/day, n = 31). The primary outcome was change in body fat percentage. The secondary outcomes included changes in HbA1c, fat mass, fat-free mass, liver function variables and uric acid. Tofogliflozin and glimepiride reduced HbA1c to a similar extent. Body fat percentage did not change from baseline in either group. Fat mass was reduced by tofogliflozin but was increased by glimepiride (by -2.0 +/- 1.7 kg and +1.6 +/- 1.6 kg, P = .002). Fat-free mass was also reduced by tofogliflozin and increased by glimepiride (by -1.3 +/- 1.3 kg and +0.9 +/- 2.0 kg, P < .001). Alanine aminotransferase and uric acid levels were reduced by tofogliflozin (P = .006 and P < .001, respectively). These data provide novel information useful for selecting the third oral agent for patients whose diabetes is inadequately controlled with metformin plus DPP-4i dual therapy.

Abstract
  AIMS: To determine the optimal dose(s) of once-monthly administration of efpeglenatide, a long-acting glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA), in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) inadequately controlled on metformin.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this phase 2, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial (NCT02081118), patients were randomized 1:1:1:1 to subcutaneous efpeglenatide (8, 12 or 16 mg once monthly; n = 158) or placebo (n = 51). The 16-week treatment period included a 4-week titration phase with once-weekly efpeglenatide 4 mg, followed by one dose of efpeglenatide 8 mg once monthly and two doses of the assigned once-monthly dose. The primary endpoint was change in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) from baseline to week 17.

   RESULTS: All efpeglenatide doses significantly reduced HbA1c versus placebo (P < 0.0001 for all). Overall, the least squares mean difference in HbA1c reductions between efpeglenatide and placebo was -7.7 mmol/mol (-0.71%; baseline to week 17). At week 17, a significantly greater proportion of efpeglenatide patients had an HbA1c level <53 mmol/mol (<7%) versus placebo (48.7% vs. 30.6%; P = 0.0320). Significant body weight loss occurred across all efpeglenatide doses (placebo-corrected reduction -2.0 kg [efpeglenatide overall]; P = 0.0003). The safety profile was consistent with GLP-1RAs, with gastrointestinal (GI) disorders being the most common treatment-emergent adverse events. Fluctuations in effects on glucose levels and rates of GI events occurred between peak and trough efpeglenatide concentrations.

   CONCLUSIONS: Efpeglenatide once monthly (following once-weekly titration) has significant benefits with regard to HbA1c and weight reduction versus placebo in patients with T2D. Further studies are needed to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of efpeglenatide once monthly. Copyright © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Abstract
  AIMS: To assess efficacy and safety of fixed-ratio (1:1) combination insulin glargine and lixisenatide (iGlarLixi) compared to insulin glargine U100 (iGlar), with metformin, in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) inadequately controlled on basal insulin and oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs).

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: This 26-week, randomized, open-label study compared iGlarLixi to iGlar, both with metformin in adult Japanese patients with T2DM and hemoglobin (Hb) A1c >=7.5% to <=9.5%, treated with basal insulin and 1 or 2 OADs. Five hundred and twelve patients were randomized after a 12-week run-in, when iGlar was introduced and/or further titrated and OADs other than metformin were stopped. The primary endpoint was change in HbA1c from baseline to week 26.

   RESULTS: iGlarLixi (n = 255) demonstrated significantly greater reductions in HbA1c (-1.27%) than iGlar (n = 257, -0.53%) (LS mean difference: -0.74%, P < .0001) at week 26, confirming the superiority of iGlarLixi. Significantly, more iGlarLixi patients reached target HbA1c <7% at week 26 (51.8% vs 16.0% for iGlar). iGlarLixi patients lost weight in contrast to iGlar patients (-0.51 kg vs +0.55 kg). Documented symptomatic hypoglycemia (plasma glucose <= 3.9 mmol/L) was observed in 18.8% of iGlarLixi patients vs 16.7% of iGlar patients. iGlarLixi patients had more gastrointestinal-related adverse events than iGlar patients (33.3% vs 8.6%), primarily nausea (16.9% vs 0.8%). However, the treatment was generally well-tolerated.

   CONCLUSIONS: A once-daily injection of iGlarLixi with metformin is an effective, well-tolerated, and simple therapeutic intervention providing significant improvement in glycemic control in Japanese patients with T2DM inadequately controlled on basal insulin and up to two OADs.

Abstract
  AIM: To assess the effects of dapagliflozin plus saxagliptin plus metformin versus glimepiride plus metformin on liver fat (proton density fat fraction) and visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue volumes over 52 weeks of treatment.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a magnetic resonance imaging substudy of a 52-week, multicentre, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial that evaluated the efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin 10 mg/day plus saxagliptin 5 mg/day versus titrated glimepiride 1-6 mg (1, 2, 3, 4 or 6 mg) in 82 patients with type 2 diabetes (HbA1c 7.5%-10.5%) on metformin >=1500 mg/day background. Analyses were exploratory and not controlled for multiplicity; P-values are nominal.

   RESULTS: Magnetic resonance imaging was performed on 59 patients; liver fat and adipose tissue volumes were analysed for 59 and 57 patients, respectively. There was a significant >30% reduction from baseline in liver fat (P = 0.007) and >10% reduction in adipose tissue volumes (P < 0.01) with dapagliflozin plus saxagliptin plus metformin at week 52 versus glimepiride plus metformin. In the full-study population, dapagliflozin plus saxagliptin plus metformin decreased body weight and serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels over 52 weeks.

   CONCLUSIONS: Dapagliflozin plus saxagliptin significantly decreased liver fat and adipose tissue volume versus glimepiride, and reduced serum liver enzyme levels, indicating a favourable metabolic profile of dapagliflozin plus saxagliptin in patients with type 2 diabetes on metformin therapy.

Abstract
  AIMS: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin (DAPA) + saxagliptin (SAXA) compared with glimepiride (GLIM) in patients with type 2 diabetes who were inadequately controlled [glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) 7.5-10.5% (58-91 mmol/mol)] on metformin monotherapy.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: This 52-week, multicentre, double-blind, active-controlled study (NCT02419612) randomized (1:1) patients on metformin to add-on DAPA 10 mg + SAXA 5 mg (n = 227) or GLIM 1-6 mg (titrated; n = 217). The primary efficacy endpoint was change in HbA1c from baseline to week 52.

   RESULTS: Baseline mean +/- standard deviation of age, duration of diabetes and HbA1c were 56.1 +/- 9.7 years, 7.8 +/- 6.4 years and 8.5% +/- 0.8% (69 +/- 9.0 mmol/mol), respectively. Adjusted mean change from baseline in HbA1c was -1.35% (-14.8 mmol/mol) with DAPA + SAXA versus -0.98% (-10.7 mmol/mol) with GLIM (P <0.001). Changes from baseline in body weight and systolic blood pressure were -3.1 kg and -2.6 mmHg with DAPA + SAXA versus +1.0 kg (P <0.001) and +1.0 mmHg (P = 0.007) with GLIM. More patients achieved HbA1c <7.0% (53 mmol/mol) (44.3% vs. 34.3%; P = 0.044), and fewer patients required treatment intensification (1.3% vs. 8.8%; P = 0.002) with DAPA + SAXA than with GLIM.

   CONCLUSIONS: Compared with GLIM, concurrent addition of DAPA + SAXA significantly improved glycaemic control, body weight and other metabolic parameters in patients inadequately controlled on metformin.

Abstract
  AIM: To investigate the efficacy and safety of initiating insulin degludec/liraglutide (IDegLira) in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) who had discontinued pretrial sulphonylureas (SUs) or dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4is) versus patients not previously treated with these regimens.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: In DUAL II, patients with T2D uncontrolled on basal insulin and metformin +/- SU/glinides were randomized to insulin degludec or IDegLira (both capped at 50 U). In DUAL IX, patients were randomized to insulin glargine U100 (no maximum dose) or IDegLira, as add-on to sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors +/- oral antidiabetic drugs. In this post hoc analysis, patients were grouped according to pretrial use of SU (DUAL II) or DPP4i (DUAL IX).

   RESULTS: Regardless of pretrial SU/DPP4i use, IDegLira was favourable versus insulin comparators with respect to change in HbA1c and body weight. Lower hypoglycaemia rates and comparable end-of-trial daily insulin dose were achieved with IDegLira, regardless of pretrial regimen. There was no clinically relevant increase in mean self-measured blood glucose in the early weeks after IDegLira initiation. There was no statistically significant interaction between the randomized treatments and previous SU/DPP4i use.

   CONCLUSIONS: IDegLira was more favourable compared with degludec or glargine U100 in terms of change in HbA1c and body weight, regardless of antecedent treatment. Clinicians should be aware of a potential transient rise in self-measured blood glucose when transitioning therapy in patients. This shows that SUs/DPP4is can be safely discontinued, without deterioration in glycaemic control when initiating IDegLira, allowing a simplified treatment regimen. Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Abstract
  AIM: To examine the glucose-lowering mechanisms of the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist lixisenatide after two subsequent meals and in combination with basal insulin.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-eight metformin-treated patients with type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned to treatment sequences with either lixisenatide or insulin glargine alone for 4 weeks, and a combination of both treatments for 4 weeks. Metabolic examinations were performed before and after each treatment period following breakfast and a late lunch 8 hours later.

   RESULTS: Lixisenatide mainly reduced postprandial glycaemia, while insulin glargine mainly reduced fasting glucose after breakfast (P < 0.05). This was partially preserved after a late lunch (P < 0.05). After breakfast, lixisenatide reduced insulin secretion and glucagon levels significantly. These effects were lost after a late lunch. Insulin glargine did not significantly reduce glucagon or insulin secretion. Gastric emptying was slowed by lixisenatide, but not by insulin glargine after breakfast. After the late lunch, lixisenatide slightly accelerated gastric emptying.

   CONCLUSIONS: Lixisenatide decelerates gastric emptying after breakfast, thereby reducing glycaemic excursions, insulin secretion and glucagon levels. The glycaemic reduction persists until after a late lunch, despite accelerated gastric emptying. The combination with insulin glargine enhances the glucose-lowering effect because of complementary modes of action. Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Abstract
  AIMS: In the EMPA-REG OUTCOME R trial, the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor empagliflozin when given in addition to standard care improved cardiovascular (CV) and renal outcomes, and reduced mortality. Trial participants were on a variety of glucose-lowering therapies at baseline, some of which could potentially affect CV risk. This analysis investigated whether the use of background diabetes therapy affected the risk of CV death, hospitalizations for heart failure, and progression of chronic kidney disease, among patients treated with empagliflozin.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria were randomized to placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg or empagliflozin 25 mg; glucose-lowering therapy was to remain unchanged for 12 weeks and then adjusted to achieve glycaemic control according to local guidelines. Differences in risk of cardio-renal outcomes between empagliflozin and placebo by baseline use of metformin, sulphonylurea (SU) and insulin were assessed using a Cox proportional hazards model.

   RESULTS: Of 7020 eligible patients, 74% were receiving metformin, 43% SU and 48% insulin at baseline (each alone or in combination); the most common regimens were metformin plus SU (20%) and metformin plus insulin (20%). Empagliflozin reduced the risk of CV death irrespective of the use of: metformin [with: hazard ratio (HR) 0.71 (95% confidence interval, CI, 0.54-0.94); without: 0.46 (0.32-0.68); Pinteraction = 0.07]; SU [with: HR 0.64 (0.44-0.92); without: 0.61 (0.46-0.81); Pinteraction = 0.85]; or insulin [with: HR 0.63 (0.46-0.85); without: 0.61 (0.44-0.85); Pinteraction = 0.92]. Reductions in three-point major adverse CV events, hospitalizations for heart failure, and all-cause mortality were consistent across subgroups of baseline therapies. Empagliflozin reduced the risks of incident or worsening nephropathy versus placebo irrespective of the use of SU or insulin at baseline (Pinteraction > 0.05), but there was a greater reduction in this risk for patients not using metformin [HR 0.47 (95% CI 0.37-0.59)] versus those using metformin [HR 0.68 (95% CI 0.58-0.79)] at baseline (Pinteraction = 0.01).

   CONCLUSIONS: The addition of empagliflozin to antihyperglycaemic regimens of patients with type 2 diabetes and CV disease consistently reduced their risks of adverse CV outcomes and mortality irrespective of baseline use of metformin, SU or insulin. For chronic kidney disease progression, there may be a larger benefit from empagliflozin in those patients who are not using metformin. Copyright © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Abstract
  AIM: To evaluate the effects of the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor vildagliptin on glycaemic and energy expenditure responses during intraduodenal fat infusion, as well as the contribution of endogenous glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) signalling, in people with type 2 diabetes (T2DM).

   METHODS: A total of 15 people with T2DM managed by diet and/or metformin (glycated haemoglobin 49.3 +/- 2.1 mmol/mol) were studied on three occasions (two with vildagliptin and one with placebo) in a double-blind, randomized, crossover fashion. On each day, vildagliptin 50 mg or placebo was given orally, followed by intravenous exendin (9-39) 600 pmol/kg/min, on one of the two vildagliptin treatment days, or 0.9% saline over 180 minutes. At between 0 and 120 minutes, a fat emulsion was infused intraduodenally at 2 kcal/min. Energy expenditure, plasma glucose and glucose-regulatory hormones were evaluated.

   RESULTS: Intraduodenal fat increased plasma GLP-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), insulin and glucagon, and energy expenditure, and decreased plasma glucose (all P < 0.05). On the two intravenous saline days, plasma glucose and glucagon were lower, plasma intact GLP-1 was higher (all P < 0.05), and energy expenditure tended to be lower after vildagliptin (P = 0.08) than placebo. On the two vildagliptin days, plasma glucose, glucagon and GLP-1 (both total and intact), and energy expenditure were higher during intravenous exendin (9-39) than saline (all P < 0.05).

   CONCLUSIONS: In well-controlled T2DM during intraduodenal fat infusion, vildagliptin lowered plasma glucose and glucagon, and tended to decrease energy expenditure, effects that were mediated by endogenous GLP-1. Copyright © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: Sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) levels are reported to be inversely associated with diabetes risk. It is unknown whether diabetes prevention interventions increase SHBG and whether resultant changes in SHBG affect diabetes risk. The purpose of this analysis was to determine whether intensive lifestyle intervention (ILS) or metformin changed circulating SHBG and if resultant changes influenced diabetes risk in the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP).

   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This is a secondary analysis from the DPP (1996-2001), a randomized trial of ILS or metformin versus placebo on diabetes risk over a mean follow-up of 3.2 years. The DPP was conducted across 27 academic study centers in the USA. Men, premenopausal and postmenopausal women without hormone use in the DPP were evaluated. The DPP included overweight/obese persons with elevated fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance. Main outcomes measures were changes in SHBG levels at 1 year and risk of diabetes over 3 years.

   RESULTS: ILS resulted in significantly higher increases (postmenopausal women: p<0.01) or smaller decrements (men: p<0.05; premenopausal women: p<0.01) in SHBG compared with placebo or metformin. Changes in SHBG were primarily attributable to changes in adiposity. There were no consistent associations of change in SHBG with the risk of diabetes by treatment arm or participant group.

   CONCLUSIONS: Lifestyle intervention may be associated with favorable changes in circulating SHBG, which is largely due to changes in adiposity. Changes in circulating SHBG do not independently predict reductions in diabetes incidence. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No commercial re-use.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: Limited information was available regarding the perioperative outcomes in patients with and without use of metformin. This study aims to evaluate the complications and mortality after major surgery in patients with diabetes who use metformin.

   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using a real-world database of Taiwan's National Health Insurance from 2008 to 2013, we conducted a matched cohort study of 91 356 patients with diabetes aged >20 years who used metformin and later underwent major surgery. Using a propensity score-matching technique adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics, medical condition, surgery type, and anesthesia type, 91 356 controls who underwent surgery but did not use metformin were selected. Logistic regression was used to calculate the ORs with 95% CIs for postoperative complications and 30-day mortality associated with metformin use.

   RESULTS: Patients who used metformin had a lower risk of postoperative septicemia (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.90 to 0.98), acute renal failure (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.96), and 30-day mortality (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.88) compared with patients who did not use metformin, in both sexes and in every age group. Metformin users who underwent surgery also had a decreased risk of postoperative intensive care unit admission (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.62) and lower medical expenditures (p<0.0001) than non-use controls.

   CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with diabetes, those who used metformin and underwent major surgery had a lower risk of complications and mortality compared with non-users. Further randomized clinical trials are needed to show direct evidence of how metformin improves perioperative outcomes. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: To investigate long-term metformin adherence in the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS) by examining: (1) predictors of long-term adherence to study metformin and (2) whether metformin adherence was associated with incident type 2 diabetes.

   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: DPPOS was an open-label continuation of the randomized clinical trial (Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP)) in which eligible participants randomized to the metformin group were offered study metformin and followed over 11 years. A brief structured adherence interview was administered semiannually. Metformin adherence was assessed by pill counts. Predictors of metformin adherence were examined in multivariate regression models. Incident diabetes associated with metformin adherence and other variables was assessed in Cox proportional hazards models.

   RESULTS: Of 868 participants eligible to continue taking study metformin, 664 (76%) took at least some metformin over 11 years, with 478 of them reporting problems with adherence. DPPOS cumulative adherence showed significant associations of higher adherence (>=80%) with early adherence at 3 months in DPP (p<0.001) and lower depression scores during DPPOS (p<0.001); significant differences were also seen by race/ethnicity (p<0.004). Predicting adherence by multivariate modeling showed odds of adherence significantly lower for Black participants and for participants reporting more than one barrier. Odds for adherence were significantly higher for those adherent early in DPP and those reporting at least one planned strategy to improve adherence. Higher metformin adherence was significantly associated with a lower diabetes risk (p=0.04), even after adjustment for demographic variables, depression, and anxiety scores.

   CONCLUSIONS: In this long-term diabetes prevention study, early metformin adherence and planned strategies to promote adherence improved long-term adherence over 11 years; higher adherence to metformin was related to lower diabetes incidence. Incorporating strategies to promote adherence when initially prescribing metformin and counseling to support adherence over time are warranted. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: Empagliflozin reduced morbidity and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in clinical trials. A registry study was undertaken to describe evolution of patient characteristics and assess the real-world effectiveness/safety of empagliflozin.

   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Data from the Diabetes Patienten Verlaufsdokumentation (DPV)/Diabetes Versorgungsevaluation (DIVE) registries on 9571 adults with T2DM (registered in 2014-2019) receiving empagliflozin were used. Patients were grouped according to the following: early users (group 1; n=505) received empagliflozin before the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study publication (mid-September 2015); intermediate users (group 2; n=2961) started empagliflozin after the EMPA-REG OUTCOME publication but before the European Medicines Agency label change (from mid-September 2015 to mid-January 2017); and late users (group 3; n=6105) started empagliflozin after mid-January 2017. Data on clinical and treatment characteristics were collected.

   RESULTS: Over time, the proportion of recipients aged <65 years decreased (71.1% vs 54.4% among early and late adopters), male patients increased (from 50.9% to 66.5%), body mass index (mean+/-SD) decreased (from 35.5+/-6.7 to 32.7+/-6.6 kg/m2), proportion with cardiovascular morbidities increased (from 20.4% to 26.4%), and mean estimated glomerular filtration rate decreased (from 83.2+/-19.5 to 78.5+/-21.1 mL/min/1.73 m2) (all p<0.001). Patients increasingly received empagliflozin in combination with metformin (60.8% vs 68.6% of early and late adopters; p<0.001), glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists (11.0 vs 14.1%; p<0.001) or insulin (34.3% vs 49.9%; p<0.001). Empagliflozin was generally added to existing antidiabetic regimens. Six months after empagliflozin initiation, the mean glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) decreased by 0.4%, the proportion of patients with HbA1c <6.5% increased (19.2% vs 12.8%), and the mean fasting plasma glucose decreased (155.8+/-49.7 vs 168.0+/-55.1 mg/dL) (all p<0.001). No significant changes in rates of severe hypoglycemia and no cases of diabetic ketoacidosis were seen.

   CONCLUSIONS: Over time, empagliflozin is being prescribed to a broader patient range in routine practice, is usually added to existing antidiabetic regimens, and is increasingly used in combination with metformin, GLP-1 agonists and/or insulin. Empagliflozin had a beneficial effect on glycemic control, with no increase in hypoglycemia. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No commercial re-use.

Abstract
  THE KIDNEY DISEASE: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Clinical Practice Guideline for Diabetes Management in Chronic Kidney Disease represents the first KDIGO guideline on this subject. The guideline comes at a time when advances in diabetes technology and therapeutics offer new options to manage the large population of patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) at high risk of poor health outcomes. An enlarging base of high-quality evidence from randomized clinical trials is available to evaluate important new treatments offering organ protection, such as sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists. The goal of the new guideline is to provide evidence-based recommendations to optimize the clinical care of people with diabetes and CKD by integrating new options with existing management strategies. In addition, the guideline contains practice points to facilitate implementation when insufficient data are available to make well-justified recommendations or when additional guidance may be useful for clinical application. The guideline covers comprehensive care of patients with diabetes and CKD, glycemic monitoring and targets, lifestyle interventions, antihyperglycemic therapies, and self-management and health systems approaches to management of patients with diabetes and CKD.

Abstract
  PURPOSE: Compared with newer prandial anti-diabetes agents, repaglinide and acarbose are unique in being globally available in generic versions, being oral, and being the cheapest of all. The aim of this study was to compare their efficacy when used alone or in combination.

   METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind, prospective study, 358 recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients, who on a combined therapy with metformin and insulin glargine had a fasting plasma glucose (FGP) of <7.2 mmol/L but a 2-h postprandial plasma glucose (2hPPG) >10 mmol/L, were assigned to three groups of additional treatment with either repaglinide, acarbose, or repaglinide-plus-acarbose for 4 months.

   RESULTS: With intention-to-treat analysis, 63% of repaglinide group, 45.4 percent of acarbose group, and 75.7% of repaglinide-plus-acarbose group reached the primary endpoint of 2hPPG < 10 mmol/L while maintaining FPG < 7.2 mmol/L. Treatment adherence rate was 75.6% with repaglinide, 61.4% with acarbose, and 81.3% with repaglinide-plus-acarbose (p = 0.001). Among the groups, weight was significantly lower in acarbose group (p < 0.05). Twenty-one percent of repaglinide patients, 4.9% of acarbose subjects, and 10.3% of repaglinide-plus-acarbose cases reported at least one episode of hypoglycemia (p < 0.005). HbA1C and basal insulin requirement were significantly lower in repaglinide group (p = 0.004, p = 0.0002). Triglycerides were lowest in acarbose group (p = 0.005).

   CONCLUSIONS: Both acarbose and repaglinide were vastly effective in lowering postprandial hyperglycemia of recently diagnosed T2D. When combined, they were even more efficacious and the disease had a better outcome. Compared with newer peers, these two are particularly useful where and when cost consideration in diabetes treatment is a prime concern.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: Many African-Americans (AA) with obesity with newly diagnosed diabetes presenting with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or severe hyperglycemia (SH) discontinue insulin therapy and achieve near-normoglycemia remission (hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) <7%, fasting blood glucose (FBG) <130 mg/dL) and able to be managed on oral antidiabetic agents (OAD) during follow-up. Using combined data from two randomized controlled trials, we assessed long-term carbohydrate tolerance and changes in insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion.

   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Seventy-five participants with DKA (n=33) and SH (n=42) underwent 2-hour 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) after insulin discontinuation and every 6 months until hyperglycemia relapse (FBG >=130 mg/dL, HbA1c >7% or two random BG >=180 mg/dL) while treated with OAD (metformin, sitagliptin or pioglitazone) or placebo. Glucose tolerance status was defined as per the American Diabetes Association. Sensitivity index (Si) was calculated by oral minimal model, insulin secretion as the incremental area under the curve of insulin (IncreAUCi) and disposition index (DI) as SixIncreAUCi.

   RESULTS: During remission, OGTT showed normal glucose tolerance (NGT) (n=9 (12%)), prediabetes (n=34 (45%)) and diabetes (n=32 (43%)). DI and Si were higher in patients with NGT versus prediabetes versus diabetes (p<0.001), while IncreAUCi was not significantly different among NGT, prediabetes and diabetes (p=0.14). Achieving NGT status did not prolong near-normoglycemia remission. OAD treatment significantly prolonged hyperglycemia relapse-free survival (log-rank p=0.0012) compared with placebo and was associated with lower hyperglycemia relapse (HR: 0.45, 95% CI: (0.21 to 0.96), p=0.04).

   CONCLUSIONS: In AA patients with obesity with history of DKA and SH, near-normoglycemia remission is associated with improved insulin secretion and action with half of patients achieving NGT or prediabetes, and only half having diabetes on OGTT. NGT and prediabetes on OGTT were not associated with prolonged hyperglycemia relapse-free survival.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of vitamin B12 deficiency in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) on metformin and without metformin.

   METHODOLOGY: Between May 2018 and January 2019, this prospective multicenter observational study recruited participants from seven centers in four provinces of Pakistan (Sindh, Punjab, Baluchistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa). Participants with T2DM treated with metformin for >2 years and those not on metformin underwent assessment of hemoglobin, vitamin B12, homocysteine and diabetic neuropathy (vibration perception threshold (VPT) >15V) and painful diabetic neuropathy (Douleur Neuropathique 4 (DN4) >=4) and Diabetic Neuropathy Symptom (DNS) score >=1.

   RESULTS: Of 932 subjects, 645 (69.2%) were treated with metformin, while 287 (30.8%) were not on metformin. Overall, B12 deficiency (<200 pg/mL) was significantly higher in metformin users of 25 (3.9%), compared with non-metformin users of 6 (2.1%), while B12 insufficiency (200-300 pg/mL) was significantly lower in metformin users of 117 (18.4%) compared with non-metformin users of 80 (27.9%). Subjects with B12 deficiency and insufficiency with hyperhomocysteinemia (>=15) were found in 19 (76%) micromol/L and 69 (60.5%) micromol/L in metformin users compared with 6 (100%) micromol/L and 57 (73.1%) mumol/L in non-metformin users, respectively. VPT>25 and DN4 score >=4 were significantly higher in B12-deficient metformin users compared with non-metformin users. Similarly, DNS score >=1 was non-significantly higher in B12-deficient metformin users compared with non-metformin users.

   CONCLUSION: This study shows that vitamin B12 insufficiency was frequently found in our population and may progress into B12 deficiency. It is also associated with neuropathy in subjects on metformin. Further interventional studies to assess the benefit of B12 treatment on painful neuropathy in patients on metformin may be warranted. B12 levels may be checked in people with T2DM using metformin for >2 years. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No commercial re-use.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Accumulating evidence suggests that the metabolic effects of metformin and fermentable fibers are mediated, in part, through diverging or overlapping effects on the composition and metabolic functions of the gut microbiome. Pre-clinical animal models have established that the addition of fiber to metformin monotherapy improves glucose tolerance. However, possible synergistic effects of combination therapy (metformin plus fiber) have not been investigated in humans. Moreover, the underlying mechanisms of synergy have yet to be elucidated. The aim of this study is to compare in adolescents with obesity the metabolic effects of metformin and fermentable fibers in combination with those of metformin or fiber alone. We will also determine if therapeutic responses correlate with compositional and functional features of the gut microbiome.

   METHODS: This is a parallel three-armed, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial. Adolescents (aged 12-18 years) with obesity, insulin resistance (IR), and a family history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) will receive either metformin (850 mg p.o. twice/day), fermentable fibers (35 g/day), or a combination of metformin plus fiber for 12 months. Participants will be seen at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months, with a phone follow-up at 1 and 9 months. Primary and secondary outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 6, and 12 months. The primary outcome is change in IR estimated by homeostatic model assessment of IR; key secondary outcomes include changes in the Matsuda index, oral disposition index, body mass index z-score, and fat mass to fat-free mass ratio. To gain mechanistic insight, endpoints that reflect host-microbiota interactions will also be assessed: obesity-related immune, metabolic, and satiety markers; humoral metabolites; and fecal microbiota composition, short-chain fatty acids, and bile acids.

   DISCUSSION: This study will compare the potential metabolic benefits of fiber with those of metformin in adolescents with obesity, determine if metformin and fiber act synergistically to improve IR, and elucidate whether the metabolic benefits of metformin and fiber associate with changes in fecal microbiota composition and the output of health-related metabolites. This study will provide insight into the potential role of the gut microbiome as a target for enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of emerging treatments for T2DM prevention.

Abstract
  WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) may confer a range of benefits for people with type 2 diabetes (T2D), which is reflected through their position within diabetes treatment guidelines. The objective of this narrative review is to explore the efficacy data of once-weekly (QW) GLP-1 RAs in terms of glycaemic control, body weight reduction, cardiovascular (CV) outcomes and potential renal protective effects to assist pharmacists and other healthcare professionals (HCPs) in treatment discussions with patients.

   METHODS: This a narrative review focused on 31 clinical trials involving the Phase 3 clinical programmes of the QW GLP-1 RAs dulaglutide, exenatide extended-release (ER) and semaglutide subcutaneous (s.c.).

   RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The clinical trials were divided by their comparator arms and examined for trends. All QW GLP-1 RAs were superior to placebo for reductions in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c ) and body weight. Data regarding QW GLP-1 RAs versus metformin were limited, likely due to metformin's use as the first-line pharmacologic for T2D. In the robust head-to-head trials of QW versus QW GLP-1 RAs, semaglutide s.c. was superior to both dulaglutide and exenatide ER regarding HbA1c and body weight; however, QW versus once-daily GLP-1 RA trials had mixed results depending on the comparators. Finally, in QW GLP-1 RA versus insulin trials, all QW GLP-1 RAs were as effective as insulin, particularly when hypoglycaemia and body weight were also considered. CV outcome trials demonstrated benefits in major adverse CV events and renal outcomes for semaglutide and dulaglutide.

   WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: This review collates recently published data and previously published Phase 3 results to allow pharmacists and other HCPs to understand all of the efficacy data available and the corresponding impact on treatment guidelines. QW GLP-1 RAs are emerging as important therapeutic options for people with T2D as they offer a spectrum of benefits extending beyond glycaemic control, but it is important to be aware of their efficacy differences when prescribing and discussing them with patients.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: There is limited information regarding the optimal third-line therapy for managing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) that is inadequately controlled using dual combination therapy. This study assessed the efficacy and safety of pioglitazone or glimepiride when added to metformin plus alogliptin treatment for T2DM.

   METHODS: This multicenter, randomized, active-controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02426294) recruited 135 Korean patients with T2DM that was inadequately controlled using metformin plus alogliptin. The patients were then randomized to also receive pioglitazone (15 mg/day) or glimepiride (2 mg/day) for a 26-week period, with dose titration was permitted based on the investigator's judgement.

   RESULTS: Glycosylated hemoglobin levels exhibited similar significant decreases in both groups during the treatment period (pioglitazone: -0.81%, P<0.001; glimepiride: -1.05%, P<0.001). However, the pioglitazone-treated group exhibited significantly higher high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (P<0.001) and significantly lower homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance values (P<0.001). Relative to pioglitazone, adding glimepiride to metformin plus alogliptin markedly increased the risk of hypoglycemia (pioglitazone: 1/69 cases [1.45%], glimepiride: 14/66 cases [21.21%]; P<0.001).

   CONCLUSION: Among patients with T2DM inadequately controlled using metformin plus alogliptin, the addition of pioglitazone provided comparable glycemic control and various benefits (improvements in lipid profiles, insulin resistance, and hypoglycemia risk) relative to the addition of glimepiride.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: In treatment options for type 2 diabetes in adolescents and youth (TODAY), 4.5% of obese youth clinically diagnosed with type 2 diabetes (T2D) had genetic variants consistent with maturity onset diabetes of youth (MODY) diagnosis. The course of IS and beta-cell function in obese youth with MODY remains unknown. In this secondary analysis, we examined IS and beta-cell function in MODY vs. non-MODY obese youth at randomization and over time.

   METHODS: Genetic data in TODAY included 426 non-MODY (T2D) and 22 MODY youth (7 glucokinase MODY mutation positive [GCK-MODY], 12 hepatocyte nuclear factor MODY mutation positive [HNF-MODY], 2 Insulin gene mutation [insulin (INS)-MODY], and 1 Kruppel-like factor 11 [KLF11-MODY]). Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)-derived IS, C-peptide index, and beta-cell function relative to IS oral disposition index (oDI) was measured at randomization, and over 24 months in addition to total and high-molecular-weight adiponectin (HMWA).

   RESULTS: At randomization, IS, total adiponectin, and HMWA were significantly higher in the two MODY groups than in non-MODY. beta-cell function measured by C-peptide oDI was 3-fold higher in GCK-MODY than in HNF-MODY and 1.5-fold higher than non-MODY (P for both <.05). Glycemic failure rate was 75.0% in HNF-MODY, 46.9% in non-MODY, and zero in GCK-MODY youth. While the changes in IS and oDI were not different among the three groups in the first 6 months, IS improved from 6 to 24 months in HNF-MODY vs GCK-MODY youth.

   CONCLUSIONS: In TODAY, beta-cell function at randomization was worse in obese HNF-MODY youth compared with GCK-MODY youth, while insulin sensitivity was worse in non-MODY compared with the other two MODY groups. Over time, IS showed the greatest improvement in HNF-MODY youth. This raises the possibility that TODAY therapeutic modalities of insulin sensitization in these obese HNF-MODY youth may have played a beneficial role. Copyright © 2020 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) drugs reduce gastric acid secretion and lead to an increase in serum gastrin levels. Many preclinical and some clinical researches have established some positive effects of gastrin or PPI therapy on glucose regulation. The aim of this study was to prospectively investigate the short term effects of esomeprazole on glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In addition, the presence of an association between this effect and gastrin levels was evaluated.

   METHODS: Thirty-two subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus were enrolled and grouped as intervention (n=16) and control (n=16). The participants in the intervention group were prescribed 40 mg of esomeprazole treatment for three months. At the beginning of the study and at the 3rd month, HbA1c level (%) and gastrin levels (pmol/L) of participants were assessed. Then, the groups were compared in terms of their baseline and 3rd month values.

   RESULTS: In the intervention group, the mean gastrin level increased significantly from 34.3+/-14.4 pmol/L to 87.4+/-43.6 pmol/L (p<0.001). The mean HbA1c level was similar to the pre-treatment level (6.3+/-0.7% vs. 6.4+/-0.9%, p=0.441). There were no statistically significant differences in all parameters of the control group. The majority of individuals were on metformin monotherapy (65.6 %). The subgroup analysis of metformin monotherapy revealed that, in intervention group, there was a significant increase in gastrin levels (39.9+/-12.6 vs. 95.5+/-52.5, p=0.026), but the HbA1c levels did not change (6.0+/-0.4 % vs. 5.9+/-0.6 %, p=0.288); and in control group, gastrin levels did not change (37.5 +/- 26.7 vs. 36.1 +/-23.3, p=0.367), but there was an increase in HbA1c levels (6.1 +/- 0.50 vs. 6.4 +/- 0.60, p=0.01).

   CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that esomeprazole has no extra benefit for the controlled diabetic patient in three months. However, in only the metformin-treated subgroup, esomeprazole may prevent the rise in HbA1c level. Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.

Abstract
  AIMS: To investigate the association between fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) levels and glycemic response to exenatide in patients with type 2 diabetes.

   METHODS: The exploratory analysis of a multi-center trial included 190 patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled by monotherapy or combination therapy of metformin and insulin secretagogues. All participants received exenatide twice daily as an add-on therapy for 16 weeks. Serum FGF21 and other information at the baseline and end of follow-ups were obtained. Linear regression analysis was used to determine the correlations between baseline FGF21 levels and HbA1c reduction from baseline after the treatment.

   RESULTS: After 16 weeks of treatment with exenatide, a decline in the HbA1c levels from baseline was associated with higher baseline FGF21 levels among all participants (r = 0.193, P = 0.008) and in subgroup of the participants receiving background metformin monotherapy (r = 0.231, P = 0.034). Compared with patients in the lowest FGF21 quartile, patients in the highest FGF21 quartile showed a significantly weakened decline in HbA1c levels from baseline among all participants (beta = - 0.16 [95% Cl - 0.31 to - 0.01], P < 0.05) and in subgroup of the participants receiving background metformin monotherapy (beta = - 0.23 [95% Cl - 0.43 to - 0.03], P < 0.05), after adjusting for the confounding factors, including age, sex, and baseline HbA1c levels.

   CONCLUSIONS: The high baseline FGF21 levels are associated with poor glycemic responses to exenatide in patients with type 2 diabetes. Therefore, FGF21 could be used as a biomarker for predicting the efficacy of exenatide treatment.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: This study was conducted to compare glycaemic control with insulin detemir administered according to two titration algorithms (3-0-3 and 2-4-6-8) after 20 weeks of treatment in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus inadequately controlled on metformin.

   METHODS: This was a 20-week, randomised, multicentre, open-labelled, treat-to-target trial. Forty-six patients were randomised in a 1:1 manner to either the 3-0-3 (G3, n=23) or 2-4-6-8 (G2, n=23) algorithm. The primary endpoint was change of haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and the secondary safety endpoint included hypoglycaemic events.

   RESULTS: After 20 weeks, HbA1c decreased similarly in the G3 and G2 groups, with a mean change of -0.9% from baseline. The mean change in fasting plasma glucose was numerically similar in both groups. The hypoglycaemia event rate per 100-patient-years of exposure (r) in the G2 group (r=1,427) was higher than that in the G3 group (r=807).

   CONCLUSION: Both treatment groups had numerically similar HbA1c reductions. A trend towards fewer hypoglycaemia episodes after dose stabilisation was seen with the simpler G3. Clinically, this may be an important observation, as a simpler titration algorithm may support self-management and maintenance of insulin therapy. Copyright © 2020 Korean Endocrine Society.

Abstract
  CLINICAL QUESTION: What are the benefits and harms of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists when added to usual care (lifestyle interventions and/or other diabetes drugs) in adults with type 2 diabetes at different risk for cardiovascular and kidney outcomes?

   CURRENT PRACTICE: Clinical decisions about treatment of type 2 diabetes have been led by glycaemic control for decades. SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists are traditionally used in people with elevated glucose level after metformin treatment. This has changed through trials demonstrating atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) benefits independent of medications' glucose-lowering potential.

   RECOMMENDATIONS: The guideline panel issued risk-stratified recommendations concerning the use of SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists in adults with type 2 diabetes* Three or fewer cardiovascular risk factors without established CVD or CKD: Weak recommendation against starting SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists.* More than three cardiovascular risk factors without established CVD or CKD: Weak recommendation for starting SGLT-2 inhibitors and weak against starting GLP-1 receptor agonists.* Established CVD or CKD: Weak recommendation for starting SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists.* Established CVD and CKD: Strong recommendation for starting SGLT-2 inhibitors and weak recommendation for starting GLP-1 receptor agonists.* For those committed to further reducing their risk for CVD and CKD outcomes: Weak recommendation for starting SGLT-2 inhibitors rather than GLP-1 receptor agonists.

   HOW THIS GUIDELINE WAS CREATED: An international panel including patients, clinicians, and methodologists created these recommendations following standards for trustworthy guidelines and using the GRADE approach. The panel applied an individual patient perspective.

   THE EVIDENCE: A linked systematic review and network meta-analysis (764 randomised trials included 421 346 participants) of benefits and harms found that SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists generally reduce overall death, and incidence of myocardial infarctions, and end-stage kidney disease or kidney failure (moderate to high certainty evidence). These medications exert different effects on stroke, hospitalisations for heart failure, and key adverse events in different subgroups. Absolute effects of benefit varied widely based on patients' individual risk (for example, from five fewer deaths in the lowest risk to 48 fewer deaths in the highest risk, for 1000 patients treated over five years). A prognosis review identified 14 eligible risk prediction models, one of which (RECODe) informed most baseline risk estimates in evidence summaries to underpin the risk-stratified recommendations. Concerning patients' values and preferences, the recommendations were supported by evidence from a systematic review of published literature, a patient focus group study, a practical issues summary, and a guideline panel survey.

   UNDERSTANDING THE RECOMMENDATION: We stratified the recommendations by the levels of risk for CVD and CKD and systematically considered the balance of benefits, harms, other considerations, and practical issues for each risk group. The strong recommendation for SGLT-2 inhibitors in patients with CVD and CKD reflects what the panel considered to be a clear benefit. For all other adults with type 2 diabetes, the weak recommendations reflect what the panel considered to be a finer balance between benefits, harms, and burdens of treatment options. Clinicians using the guideline can identify their patient's individual risk for cardiovascular and kidney outcomes using credible risk calculators such as RECODe. Interactive evidence summaries and decision aids may support well informed treatment choices, including shared decision making. Copyright Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

Abstract
  Understanding the exact role of current drugs in Covid-19 disease is essential in the era of global pandemics. Metformin which prescribed as the first-line treatment of type 2 diabetes has beneficial effects on Sars-cov2 infection. These effects are including regulation of immune system, Renin-Angiotensin System and Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4 function in Covid-19 infection. It also activates ACE2, the main receptor of Sars-cov2, in the epithelial cells of respiratory tissue through AMPK signaling and subsequently decreases the rate of viral adhesion. Metformin also declines the adherence of Sars-cov2 to DPP4 (the other receptor of the virus) on T cells. Hence, regulatory effects of metformin on membranous ACE2, and DPP4 can modulate immune reaction against Sars-cov2. Also, immunometabolic effects of metformin on inflammatory cells impair hyper-reactive immune response against the virus through reduction of glycolysis and propagation of mitochondrial oxidation. Metformin also decreases platelet aggravation and risk of thrombosis. In this article, we argue that metformin has beneficial effects on Covid-19 infection in patients with type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance. This opinion should be investigated in future clinical trials.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) has shown evidence of cardiovascular benefit in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Currently metformin is the guideline-recommended first-line treatment. We aimed to investigate the benefit of SGLT2i vs metformin as first-line therapy.

   METHODS: Electronic medical records from Chang Gung Research Database during 2016-2019 were retrieved for patients with T2DM. Patients aged < 20, not receiving anti-diabetic medication, first-line treatment neither metformin nor SGLT2i were excluded. Primary outcomes were heart failure hospitalization, acute coronary syndrome, ischemic stroke, and all-cause mortality. Patients were followed up for events or December 31, 2019, whichever comes first.

   RESULTS: After exclusion criteria, a total of 41,020 patients with T2DM were eligible for analysis. There were 1100 patients with SGLT2i as first-line and 39,920 patients with metformin as first-line treatment. IPTW was used for propensity score matching. During one year follow-up, the hazard ratio (HR) of patients on SGLT2i as first-line treatment to patients on metformin as first-line treatment were HR 0.47 (95% CI 0.41-0.54, p < 0.0001) in heart failure hospitalization, HR 0.50 (95% CI 0.41-0.61, p < 0.0001) in acute coronary syndrome, HR 1.21 (95% CI 1.10-1.32, p < 0.0001) in ischemic stroke, and HR 0.49 (95% CI 0.44-0.55, p < 0.0001) in all-cause mortality.

   CONCLUSIONS: In patients with T2DM, SGLT2i as first-line treatment may be associated with decreased events of heart failure hospitalization, acute coronary syndrome, and all-cause mortality, compared with metformin as first-line treatment. However, there may be an increased events of ischemic stroke using SGLT2i compared to metformin.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: There are significant differences in costs and effectiveness among the second-line treatment options for type 2 diabetes (T2DM). We aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the second-line anti-diabetic therapy in T2DM patients inadequately controlled on metformin (MET) in Taiwan from the perspective of the National Health Insurance (NHI).

   METHODS: The Cardiff T2DM model was used to predict the occurrence of mortality, diabetes-related complications, and drug adverse events. Five second-line treatments were selected for the analysis: sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2-i), glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1-RA), dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (DPP-4-i), sulfonylurea (SU), and insulin (INS). Treatment efficacy data were obtained from meta-analyses and randomized clinical trials, whereas cost data were derived from the NHI databases.

   RESULTS: The analysis found that SU + MET (DPP-4-i as triple therapy) had the lowest cost, and SU + MET (SGLT-2-i as triple therapy) was associated with a mean incremental benefit of 0.47 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) at an incremental cost of NT$2769, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of NT$5840/QALY. Compared to their next less costly strategies, SGLT-2-i + MET (SU as triple therapy) and SGLT-2-i + MET (DPP-4-i as triple therapy) had ICER values of NT$63,170/QALY and NT$64,090/QALY, respectively. These results were fairly robust to extensive sensitivity analyses, but were relatively sensitive to baseline HbA1c, HbA1c threshold, and utilities.

   CONCLUSION: The addition of either SU or SGLT-2-i to MET was found to be cost-effective, using the 2019 forecast for GDP per capita of Taiwan (NT$770,770) as the willingness to pay (WTP) threshold.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: The influence of different hypoglycemic agents on peri-implant variables among type 2 diabetes mellitus patients is still unclear. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the radiographic marginal bone loss and clinical parameters around implants in patients using different hypoglycemic agents.

   METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, the dental implant records of type 2 diabetes mellitus patients who met the inclusion criteria were collected. The patients using only single medication as follows: insulin, metformin, or glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) drugs, were grouped according to their medication. These patients received implant placement with the same initial status, and all the prosthesis restorations were cement-retained ceramic crowns. The peri-implant marginal bone levels were evaluated by periapical radiographs immediately after implant placement and at 1 and 2-year follow-up visits. The baseline characteristics were compared among groups. The peri-implant radiographic marginal bone loss and clinical parameters were preliminarily compared using the Kruskal-Wallis test, and then the covariates were controlled by covariance analysis. Bonferroni post hoc adjustment test was performed for the multiple comparisons.

   RESULTS: After a review of more than 7000 medical records, a total of 150 patients with 308 implants at 1-year follow-up were assessed. The peri-implant marginal bone loss in the GLP-1 drug group was significantly smaller than the insulin group and metformin group (P < 0.01). The radiographic bone loss in the metformin group was higher than the insulin group (P < 0.05). Some of these included patients were lost to follow-up. Only 74 patients with 129 implants completed the 2-year follow-up. The radiographic bone loss in the metformin group was still higher than the insulin group (P < 0.05) and GLP-1 group (P < 0.01). There was no significant difference in the BOP (+) and the mean PD among groups (P > 0.05).

   CONCLUSIONS: The radiographic variables were not exactly the same among the patients with different hypoglycemic agents at both the 1 and 2-year follow-ups. After ensuring consistency in baseline characteristics, the positive effect of GLP-1 drugs on peri-implant bone remodeling may be no less than insulin or metformin. More studies are needed to verify the direct effect of these drugs on peri-implant bone. Clinical trial registration number ChiCTR2000034211 (retrospectively registered).

Abstract
  AIMS: Data on the effect of liraglutide on glycemic endpoints in people with T2DM using multiple daily insulin injections (MDI) are scarce, especially in the context of ethnicity.

   METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of the placebo-controlled randomized clinical "MAGNA VICTORIA" trials in Western European (WE) and South Asian (SA) people with T2DM. Participants had inadequate glycemic control despite using metformin and/or sulfonylurea derivatives and/or insulin. Participants were assigned to liraglutide (1.8 mg) or placebo for 6 months, in addition to standard care. The primary endpoint number of participants reaching target HbA1c was compared for liraglutide versus placebo in the complete dataset and MDI-treated participants using Chi-square test. Liraglutide's efficacy in WE and SA was compared using a generalized linear model.

   RESULTS: Forty-five subjects were randomized to liraglutide and 51 to placebo. In each group, one participant did not complete the study. Liraglutide-treated patients reached target HbA1c more frequently: 23/45 (51%) vs 11/51 (22%), relative probability 2.4 (1.3-4.3), p = 0.002. Subgroup analysis in 43 MDI participants showed that the proportion reaching target HbA1c using liraglutide was significantly higher than in placebo: 9/22 (41%) vs 1/21 (5%), p = 0.005. There was no difference between WE and SA in terms of liraglutide efficacy (p = 0.18).

   CONCLUSIONS: Liraglutide treatment resulted in increased chance of reaching target HbA1c as compared to placebo. Liraglutide efficacy was sustained in participants using MDI regimens and those of SA descent. Liraglutide should be considered for T2DM people with inadequate glycemic control despite MDI.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Recent cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs) changed the therapeutic strategy of guidelines for type 2 diabetes. We compared the characteristics of patients from real-world hospital settings with those of participants in recent pragmatic randomized trials.

   METHODS: This electronic medical record (EMR)-based retrospective observational study investigated the data of patients with diabetes from inpatient and outpatient settings in West China Hospital of Sichuan University from January 1, 2011, to June 30, 2019. We identified patients meeting the inclusion criteria of a pragmatic randomized trial (EMPA-REG OUTCOME) based on EMRs and compared their baseline characteristics with those of the trial participants. The cutoff for the clinical significance of each characteristic was set as its minimal clinically important difference based on expert consultation.

   RESULTS: We included 48,257 inpatients and 36,857 outpatients with diabetes and found that 8389 (17.4%) inpatients and 2646 (7.2%) outpatients met the inclusion criteria for the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial. Compared with the trial population, the real-world inpatients meeting the eligibility criteria of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME had similar age, blood pressure, and lipid profiles but comprised of fewer males, metformin users, anti-hypertensive drug users, and aspirin users, and had a lower body mass index. The group of outpatients meeting the eligibility criteria had fewer males, similar age, fewer metformin users, fewer insulin users, fewer anti-hypertensive drug users, and fewer aspirin users compared with the trial population.

   CONCLUSIONS: The trial population in EMPA-REG OUTCOME represents only a small portion of patients with diabetes from the inpatient and outpatient departments of a Chinese tertiary medical center. Evidence localization in different clinical settings and validation are essential to enabling extrapolation of the results from CVOTs in patients with diabetes to Chinese clinical practice.

Abstract
  The present meta-analysis evaluated the efficacy and safety of empagliflozin + linagliptin combination compared with either monotherapy [n=6 randomized controlled trials; 2857 adults with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) on diet + exercise +/- metformin; 39.7% women; mean age: 54.6-59.9 years]. The combination of empagliflozin 10 mg + linagliptin 5 mg led to significantly greater reductions in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) compared with either drug alone over 24 weeks: weighted mean difference [WMD; -0.72%, 95% confidence interval (CI): -1.04, -0.40], and fasting plasma glucose (-1.60 mmol/L 95% CI: -2.21, -1.00). Similar results were observed when empagliflozin 25 mg + linagliptin 5 mg was compared with linagliptin 5 mg monotherapy or with empagliflozin 10 or 25 mg monotherapy. Patients with T2DM treated with the drug combination had more than three times higher likelihood of achieving HbA1c <7% than those on either monotherapy. Weight reduction was significantly greater in the combination group only when compared with linagliptin monotherapy. Safety profile was similar between combination treatment and monotherapies. Overall, the empagliflozin + linagliptin combination had superior efficacy and similar safety in achieving euglycaemia compared with either monotherapy. This combination, administered once daily, has the potential to reduce regimen complexity, enhance adherence and improve outcomes in clinical practice. Copyright © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Abstract
  The guidance issued to the pharmaceutical industry by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2008 has led to the publication of a series of randomized, controlled cardiovascular outcomes trials with newer therapeutic classes of glucose-lowering medications. Several of these trials, which evaluated the newer therapeutic classes of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, have reported a reduced incidence of major adverse cardiovascular and/or renal outcomes, usually relative to placebo and standard of care. Metformin was the first glucose-lowering agent reported to improve cardiovascular outcomes in the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) and thus became the foundation of standard care. However, as this clinical trial reported more than 20 years ago, differences from current standards of trial design and evaluation complicate comparison of the cardiovascular profiles of older and newer agents. Our article revisits the evidence for cardiovascular protection with metformin and reviews its effects on the kidney. Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

Abstract
  AIM: Efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin plus saxagliptin (DAPA + SAXA) were compared with insulin glargine (INS) in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) in a 52-week extension study.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: This international Phase 3 study randomized adults with T2D on metformin with/without sulphonylurea. They received DAPA + SAXA or INS for 24 weeks (short-term) with a 28-week (long-term) extension. Week 52 exploratory endpoints included adjusted mean change from baseline in glycated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and body weight, and a proportion of patients achieving optimal glycaemic response without hypoglycaemia and without requiring rescue medication.

   RESULTS: Of the 1163 patients enrolled, 643 received treatment; 600 (DAPA + SAXA, 306; INS, 294) entered the long-term phase. At 52 weeks, HbA1c [adjusted least squares (LS) mean; 95% confidence interval (CI)] decreased more with DAPA + SAXA (-1.5% [-1.6%, -1.4%]) than with INS (-1.3% [-1.4%, -1.1%]); the LS mean difference (95% CI) was -0.25% (-0.4%, -0.1%; P = 0.009). Total body weight reduced with DAPA + SAXA [LS mean (95% CI): -1.8 kg (-2.4, -1.3)] and increased with INS [LS mean (95% CI): +2.8 kg (2.2, 3.3)]. More patients on DAPA + SAXA (17.6%) achieved HbA1c <7.0% without hypoglycaemia versus those on INS (9.1%). Rescue medication was required by 77 patients (23.8%) and 97 patients (30.4%) in the DAPA + SAXA and INS groups, respectively.

   CONCLUSION: DAPA + SAXA treatment was non-inferior to INS in reducing HbA1c and body weight, and in achieving optimal glycaemic control without hypoglycaemia in patients with T2D 52 weeks after initiation.

Abstract
  AIM: To compare the effect of liraglutide or placebo added on to sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) +/- metformin on glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with type 2 diabetes on a stable SGLT2i dose +/- metformin (with HbA1c 7.0%-9.5% and body mass index [BMI] >= 20 kg/m2 ) were randomized 2:1 to add-on liraglutide 1.8 mg/day or placebo in this parallel, double-blind, multinational trial. Primary and confirmatory secondary endpoints were changes in HbA1c and body weight from baseline to week 26, respectively. The proportions of patients achieving HbA1c (<7.0%) targets and safety events after week 26 were also assessed.

   RESULTS: Of 303 patients randomized (one in error), 280 completed treatment. Mean changes in HbA1c from baseline to week 26 with liraglutide (n = 202) and placebo (n = 100) were - 0.98% and - 0.30%, respectively (estimated treatment difference [ETD]: -0.68% [95% CI: -0.89, -0.48]; P < 0.001). Mean body weight changes from baseline were - 2.81 versus -1.99 kg, respectively (ETD: -0.82 kg [95% CI: -1.73, 0.09]; P = 0.077); 51.8% of liraglutide-treated patients achieved HbA1c < 7.0% versus 23.2% receiving placebo (odds ratio: 5.1 [95% CI: 2.67, 9.87]; P < 0.001). More patients treated with liraglutide reported >=1 treatment-emergent adverse events (66.3%) versus placebo (47.0%).

   CONCLUSIONS: Liraglutide significantly improved glycaemic control compared with placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes, insufficiently controlled with SGLT2is with/without metformin, with no unexpected safety findings.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between metformin use and anemia risk in type 2 diabetes, and the time-course for this, in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) and real-world population data.

   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Anemia was defined as a hemoglobin measure of <11 g/dL. In the RCTs A Diabetes Outcome Progression Trial (ADOPT; n = 3,967) and UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS; n = 1,473), logistic regression was used to model anemia risk and nonlinear mixed models for change in hematological parameters. In the observational Genetics of Diabetes Audit and Research in Tayside Scotland (GoDARTS) population (n = 3,485), discrete-time failure analysis was used to model the effect of cumulative metformin exposure on anemia risk.

   RESULTS: In ADOPT, compared with sulfonylureas, the odds ratio (OR) (95% CI) for anemia was 1.93 (1.10, 3.38) for metformin and 4.18 (2.50, 7.00) for thiazolidinediones. In UKPDS, compared with diet, the OR (95% CI) was 3.40 (1.98, 5.83) for metformin, 0.96 (0.57, 1.62) for sulfonylureas, and 1.08 (0.62, 1.87) for insulin. In ADOPT, hemoglobin and hematocrit dropped after metformin initiation by 6 months, with no further decrease after 3 years. In UKPDS, hemoglobin fell by 3 years in the metformin group compared with other treatments. At years 6 and 9, hemoglobin was reduced in all treatment groups, with no greater difference seen in the metformin group. In GoDARTS, each 1 g/day of metformin use was associated with a 2% higher annual risk of anemia.

   CONCLUSIONS: Metformin use is associated with early risk of anemia in individuals with type 2 diabetes, a finding consistent across two RCTs and replicated in one real-world study. The mechanism for this early fall in hemoglobin is uncertain, but given the time course, is unlikely to be due to vitamin B12 deficiency alone. Copyright © 2020 by the American Diabetes Association.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: In patients with type 2 diabetes uncontrolled with metformin, exenatide once weekly (QW) plus dapagliflozin produced greater reductions in glycemic parameters (glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c], fasting plasma glucose [FPG], and 2-h postprandial glucose [2-h PPG]), weight, and systolic blood pressure (SBP) than exenatide QW or dapagliflozin alone after 28 weeks of treatment in DURATION-8. Following a 24-week extension period, improvements were sustained at 52 weeks. In this study, we investigated efficacy and safety at 104 weeks after randomization.

   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: DURATION-8 was a 104-week, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, active-controlled, phase 3 trial. In total, 695 adults (aged >=18 years) with type 2 diabetes and inadequate glycemic control (HbA1c 8.0-12.0% [64-108 mmol/mol]) despite stable metformin monotherapy (>=1,500 mg/day) were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive exenatide 2 mg QW plus once-daily dapagliflozin 10 mg, exenatide QW plus placebo, or dapagliflozin plus placebo. All 104-week evaluations were exploratory.

   RESULTS: At week 104, 431 (62.0%) patients completed treatment. The adjusted least squares mean change (SE) from baseline to week 104 in HbA1c was greater with exenatide QW plus dapagliflozin (-1.70% [0.11]) versus exenatide QW plus placebo (-1.29% [0.12]; P = 0.007) and dapagliflozin plus placebo (-1.06% [0.12]; P < 0.001). Clinically relevant changes in FPG, 2-h PPG, weight, and SBP were also observed with exenatide QW plus dapagliflozin. There were no unexpected safety findings, and exenatide QW plus dapagliflozin was well tolerated, with no episodes of major hypoglycemia.

   CONCLUSIONS: In this exploratory analysis, among those individuals who completed the trial without rescue therapy, there was clinically relevant efficacy over 2 years with exenatide QW plus dapagliflozin, with no unexpected safety findings. Copyright © 2020 by the American Diabetes Association.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of ultra rapid lispro (URLi) versus lispro in patients with type 2 diabetes on a basal-bolus insulin regimen.

   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a phase 3, treat-to-target, double-blind 26-week study. After an 8-week lead-in to optimize basal insulin glargine or degludec in combination with prandial lispro treatment, patients were randomized to blinded URLi (n = 336) or lispro (n = 337) injected 0-2 min prior to meals. Patients could continue metformin and/or a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor. The primary end point was change in HbA1c from baseline to 26 weeks (noninferiority margin 0.4%), with multiplicity-adjusted objectives for postprandial glucose (PPG) excursions during a standardized meal test.

   RESULTS: HbA1c improved for both URLi and lispro, and noninferiority was confirmed: estimated treatment difference (ETD) 0.06% (95% CI -0.05; 0.16). Mean change in HbA1c was -0.38% for URLi and -0.43% for lispro, with an end-of-treatment HbA1c of 6.92% and 6.86%, respectively. URLi was superior to lispro in controlling 1- and 2-h PPG excursions: 1-h ETD, -0.66 mmol/L (95% CI -1.01, -0.30); 2-h ETD, -0.96 mmol/L (-1.41, -0.52). Significantly lower PPG excursions were evident from 0.5 to 4.0 h postmeal with URLi treatment. There were no significant treatment differences in rates of severe or documented hypoglycemia (<3.0 mmol/L). Incidence of overall treatment-emergent adverse events was similar between treatments.

   CONCLUSIONS: URLi compared with lispro in a basal-bolus regimen was confirmed to be noninferior for HbA1c and superior to lispro for PPG control in patients with type 2 diabetes. Copyright © 2020 by the American Diabetes Association.

  Background: Due to several limitations in the study designs of sulfonylurea pharmacogenomics studies, we investigated the clinical and genetic predictors of secondary sulfonylurea failure in Type 2 diabetes patients. Materials & methods: Patients receiving the maximum sulfonylurea and metformin doses for >1 year were enrolled. Secondary sulfonylurea failure was defined as HbA1c >7.0% (>53 mmol/mol) after a 12-month follow-up. Results: By multivariate analysis, increased insulin resistance (HOMA2-IR), baseline HbA1c >7.0%, residing in eastern Peninsular Malaysia, and the CC genotype of rs757110 ABCC8 gene polymorphism were independent predictors of secondary sulfonylurea failure (p < 0.05) while sulfonylurea-induced hypoglycemia was protective against such failure (p < 0.05). Conclusion:  Sulfonylurea does not benefit patients with an increased risk of secondary sulfonylurea failure.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of mortality in type 2 diabetes (T2D). Better interventions are needed to mitigate the high lifetime risk for CVD in youth T2D.

   OBJECTIVE: To compare 30-year risk for CVD events in 2 cohorts of adolescents with T2D and severe obesity undergoing medical or surgical treatment of T2D.

   SETTING: Longitudinal multicenter studies at University hospitals.

   METHODS: A secondary analysis of data collected from the participants with T2D enrolled in the Teen-Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery (Teen-LABS, n = 30) and participants of similar age and racial distribution from the Treatment Options of Type 2 Diabetes in Adolescents and Youth (TODAY, n = 63) studies was performed. Teen-LABS participants underwent metabolic bariatric surgery (MBS). TODAY participants were randomized to metformin alone or in combination with rosiglitazone or intensive lifestyle intervention, with insulin therapy given for glycemic progression. A 30-year CVD event score developed by the Framingham Heart Study was the primary outcome, assessed at baseline (preoperatively for Teen-LABS), 1 year, and 5 years of follow-up.

   RESULTS: Participants with T2D from Teen-LABS (n = 30; mean +/- SD age = 16.9 +/- 1.3 yr; 70% female; 60% white; body mass index (BMI) = 54.4 +/- 9.5 kg/m2) and TODAY (n = 63; 15.3 +/- 1.3 yr; 56% female; 71% white; BMI 40.5 +/- 4.9 kg/m2) were compared. The likelihood of CVD events was higher in Teen-LABS versus TODAY at baseline (17.66 [1.59] versus 12.11 [.79]%, adjusted P = .002). One year after MBS, event risk was significantly lower in Teen-LABS versus TODAY (6.79 [1.33] versus 13.64 [0.96]%, adjusted P < .0001), and sustained at 5 years follow-up (adjusted P < .0001).

   CONCLUSION: Despite higher pretreatment risk for CVD events, treatment with MBS resulted in a reduction in estimated CVD event risks, whereas medical therapy associated with an increase in risk among adolescents with T2D and severe obesity.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: This systematic review describes the efficacy, safety, and drug interactions of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs), and sodium-glucose transport protein 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs).

   DATA SOURCES: Articles were identified by English-language MEDLINE search, published prior to May 2020, using the terms kidney transplant, OR PTDM, OR NODAT, AND metformin, OR DPP4, OR GLP1, OR SGLT2.

   STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: All selected studies were included if the study population was composed of adult KTRs who were diagnosed with either impaired glucose tolerance, diabetes mellitus (DM), new-onset diabetes after transplant (NODAT), or posttransplantation diabetes mellitus (PTDM).

   DATA SYNTHESIS: In KTRs, there is evidence for safety with DPP-4 inhibitors, GLP-1 RAs, and SGLT2 inhibitors. However, urinary tract infections and a slight initial decrease in renal function may limit use of SGLT2 inhibitors. As compared with the nontransplant type 2 DM population, SGLT2 inhibitors are not as efficacious in KTRs.

   RELEVANCE TO PATIENT CARE AND CLINICAL PRACTICE: This review provides an overview of the current literature on newer antidiabetic agents, addressing efficacy, safety, and drug interactions to help guide clinical decision-making for their use in KTRs.

   CONCLUSION: Newer antidiabetic agents have been recommended by the American Diabetes Association for potential cardiovascular, renal, and hypoglycemic benefits. Particular agents, such as DPP-4 inhibitors and GLP-1 RAs may play a role in correcting PTDM-related defects. Clinicians need to take into account both patient-specific and drug-specific characteristics when initiating these agents in KTRs.

Abstract
  PURPOSE: There are roughly 30 million Americans diagnosed with diabetes mellitus (DM), with nearly 95% of these cases being type 2 (T2)-DM. The American Diabetes Association continues to recommend metformin as the first-line initial treatment of T2DM, in combination with lifestyle modifications; yet, many require multiple therapies to achieve adequate glycemic control. In patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure, or chronic kidney disease, adding a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist is a preferred treatment option; however, many patients are apprehensive about injecting medications. Semaglutide is the first oral option in this life-saving medication class. The purpose of this article was to review the pharmacology, clinical trials, safety profile, along with recommended dosing and costs, of oral semaglutide used for managing patients with T2DM.

   METHODS: A search through the PubMed, MEDLINE and Cochrane libraries was conducted for literature published from January 2017 through December 2020, using the key word semaglutide. Articles were selected if they were related to the approval of oral semaglutide or provided novel clinical information regarding this drug entity in its oral dosage formulation.

   FINDINGS: Three Phase II studies of the pharmacokinetic properties and Phase III trials from the PIONEER series were ultimately selected, as these trials were thought to provide pivotal information to the US Food and Drug Administration for the approval of oral semaglutide.

   IMPLICATIONS: On review of the literature, it appeared that semaglutide is a viable option in treating T2DM. The use of this medication has been associated with glycosylated hemoglobin lowering similar to that with the injectable medication in its same class. Semaglutide was also showed some potential in preventing cardiovascular events as well as increasing weight loss. Copyright Published by Elsevier Inc.

Abstract
  Background: To evaluate whether metformin use assuredly alters overall all-cause death in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and chronic kidney disease (CKD).

   Methods: Pubmed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were systematically searched from inception to Feb. 29, 2020 with no language restriction. All related articles comparing all-cause death of T2DM and CKD patients after metformin use (monotherapy or combination) versus non-metformin treatment were identified. Pooled risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were computed using random-effects models regardless of the heterogeneity quantified by Cochrane chi2 and I2 statistics.

   Results: Totally 13 studies (9 cohort studies [CSs], 3 subanalyses or post-hoc analyses of randomized controlled trials [RCTs], and 1 nested case-control article) involving 303,540 patients were included. Metformin-based treatments relative to any other measure displayed significantly lower risks of all-cause mortality (Pooled RRs 0.71, 95%CI 0.61 to 0.84; I2 = 79.0%) and cardiovascular events (Pooled RRs 0.76, 95%CI 0.60 to 0.97; I2 = 87.0%) in CKD patients at stage G1-3, with substantial heterogeneity. Metformin use was not significantly related with these end points in advanced CKD patients.

   Conclusions: Metformin use is connected with significantly less risks of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events in patients with T2DM and mild/moderate CKD. However, RCTs with large sample sizes are warranted in the future to assess whether these key benefits extend to later stages of CKD by dose adjustment.

Abstract
  Background: As growing evidence links gut microbiota with the therapeutic efficacy and side effects of anti-hyperglycemic drugs, this article aims to provide a systematic review of the reciprocal interactions between anti-hyperglycemic drugs and gut microbiota taxa, which underlie the effect of the gut microbiome on diabetic control via bug-host interactions. Method: We followed the PRISMA requirements to perform a systematic review on human vs. animal gut microbiota data in PubMed, SCOPUS, and EMBASE databases, and used Cochrane, ROBIN-I, and SYRCLE tools to assess potential bias risks. The outcomes of assessment were trends on gut microbiota taxa, diversity, and associations with metabolic control (e.g., glucose, lipid) following anti-hyperglycemic treatment. Results: Of 2,804 citations, 64 studies (17/humans; 47/mice) were included. In human studies, seven were randomized trials using metformin or acarbose in obese, pre-diabetes, and type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients. Treatment of pre-diabetes and newly diagnosed T2D patients with metformin or acarbose was associated with decreases in genus of Bacteroides, accompanied by increases in both Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus. Additionally, T2D patients receiving metformin showed increases in various taxa of the order Enterobacteriales and the species Akkermansia muciniphila. Of seven studies with significant differences in beta-diversity, the incremental specific taxa were associated with the improvement of glucose and lipid profiles. In mice, the effects of metformin on A. muciniphila were similar, but an inverse association with Bacteroides was reported. Animal studies on other anti-hyperglycemic drugs, however, showed substantial variations in results. Conclusions: The changes in specific taxa and beta-diversity of gut microbiota were associated with metformin and acarbose in humans while pertinent information for other anti-hyperglycemic drugs could only be obtained in rodent studies. Further human studies on anti-hyperglycemic drugs other than metformin and acarbose are needed to explore gut microbiota's role in their therapeutic efficacies and side effects.

Abstract
  Gestational diabetes mellitus is a condition similar to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in that patients are unable to compensate for the degree of insulin resistance, and both conditions are often treated with metformin. The comparative pharmacodynamic response to metformin in these 2 populations has not been studied. This study characterized insulin sensitivity, beta-cell responsivity, and disposition index following a mixed-meal tolerance test utilizing a minimal model of glucose, insulin, and C-peptide kinetics before and during treatment with metformin. The study included women with gestational diabetes mellitus (n = 34), T2DM (n = 14), and healthy pregnant women (n = 30). Before treatment, the gestational diabetes mellitus group had significantly higher baseline (45%), dynamic (68%), static (71%), and total beta-cell responsivity (71%) than the T2DM group. Metformin significantly increased insulin sensitivity (51%) as well as disposition index (97%) and decreased mixed-meal tolerance test peak glucose concentrations (8%) in women with gestational diabetes mellitus after adjustment for gestational age-dependent effects; however, in women with T2DM metformin only significantly affected peak glucose concentrations (22%) and had no significant effect on any other parameters. Metformin had a greater effect on the change in disposition index (DELTA disposition index) in women with gestational diabetes mellitus than in those with T2DM (P = .01). In conclusion, response to metformin in women with gestational diabetes mellitus is significantly different from that in women with T2DM, which is likely related to the differences in disease severity.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Regional differences in the profile and treatment strategies of patients with cardiometabolic diseases have been studied in several different countries. The Cardio-Vascular and metabolic treatments in Canada: Assessment of REal-life therapeutic value (CV-CARE) registry was designed to evaluate patient profiles and medical management of cardiometabolic diseases in routine clinical care settings across Canada. Primary objectives were to (1) evaluate regional variability of patient profiles with cardiometabolic disease(s) and (2) assess treatment differences of patients treated for type 2 diabetes (T2D), hypercholesterolemia (HCh), and hypertension (HTN) across Canada.

   METHODS: CV-CARE is a multi-center, observational, prospective registry that enrolled Canadian patients treated with metformin-extended release (MetER) for T2D, colesevelam (C) for HCh, azilsartan (AZI) for mild-to-moderate essential HTN and azilsartan/chlorthalidone (AZI/CHL) for severe, essential HTN. Patient characteristics and treatments were assessed at baseline.

   RESULTS: The registry enrolled 6960 patients, with a total of 4194 patients making up the primary analysis population [MetER (n=995); C (n=1639); AZI (n=1364); AZI/CHL (n=498)]. First-line use of MetER was more common in British Columbia (BC; 45.5%) compared to Ontario (ON; 29.8%), and Quebec (QC; 12.9%). C treatment for HCh was used as monotherapy most readily in BC (68.7%) compared with QC (59.7%) and ON (35.8%). Dual action of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and hemoglobin A1c reduction was the predominant reason for C add-on therapy (46.8%), with highest usage seen in ON (62.9%). AZI treatment for HTN was most frequently used in BC (43.8%), and AZI/CHL was most commonly used in ON (12.0%). First-line use of AZI was more common in QC (50%) vs. ON (34.9%) and BC (24.1%). The primary reason for switching to AZI and AZI/CHL from prior treatment was lack of efficacy across provinces.

   CONCLUSION: This is the first regional description of the CV-CARE cohort. Significant variations in both baseline profile and treatments were observed which could have an impact on long-term outcomes. Copyright © 2020 Japanese College of Cardiology.

Abstract
  Diabetes mellitus type 2 and cancer share many risk factors. The pleiotropic insulin-dependent and insulin-independent effects of metformin might inhibit pathways that are frequently amplified in neoplastic tissue. Particularly, modulation of inflammation, metabolism, and cell cycle arrest are potential therapeutic cancer targets utilized by metformin to boost the anti-cancer effects of chemotherapy. Studies in vitro and in vivo models have demonstrated the potential of metformin as a chemo- and radiosensitizer, besides its chemopreventive and direct therapeutic activity in digestive system (DS) tumors. Hence, these aspects have been considered in many cancer clinical trials. Case-control and cohort studies and associated meta-analyses have evaluated DS cancer risk and metformin usage, especially in colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Most clinical studies have demonstrated the protective role of metformin in the risk for DS cancers and survival rates. On the other hand, the ability of metformin to enhance the actions of chemotherapy for gastric and biliary cancers is yet to be investigated. This article reviews the current findings on the anti-cancer mechanisms of metformin and its apparatus from pre-clinical and ongoing studies in DS malignancies. Copyright ©The Author(s) 2021.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the benefits of dapagliflozin in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and type 2 diabetes in the Dapagliflozin And Prevention of Adverse-Outcomes in Heart Failure trial (DAPA-HF) varied by background glucose-lowering therapy (GLT).

   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We examined the effect of study treatment by the use or not of GLT and by GLT classes and combinations. The primary outcome was a composite of worsening heart failure (hospitalization or urgent visit requiring intravenous therapy) or cardiovascular death.

   RESULTS: In the 2,139 type 2 diabetes patients, the effect of dapagliflozin on the primary outcome was consistent by GLT use or no use (hazard ratio 0.72 [95% CI 0.58-0.88] vs. 0.86 [0.60-1.23]; interaction P = 0.39) and across GLT classes.

   CONCLUSIONS: In DAPA-HF, dapagliflozin improved outcomes irrespective of use or no use of GLT or by GLT type used in patients with type 2 diabetes and HFrEF. Copyright © 2020 by the American Diabetes Association.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To compare effects of the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitor linagliptin with those of a sulfonylurea on renal physiology in metformin-treated patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this double-blind randomized trial, 46 overweight T2DM patients without renal impairment received once-daily linagliptin (5 mg) or glimepiride (1 mg) for 8 weeks. Fasting glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) were determined by inulin and para-aminohippuric acid clearances. Fractional excretions, urinary damage markers, and circulating DPP-4 substrates (among others, glucagon-like peptide 1 and stromal cell-derived factor-1alpha [SDF-1alpha]) were measured.

   RESULTS: HbA1c reductions were similar with linagliptin (-0.45 +/- 0.09%) and glimepiride (-0.65 +/- 0.10%) after 8 weeks (P = 0.101). Linagliptin versus glimepiride did not affect GFR, ERPF, estimated intrarenal hemodynamics, or damage markers. Only linagliptin increased fractional excretion (FE) of sodium (FENa) and potassium, without affecting FE of lithium. Linagliptin-induced change in FENa correlated with SDF-1alpha (R = 0.660) but not with other DPP-4 substrates.

   CONCLUSIONS: Linagliptin does not affect fasting renal hemodynamics compared with glimepiride in T2DM patients. DPP-4 inhibition promotes modest natriuresis, possibly mediated by SDF-1alpha, likely distal to the macula densa. Copyright © 2020 by the American Diabetes Association.

Abstract
  The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of gemigliptin added to a stable dose of insulin alone or of insulin in combination with metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. After a two-week run-in period, patients were randomized 2:1 to receive gemigliptin 50 mg or placebo once daily as add-on to background therapy with insulin or insulin plus metformin for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was change in haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) from baseline at Week 24. Baseline characteristics were similar between the gemigliptin (n = 188) and placebo (n = 95) groups in terms of HbA1c (8.1%). At Week 24, the gemigliptin group showed a statistically significant reduction in mean HbA1c from baseline as compared with placebo (between-group mean difference, -0.7% [95% CI, -0.9% to -0.4%]; P-value < 0.0001). The incidence of overall adverse events and the number of hypoglycaemic adverse events were similar between the study groups. Gemigliptin added to insulin alone or to insulin in combination with metformin resulted in superior glycaemic control compared to that in the placebo group and was well tolerated for 24 weeks in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, without causing weight gain or increasing the incidence of hypoglycaemia.

Abstract
  AIM: To determine the effects of individual and combined therapies on plasma insulin, glucagon, beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OH) and associated metabolites.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: In DURATION-8, the combination of once-weekly exenatide (EQW) + 10 mg dapagliflozin (Dapa) in patients with type 2 diabetes poorly controlled with metformin-reduced HbA1c levels and body weight (at weeks 28 and 52) was compared with EQW + placebo (Plb) or Dapa + Plb. The study included 678 patients randomized 1:1:1 to EQW + Dapa, EQW + Plb, or Dapa + Plb. Plasma insulin and glucagon were measured at fasting and 2 hours after a mixed meal. Fasting plasma free fatty acids (FFA) and beta-OH concentrations were measured.

   RESULTS: The fasting insulin-to-glucagon molar ratio (I/Glg) increased with EQW + Plb only; postprandial I/Glg increased in all groups but significantly more with EQW + Plb. beta-OH, FFA, and glycerol concentrations showed a parallel response: larger increments with Dapa + Plb, larger decrements with EQW + Plb, and intermediate changes with EQW + Dapa. beta-OH levels and I/Glg were inversely related to one another. Patients in the top quartile of beta-OH changes from baseline [median (interquartile range): +207 (305) vs. -65 (-154) mumol/L; P < .0001] were more frequently treated with Dapa + Plb, had higher urine glucose-to-creatinine ratios, and lower fasting insulin [52 (51) vs. 68 (53) pmol/L; P = .0013) and I/Glg [1.76 (1.49) vs. 2.23 (1.70) mol/mol; P = .0020]. Haematocrit increased only in the Dapa group.

   CONCLUSIONS: The EQW + Dapa combination abolished the Dapa-induced rise in beta-OH, reduced the EQW-induced increase in I/Glg, maintained glycosuria, and increased haematocrit in patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes. The drug combination may preserve any putative benefits while mitigating the risk of ketoacidosis. Copyright © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Abstract
  AIMS: To determine the effects of the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, sitagliptin, on gastric emptying (GE) of a high-carbohydrate meal and associated glycaemic and blood pressure (BP) responses in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourteen patients with T2DM (nine men, five women; age 67.8 +/- 1.5 years; body mass index 31.2 +/- 0.9 kg/m2 ; T2DM duration: 4.2 +/- 0.9 years; glycated haemoglobin: 46 +/- 1.8 mmol/mol [6.4% +/- 0.2%]), managed by diet and/or metformin, underwent concurrent measurements of GE, BP and plasma glucose for 240 minutes after ingestion of a radiolabelled mashed potato meal after receiving sitagliptin (100 mg) or placebo in randomized, double-blind, crossover fashion on 2 consecutive days.

   RESULTS: Sitagliptin reduced postprandial plasma glucose (P < .005) without affecting GE (P = .88). The magnitude of the glucose-lowering effect (change in incremental area under the curve0-240 min from placebo to sitagliptin) was related to GE (kcal/min) on placebo (r = 0.68, P = .008) There was a comparable fall in systolic BP (P = .80) following the meal, with no difference between the 2 days.

   CONCLUSIONS: In T2DM, while sitagliptin has no effect on either GE or postprandial BP, its ability to lower postprandial glucose are dependent on the basal rate of GE. Copyright © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Abstract
  Diabetes mellitus characterized by hyperglycaemia presents an array of comorbidities such as cardiovascular and renal failure, dyslipidemia, and cognitive impairments. Populations above the age of 60 are in an urgent need of effective therapies to deal with the complications associated with diabetes mellitus. Widely used anti-diabetic drugs have good safety profiles and multiple reports indicate their pleiotropic effects in diabetic patients or models. This review has been written with the objective of identifying the widely-marketed anti-diabetic drugs which can be efficiently repurposed for the treatment of other diseases or disorders. It is an updated, comprehensive review, describing the protective role of various classes of anti-diabetic drugs in mitigating the macro and micro vascular complications of diabetes mellitus, and differentiating these drugs on the basis of their mode of action. Notably, metformin, the anti-diabetic drug most commonly explored for cancer therapy, has also exhibited some antimicrobial effects. Unlike class specific effects, few instances of drug specific effects in managing cardiovascular complications have also been reported. A major drawback is that the pleiotropic effects of anti-diabetic drugs have been mostly investigated only in diabetic patients. Thus, for effective repurposing, more clinical trials devoted to analyse the effects of anti-diabetic drugs in patients irrespective of their diabetic condition, are required.

Abstract
  AIM: To investigate the effect of normalizing vitamin B12 (B12) levels with oral B12 (methylcobalamin) 1000 mug/day for one year in patients with diabetic neuropathy (DN).

   PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 90 patients with type 2 diabetes on metformin for at least four years and both peripheral and autonomic DN were randomized to an active treatment group (n = 44) receiving B12 and a control group (n = 46) receiving a placebo. All patients had B12 levels less than 400 pmol/L. Subjects underwent measurements of sural nerve conduction velocity (SNCV), sural nerve action potential (amplitude) (SNAP), and vibration perception threshold (VPT), and they performed cardiovascular autonomic reflex tests (CARTs: mean circular resultant (MCR), Valsalva test, postural index, and orthostatic hypotension). Sudomotor function was assessed with the SUDOSCAN that measures electrochemical skin conductance in hands and feet (ESCH and ESCF, respectively). We also used the Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument Questionnaire and Examination (MNSIQ and MNSIE, respectively) and questionnaires to evaluate quality of life (QoL) and level of pain (pain score).

   RESULTS: B12 levels increased from 232.0 +/- 71.8 at baseline to 776.7 +/- 242.3 pmol/L at follow-up, p < 0.0001, in the active group but not in the control group. VPT, MNSIQ, QoL, pain score, SNCV, SNAP, and ESCF significantly improved in the active group (p < 0.001, p = 0.002, p < 0.0001, p < 0.000, p < 0.0001, p < 0.0001, and p = 0.014, respectively), whereas CARTS and MNSIE improved but not significantly. MCR, MNSIQ, SNCV, SNAP, and pain score significantly deteriorated in the control group (p = 0.025, p = 0.017, p = 0.045, p < 0.0001, and p < 0.0001, respectively).

   CONCLUSIONS: The treatment of patients with DN with 1 mg of oral methylcobalamin for twelve months increased plasma B12 levels and improved all neurophysiological parameters, sudomotor function, pain score, and QoL, but it did not improve CARTS and MNSIE.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Observational series suggest a mortality benefit from metformin in the heart failure (HF) population. However, the benefit of metformin in HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) has yet to be explored. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify whether variation in EF impacts mortality outcomes in HF patients treated with metformin.

   METHODS: MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched up to October 2019. Observational studies and randomised trials reporting mortality in HF patients and the proportion of patients with an EF > 50% at baseline were included. Other baseline variables were used to assess for heterogeneity in treatment outcomes between groups. Regression models were used to determine the interaction between metformin and subgroups on mortality.

   RESULTS: Four studies reported the proportion of patients with a preserved EF and were analysed. Metformin reduced mortality in both preserved or reduced EF after adjustment with HF therapies such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and beta-blockers (beta = - 0.2 [95% CI - 0.3 to - 0.1], p = 0.02). Significantly greater protective effects were seen with EF > 50% (p = 0.003). Metformin treatment with insulin, ACEi and beta-blocker therapy were also shown to have a reduction in mortality (insulin p = 0.002; ACEi p < 0.001; beta-blocker p = 0.017), whereas female gender was associated with worse outcomes (p < 0.001).

   CONCLUSIONS: Metformin treatment is associated with a reduction in mortality in patients with HFpEF.

Abstract
  Colorectal cancer (CRC) is among the most prevalent cancers worldwide, and its prevention and reduction of incidence is imperative. The presence of diabetes has been associated with a 30% increased risk of CRC, likely through the mechanism of hyperinsulinemia, which promotes tumorigenesis via the insulin receptor in the epithelium or by insulin-like growth factor pathways, inflammation, or adipokines, inducing cancer cell proliferation and cancer spread. Metformin, the first-line agent in treating type 2 diabetes, has a chemopreventive role in CRC development. Additionally, preclinical studies suggest synergistic effects of metformin with oxaliplatin in inhibiting in vitro models of colon cancer. Although preclinical studies on the post diagnostic use of metformin were promising and suggested its synergistic effects with chemotherapy, the data on the possible effects of metformin after surgery and other CRC treatment in the clinical setting are less conclusive, and randomized controlled trials are still lacking.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: Pharmaceutical treatment options for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have increased to include multiple classes of oral glucose-lowering agents but without accompanying guidance on which of these may most benefit individual patients. Clinicians lack information for treatment intensification after first-line metformin therapy. Stratifying patients by simple clinical characteristics may improve care by targeting treatment options to those in whom they are most effective. This academically designed and run three-way crossover trial aims to test a stratification approach using three standard oral glucose-lowering agents.

   METHODS AND ANALYSIS: TriMaster is a randomised, double-blind, crossover trial taking place at up to 25 clinical sites across England, Scotland and Wales. 520 patients with T2DM treated with either metformin alone, or metformin and a sulfonylurea who have glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) >58 mmol/mol will be randomised to receive 16 weeks each of a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor and thiazolidinedione in random order. Participants will be assessed at the end of each treatment period, providing clinical and biochemical data, and their experience of side effects. Participant preference will be assessed on completion of all three treatments. The primary endpoint is HbA1c after 4 months of therapy (allowing a range of 12-18 weeks for analysis). Secondary endpoints include participant-reported preference between the three treatments, tolerability and prevalence of side effects.

   ETHICAL APPROVAL: This study was approved by National Health Service Health Research Authority Research Ethics Committee South Central-Oxford A, study 16/SC/0147. Written informed consent will be obtained from all participants. Results will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal and presented at relevant scientific meetings. A lay summary of results will be made available to all participants.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: Metformin and diets aimed at promoting healthy body weight are the first line in treating type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Clinical practice, backed by clinical trials, suggests that many individuals do not reach glycaemic targets using this approach alone. The primary aim of the Personalised Medicine in Pre-diabetes-Towards Preventing Diabetes in Individuals at Risk (PREDICT) Study is to test the efficacy of personalised diet as adjuvant to metformin in improving glycaemic control in individuals with dysglycaemia.

   METHODS AND ANALYSIS: PREDICT is a two-arm, parallel group, single-masked randomised controlled trial in adults with pre-diabetes or early-stage T2DM (with glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) up to 8.0% (64 mmol/mol)), not treated with glucose-lowering medication. PREDICT is conducted at the Clinical Research Facility at the Garvan Institute of Medical Research (Sydney). Enrolment of participants commenced in December 2018 and expected to complete in December 2021. Participants are commenced on metformin (Extended Release, titrated to a target dose of 1500 mg/day) and randomised with equal allocation to either (1) the Personalised Nutrition Project algorithm-based diet or (2) low-fat high-dietary fibre diet, designed to provide caloric restriction (75%) in individuals with body mass index >25 kg/m2. Treatment duration is 6 months and participants visit the Clinical Research Facility five times over approximately 7 months. The primary outcome measure is HbA1c. The secondary outcomes are (1) time of interstitial glucose <7.8 mmol/L and (2) glycaemic variability (continuous glucose monitoring), (3) body weight, (4) fat mass and (5) abdominal visceral fat volume (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry), serum (6) low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (7) high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and (8) triglycerides concentrations, (9) blood pressure, and (10) liver fat (Fibroscan).

   ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has been approved by the St Vincent's Hospital Human Research Ethics Committee (File 17/080, Sydney, Australia) and the Weizmann Institutional Review Board (File 528-3, Rehovot, Israel). The findings will be published in peer-reviewed open access medical journals.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Comorbidities are prevalent among Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients. Few studies have characterized their prevalence and impact in Latin American populations.

   OBJECTIVE: We aim to assess the prevalence of comorbidities and their impact on the risk of physical disability across different MS phenotypes.

   METHODS: Cross-sectional multicenter study of patients under regular clinical care at the Programa de Esclerosis Multiple UC and Hospital Dr. Sotero del Rio in Chile. Prevalence of comorbidities was estimated from the retrospective assessment of electronic medical charts. Disease phenotypes were categorized into two groups: clinically isolated syndrome/relapsing-remitting (inflammatory group) and primary/secondary progressive MS patients (progressive group). A multivariable analysis using binary logistic regression for assessing the risk of EDSS >= 6.0 in each group was performed.

   RESULTS: A total of 453 patients was included, 71% female, mean age at onset 31 years, mean disease duration 10 years, and median EDSS 2.0 (range 0-10). In the whole sample, most prevalent comorbidities were ever-smoking (42.2%), depression/anxiety (34.9%), thyroid disease (15.7%), hypertension (11.3%) and insulin resistance/type 2 diabetes mellitus (11.0%). When assessing the risk of EDSS >= 6, in the inflammatory group (N = 366), age at onset (OR 1.06, 95%CI(1.02-1.11), p = 0.008), disease duration (OR 1.06, 95%CI(1.00-1.12), p = 0.039) and epilepsy comorbidity (OR 5.36, 95%CI(1.33-21.5), p = 0.018) were associated with a higher risk of disability. In the progressive group (N = 87), disease duration was a risk factor (OR 1.08 95%CI(1.02-1.16), p = 0.014), while shorter diagnostic delay (OR 0.91 95%CI(0.85-0.99), p = 0.025) and insulin resistance/type 2 diabetes mellitus comorbidity were protective factors (OR 0.18 95%CI(0.04-0.83), p = 0.028), 72% of these patients were receiving metformin.

   CONCLUSIONS: Comorbidities are common across different MS disease phenotypes. Epilepsy seems particularly related with a higher risk of physical disability in relapsing-remitting patients, while the role of insulin resistance/type 2 diabetes mellitus or the impact of metformin use as a protective factor should be further studied. Prospective and larger studies are still needed in order to assess the real impact of comorbidities and their management in MS outcomes. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: There is emerging evidence for stratified glucose-lowering responses to certain oral medications for type 2 diabetes (T2D) by individual characteristics. The objective of this study was to test whether glycaemic response to representative treatments of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (vildagliptin) and thiazolidinediones (pioglitazone) varies according to ethnicity, gender, baseline obesity, triglyceride level or genetic variation.

   METHODS: This is a multicentre, two-period, two-treatment, open-label, randomised cross-over trial of vildagliptin and pioglitazone as second-line or third-line therapy in patients with T2D who have suboptimal glycaemic control on metformin and/or sulfonylurea therapy. It is conducted in New Zealand with a target of 300 patients (40% with Maori or Pacific ancestry) eligible if aged >=18 and <=80 years, with T2D for more than 1 year, on stable doses of metformin and/or sulfonylurea for at least 3 months, with HbA1c between 59 and 110 mmol/mol inclusive. Participants are assigned to complete 4 months of vildagliptin 50 mg per day or pioglitazone 30 mg per day, followed by 4 months of the other medications in randomly allocated sequences. Participant characteristics, including ethnicity, obesity, lipid profile and candidate genotypes are collected at baseline. Primary outcome variable is on treatment HbA1c. Secondary outcomes include weight change, frequency of side effects and patient preference.

   ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval of the trial has been obtained from the New Zealand Health and Disability Ethics Committee (18/STH/242). The trial commenced in February 2019 and recruitment is expected to be completed by March 2020. Results will be reported in articles submitted to peer-reviewed journals, as well as in presentations at national and international meetings.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Recent randomized control trials have described a protective cardiovascular effect of novel glucose lowering drugs in patients at high cardiovascular risk. Whether these second-line agents have similar effects in the general population is unknown. We aimed to compare the risk of major cardiovascular and adverse events in new users of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i), dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (DPP-4i), glucagon-like peptide 1 agonist (GLP-1a), and sulfonylurea in T2DM patients not controlled on metformin therapy.

   METHODS: Retrospective cohort study using the MarketScan database (2011-2015). We selected T2DM individuals who were newly dispensed sulfonylureas, SGLT-2i, DPP-4i, or GLP-1a, as second-line therapy, added to metformin. Cohort entry was defined by date of first prescription of the second-line agent. Time to first non-fatal cardiovascular or adverse event was compared using Cox regression models adjusted for confounders.

   RESULTS: Among 118,341 T2DM patients using metformin (mean age: 56), most were at low cardiovascular risk (4% with previous cardiovascular or cerebrovascular event). During a median follow-up of 10 months compared with sulfonylureas users, cardiovascular risk was lower in users of SGLT-2i (aHR = 0.61; 95% CI: 0.40-0.97), DPP-4i (aHR = 0.79; 95% CI: 0.69-0.90) and GLP-1a (aHR = 0.65; 95% CI: 0.48-0.89). Serious adverse events were rare but compared with sulfonylurea, the risk was lower in new users of novel glucose lowering agents.

   CONCLUSION: In our analyses, which included patients with and without prior cardiovascular disease, initiating novel glucose lowering drugs as second-line therapy for T2DM was associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular and adverse events than sulfonylurea initiation.

Abstract
  Clozapine is associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes. Glucagon-like-peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists such as exenatide can counter clozapine-associated GLP-1 dysregulation. Our 24-week randomized, controlled, open-label, pilot trial of once-weekly extended-release subcutaneous exenatide or usual care (CODEX) (n = 28), found exenatide was associated with significantly greater weight loss. We examined whether this effect was maintained at 12-months post-intervention. We followed up CODEX trial participants at 12-months post trial endpoint, collecting information on weight, BMI, waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting glucose, HbA1c, and use of metformin. The primary outcome of interest was change in weight from trial baseline to 12-months post endpoint and trial endpoint to 12-months post endpoint compared between former exenatide and usual care participants. Only HbA1c differed between baseline and 12-months post endpoint between the exenatide and control groups. From endpoint to 12-month follow up there were significantly greater increases among the former exenatide versus former usual care participants for weight, BMI, HbA1c and proportion with >5% weight gain. Stratifying results by whether participants used metformin post trial did not alter proportion with >5% weight gain. Although there were no significant differences in weight and BMI between baseline and 12-month post endpoint, there were significant increases in weight and BMI in the 12 months post endpoint for the former exenatide group. This was irrespective of metformin use and is in keeping with studies of other GLP-1RA agents. Further studies on GLP-1RAs use beyond 24 weeks for people with clozapine associated weight gain are needed. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of an alternative approach to type 2 diabetes prevention. Ninety-six patients with prediabetes (age 52 (10) years; 80% female; BMI 39.2 (7.1) kg/m2) received a continuous remote care intervention focused on reducing hyperglycemia through carbohydrate restricted nutrition therapy for two years in a single arm, prospective, longitudinal pilot study. Two-year retention was 75% (72 of 96 participants). Fifty-one percent of participants (49 of 96) met carbohydrate restriction goals as assessed by blood beta-hydroxybutyrate concentrations for more than one-third of reported measurements. Estimated cumulative incidence of normoglycemia (HbA1c <5.7% without medication) and type 2 diabetes (HbA1c >=6.5% or <6.5% with medication other than metformin) at two years were 52.3% and 3%, respectively. Prevalence of metabolic syndrome, class II or greater obesity, and suspected hepatic steatosis significantly decreased at two years. These results demonstrate the potential utility of an alternate approach to type 2 diabetes prevention, carbohydrate restricted nutrition therapy delivered through a continuous remote care model, for normalization of glycemia and improvement in related comorbidities.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVES: Cost-effectiveness estimates are useful to a health plan when they are specific to a utilization management policy question. To help inform a step therapy policy decision, this study assessed the 3-year cost-effectiveness of adding a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor versus switching to a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) in patients with type 2 diabetes who are on metformin and a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor from both private and public payer perspectives in the United States.

   STUDY DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis.

   METHODS: A decision-analytic model was built incorporating goal glycated hemoglobin (A1C) achievement as the effectiveness measure, as well as adverse effect and discontinuation rates from clinical trial data. One-way, scenario, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed.

   RESULTS: In a cohort of 1000 patients, adding an SGLT2 inhibitor led to $3.9 million more in spending and 93 more patients reaching goal A1C compared with switching from a DPP-4 inhibitor to a GLP-1 RA. This resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $42,125 per patient to achieve goal A1C from the private payer perspective. Using a public payer perspective led to an ICER of $103,829. These results were most sensitive to changes in drug costs and the proportion of patients achieving A1C goal or discontinuing.

   CONCLUSIONS: Assuming a $50,000 willingness-to-pay threshold, adding an SGLT2 inhibitor was cost-effective compared with switching from a DPP-4 inhibitor to a GLP-1 RA from a private payer perspective but not from a public payer perspective. This study highlights how differences in payer reimbursement rates for medications can lead to contrasting results.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: To our knowledge, no meta-analyses or reviews have investigated the efficacy and safety of metformin on cardiovascular outcomes after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We thus conduct a high-quality systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the efficacy and safety of metformin on cardiovascular outcomes after AMI in patients with T2DM.

   METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we will search PUBMED, Scopus, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases through April, 2021. The study is structured to adhere to PRISMA guidelines (i.e., Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses). The literature search, data extraction, and quality assessments are conducted independently by 2 authors. Outcome measures include all-cause mortality; complications such as acute kidney injury, lactic acidosis, hospitalization for AMI or stroke, or death. Where disagreement in the collection of data occurs, this is resolved through discussion. Review Manager Software (v 5.3; Cochrane Collaboration) is used for the meta-analysis. Two independent reviewers will assess the risk of bias of the included studies at study level.

   RESULTS: It is hypothesized that metformin use at the post-AMI is associated with decreased risk of cardiovascular disease and death in patients with T2DM.

   CONCLUSIONS: This study expects to provide credible and scientific evidence for the efficacy and safety of metformin on cardiovascular outcomes after AMI in patients with T2DM.

Abstract
  Metformin is the safest and the most widely prescribed first-line therapy for managing hyperglycemia due to different underlying causes, primarily type 2 diabetes mellitus. In addition to its euglycemic properties, metformin has stimulated a wave of clinical trials to investigate benefits on aging-related diseases and longevity. Such an impact on the lifespan extension would undoubtedly expand the therapeutic utility of metformin regardless of glycemic status. However, there is a scarcity of studies evaluating whether metformin has differential cognitive effects across age, sex, glycemic status, metformin dose, and duration of metformin treatment and associated pathological conditions. By scrutinizing the available literature on animal and human studies for metformin and brain function, we expect to shed light on the potential impact of metformin on cognition across age, sex, and pathological conditions. This review aims to provide readers with a broader insight of (a) how metformin differentially affects cognition and (b) why there is a need for more translational and clinical studies examining multifactorial interactions. The outcomes of such comprehensive studies will streamline precision medicine practices, avoiding "fit for all" approach, and optimizing metformin use for longevity benefit irrespective of hyperglycemia.

Abstract
  AIMS: Type 2 diabetes is considered to be one of the essential risks of adverse outcomes in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). 1 Metformin and insulin were suggested to affect the outcomes. However, divergent views are still expressed. We aim to gain further insight into metformin and insulin in both pre-admission and in-hospital usage in COVID-19 patients with pre-existed type 2 diabetes.

   MAIN METHODS: This is a multicentral retrospective study of the hospital confirmed COVID-19 patients between January 19 to April 09, 2020, who admitted to 3 main hospitals in Xiangyang city, China. The effect of type 2 diabetes, metformin, and insulin on COVID-19 were analyzed, respectively. Clinical characteristics, blood laboratory indices, clinical observational indices, and outcomes of these cases were collected.

   KEY FINDINGS: A total of 407 confirmed COVID-19 patients (including 50 pre-existed type 2 diabetes) were eligible in our study. COVID-19 patients with type 2 diabetes had more adverse outcomes than non-diabetes (OR2: mortality: 1.46 [95% CI3 1.11, 1.93]; P < 0.001). Pre-admission metformin usage showed a declined intensive care unit admission rate in a dose-dependent fashion (OR 0.04 [95% CI 0.00, 0.99]; adjust P = 0.049). While in-hospital insulin usage attempted to increase the invasive ventilation (8 [34.8%] vs. 1 [3.7%], adjust P = 0.043), independent of age and blood glucose.

   SIGNIFICANCE: Our study indicated that pre-admitted metformin usage may have beneficial effects on COVID-19 with pre-existed type 2 diabetes, insulin should be used sparingly in the hospital stay. Copyright © 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  AIM: To evaluate the risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, acute myocardial infarction, and stroke associated with insulin treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes.

   METHODS: A systematic review with meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) was performed. EMBASE, Cochrane, and PubMed databases were searched for RCTs reporting mortality or cardiovascular events and comparing basal insulin to any treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes. Data were summarized with Mantel-Haenzel relative risk (RR). Trial sequential analysis (TSA) was used to evaluate the reliability of the results considering a 20% relative risk difference between treatments. PROSPERO Registry: CRD42018087336.

   RESULTS: In total, 2351 references were identified, and 26 studies (24348 patients) were included. Most studies evaluated glargine insulin (69%), compared insulin to GLP-1 analogs (57%), and evaluated add-on therapy with metformin (77%). Insulin was not associated with increased all-cause mortality (RR 0.99; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.92-1.06), cardiovascular mortality (RR 1.01; 95% CI 0.91-1.13), myocardial infarction (RR 1.02; 95% CI 0.92-1.15), or stroke (RR 0.87; 95% CI 0.68-1.12). Insulin treatment increased severe hypoglycemia risk (RR 2.98; 95% CI 2.47-3.61). All analyses had low statistical heterogeneity. TSA confirmed these findings: optimal sample size (myocardial infarction), futility boundary (all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and stroke) and harm boundary (hypoglycemia) were reached.

   CONCLUSION: Treatment with basal insulin of patients with type 2 diabetes does not increase the risk of cardiovascular events or death. Despite the increased risk of hypoglycemia, these findings reinforce that insulin is a safe option in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  Impaired mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy) and NLRP3 inflammasome activation have been incriminated in the pathogenesis of T2DM. Metformin besides being an insulin sensitizer also induces autophagy; however, its effect on mitophagy and NLRP3 activation in patients with T2DM still remains elusive. Forty-five drug-naive T2DM patients with HbA1C 7%-9% (53-75 mmol/mol) were randomly assigned to receive either metformin, voglibose, or placebo for 3 months, and were also recommended for lifestyle intervention programme (n = 15 each). Mitochondrial oxidative stress (MOS) parameters, qPCR and immunoblotting of mitophagy-related markers (PINK1, PARKIN, MFN2, NIX, LC3-II, LAMP2), p-AMPKalpha (T172), and NLRP3 proteins, as well as transmission electron microscopy (TEM) for assessing mitochondrial morphology were performed in the mononuclear cells of study patients. Both metformin and voglibose showed a similar efficacy towards the reduction in HbA1c and MOS indices. However, multivariate ANCOVA divulged that mRNA and protein expression of mitophagy markers, NLRP3 and p-AMPKalpha (T172), were significantly increased only with metformin therapy. Moreover, PINK1 expression displayed a significant positive association with HOMA-beta indices, and TEM studies further confirmed reduced distortions in mitochondrial morphology in the metformin group only. Our observations underscore that metformin upregulates mitophagy and subsequently ameliorates the altered mitochondrial morphology and function, independent of its glucose-lowering effect. Further, restoration of normal mitochondrial phenotype may improve cellular function, including beta-cells, which may prevent further worsening of hyperglycaemia in patients with T2DM.

Abstract
  AIMS: To determine the association between metformin use and mortality and ARDS incidence in patients with COVID-19 and type 2 diabetes.

   METHODS: This study was a multi-center retrospective analysis of COVID-19 patients with type 2 diabetes and admitted to four hospitals in Hubei province, China from December 31st, 2019 to March 31st, 2020. Patients were divided into two groups according to their exposure to metformin during hospitalization. The outcomes of interest were 30-day all-cause mortality and incidence of ARDS. We used mixed-effect Cox model and random effect logistic regression to evaluate the associations of metformin use with outcomes, adjusted for baseline characteristics.

   RESULTS: Of 328 patients with COVID-19 and type 2 diabetes included in the study cohort, 30.5% (100/328) were in the metformin group. In the mixed-effected model, metformin use was associated with the lower incidence of ARDS. There was no significant association between metformin use and 30-day all-cause mortality. Propensity score-matched analysis confirmed the results. In the subgroup analysis, metformin use was associated with the lower incidence of ARDS in females.

   CONCLUSIONS: Metformin may have potential benefits in reducing the incidence of ARDS in patients with COVID-19 and type 2 diabetes. However, this benefit differs significantly by gender. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: Up to half of all women diagnosed with gestational diabetes mellitus develop type 2 diabetes within 5 years after delivery. Metformin is effective in preventing type 2 diabetes in high-risk non-pregnant individuals, but its effect when commenced in the postnatal period is not known. We plan to assess the feasibility of evaluating metformin versus placebo in minimising the risk of dysglycaemia including type 2 diabetes after delivery in postnatal women with a history of gestational diabetes through a randomised trial.

   METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Optimising health outcomes with Metformin to prevent diAbetes After pregnancy (OMAhA) is a multicentre placebo-controlled double-blind randomised feasibility trial, where we will randomly allocate 160 postnatal women with gestational diabetes treated with medication to either metformin (intervention) or placebo (control) tablets to be taken until 1 year after delivery. The primary outcomes are rates of recruitment, randomisation, adherence and attrition. The secondary outcomes are maternal dysglycaemia, cost and quality of life outcomes in both arms, and acceptability of the study and intervention, which will be evaluated through a nested qualitative study. Feasibility outcomes will be summarised using descriptive statistics, point estimates and 95% CIs.

   ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The OMAhA study received ethics approval from the London-Brent Research Ethics Committee (18/LO/0505). Trial findings will be published in a peer-reviewed journal, disseminated at conferences, through our Patient and Public Involvement advisory group (Katie's Team) and through social media platforms.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Clomiphene citrate (CC) has been shown to restore the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis by increasing testosterone (T) levels to physiological levels in patients with dysmetabolic conditions such as obesity, metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, the data are unclear regarding the effects on Sertoli cell (SC) function.

   AIM: To study SC function by assessing Inhibin B (IB) and anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) levels at baseline and after 3 months of CC treatment.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is an ancillary study of a cross-over, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial performed to evaluate androgen response to CC treatment in dysmetabolic obese subjects with low T levels treated with metformin. We evaluated SC function by assessing IB and AMH levels at baseline and after 3 months of each treatment in ten dysmetabolic obese subjects with low T levels. In all subjects, the influence of the clinical characteristics, metabolic and hormonal baseline parameters on SC and Leydig (LC) function, evaluated respectively with AMH, IB, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and T levels, was tested.

   RESULTS: No significant changes were observed for IB and AMH concentrations after each treatment period. Whereas T and oestradiol (E2) levels were shown to be significantly higher in the CC plus metformin phase (CC/Met) only. No clinical, metabolic or hormonal parameters showed significant effects on serum AMH at baseline or after treatments. However, baseline T, dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and E2 positively affected IB levels during CC/Met therapy (P = .003, P = .038 and P = .049, respectively). Baseline leptin and FSH had a negative (P = 031) and positive (P = .048) respectively role on T levels during CC/Met, as they were statistically significant compared to the placebo period (Plac/Met).

   CONCLUSION: Unlike the LC activity, CC was unable to influence SC function, as shown by the lack of IB and AMH serum modifications, thus suggesting an intrinsic nonreversible defect of SC cells in patients with dysmetabolic conditions. Copyright © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Abstract
  Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) improve hard renal outcomes in type 2 diabetes. This is possibly explained by the fact that SGLT2i normalize the measured glomerular filtration rate (mGFR) by increasing renal vascular resistance, as was shown in young people with type 1 diabetes and glomerular hyperfiltration. Therefore, we compared the renal hemodynamic effects of dapagliflozin with gliclazide in type 2 diabetes. The mGFR and effective renal plasma flow were assessed using inulin and para-aminohippurate clearances in the fasted state, during clamped euglycemia (5 mmol/L) and during clamped hyperglycemia (15 mmol/L). Filtration fraction and renal vascular resistance were calculated. Additionally, factors known to modulate renal hemodynamics were measured. In 44 people with type 2 diabetes on metformin monotherapy (Hemoglobin A1c 7.4%, mGFR 113 mL/min), dapagliflozin versus gliclazide reduced mGFR by 5, 10, and 12 mL/min in the consecutive phases while both agents similarly improved Hemoglobin A1c (-0.48% vs -0.65%). Dapagliflozin also reduced filtration fraction without increasing renal vascular resistance, and increased urinary adenosine and prostaglandin concentrations. Gliclazide did not consistently alter renal hemodynamic parameters. Thus, beyond glucose control, SGLT2i reduce mGFR and filtration fraction in type 2 diabetes. The fact that renal vascular resistance was not increased by dapagliflozin suggests that this is due to post-glomerular vasodilation rather than pre-glomerular vasoconstriction.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Metformin has antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects and several cohort studies have shown that metformin lower mortality in the COVID population in a majority white population. There is no data documenting the effect of metformin taken as an outpatient on COVID-19 related hospitalizations. Our aim was to evaluate if metformin decreases hospitalization and severe COVID-19 among minority Medicare patients who acquired the SARS-CoV2 virus.

   METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study including elderly minority Medicare COVID-19 patients across eight states. We collected data from the inpatient and outpatient electronic health records, demographic data, as well as clinical and echocardiographic data. We classified those using metformin as those patients who had a pharmacy claim for metformin and non-metformin users as those who were diabetics and did not use metformin as well as non-diabetic patients. Our primary outcome was hospitalization. Our secondary outcomes were mortality and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

   RESULTS: We identified 1139 COVID-19 positive patients of whom 392 were metformin users. Metformin users had a higher comorbidity score than non-metformin users (p < 0.01). The adjusted relative hazard (RH) of those hospitalized for metformin users was 0.71; 95% CI 0.52-0.86. The RH of death for metformin users was 0.34; 95% CI 0.19-0.59. The RH of ARDS for metformin users was 0.32; 95% CI 0.22-0.45. Metformin users on 1000 mg daily had lower mortality, but similar hospitalization and ARDS rates when compared to those on 500-850 mg of metformin daily.

   CONCLUSIONS: Metformin is associated with lower hospitalization, mortality and ARDS among a minority COVID-19 population. Future randomized trials should confirm this finding and evaluate for a causative effect of the drug preventing disease. Copyright © 2021 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To explore the glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue liraglutide in the hospital setting in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and acute coronary syndrome and to evaluate the safety and efficacy and its impact on hospitalization and short-term glycemic variability (GV).

   METHODS: A 12-week, open-label, prospective, randomized pilot clinical study with parallel groups that compared liraglutide (group 1) with glargine (group 2) and its impact on glycemic control and GV.

   RESULTS: Thirteen patients were included. During hospitalization, mean glucose was 164.75 mg/dL (standard deviation [SD] 19.94) in group 1 and 166.69 mg/dL (38.22) in group 2. GV determined by CV and SD was 20.98 (7.68) vs. 25.48 (7.19) and 34.37 (13.05) vs. 43.56 (19.53) in groups 1 and 2, respectively. Group 1 prandial insulin requirements during hospitalization were lower compared with group 2. Follow-up A1c in group 1 was 6.9% (-1.51%) and 6.5% in group 2 (-1.27). GV after discharge and hypoglycemia were lower in group 1 compared with group 2.

   CONCLUSIONS: Liraglutide seems to reduce GV in the acute phase of acute coronary syndrome, and patients achieved optimal control with a low incidence of hypoglycemia. These results support the need to explore liraglutide in a larger multicenter trial. Trial registration: The study was approved by the National Medical Ethics Committee of Spain. The study was registered at European Clinical Trials Database (EudraCT): 2014003298-40.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) demonstrated good glycemic efficacy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) recent years, whereas studies on GLP-1 RAs' biliary effects were limited. Therefore, we aimed to assess the effect of exenatide on bile acids (BAs) and investigate the role of BAs in the glycemic control effect of exenatide.

   METHODS: Thirty-eight newly diagnosed T2DM participants without glucose-lowering drugs intake were recruited. Plasma total bile acids in fasting state (FTBAs) and other parameters were tested at baseline. Then exenatide were applied to the T2DM participants for 12 weeks. FTBAs and glycemic parameters were measured again after exenatide treatment, and correlation analysis between changes of FTBAs and glycemic parameters were conducted to investigate the role of BAs in the glycemic control effect of exenatide.

   RESULTS: The baseline FTBAs level of T2DM patients had no significance (3.84 +/- 2.06 vs. 3.87 +/- 2.89, P = 0.954) compared with healthy subjects. After 12-week exenatide treatment for the T2DM patients, FTBAs were decreased from 3.84 +/- 2.06 mumol/L to 3.06 +/- 1.27 mumol/L (P < 0.01). The correlation analysis showed that changes of FTBAs was positively correlated with changes of FPG (r = 0.355, P < 0.05).

   CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated a decreased FTBAs level after exenatide treatment for 12 weeks, without the interference of metformin and other glucose-lowering drugs. The reduction of FTBAs might not exert a positive role in the glycemic control effect of exenatide.

Abstract
  Evidence on the beneficial effects of resveratrol supplementation on cardiovascular disease-related profiles in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) is conflicting, while its impact on renal function and blood pressure measurements remains to be established in these patients. The current meta-analysis included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reporting on the impact of resveratrol supplementation on markers of renal function and blood pressure in patients with T2D on hypoglycemic medication. Electronic databases such as MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and EMBASE were searched for eligible studies from inception up to June 2020. The random and fixed effects model was used in the meta-analysis. A total of five RCTs met the inclusion criteria and involved 388 participants with T2D. Notably, most of the participants were on metformin therapy, or metformin in combination with other hypoglycemic drugs such as insulin and glibenclamide. Pooled estimates showed that resveratrol supplementation in patients with T2D lowered the levels of fasting glucose (SMD: -0.06 [95% CI: -0.24, 0.12]; I2 = 4%, p = 0.39) and insulin (SMD: -0.08 [95% CI: -0.50, 0.34], I2 = 73%, p = 0.002) when compared to those on placebo. In addition, supplementation significantly lowered systolic blood pressure (SMD: -5.77 [95% CI: -8.61, -2.93], I2 = 66%, p = 0.02) in these patients. Although resveratrol supplementation did not affect creatinine or urea levels, it reduced the total protein content (SMD: -0.19 [95% CI: -0.36, -0.02]; I2 = 91%, p = 0.001). In all, resveratrol supplementation in hypoglycemic therapy improves glucose control and lowers blood pressure; however, additional evidence is necessary to confirm its effect on renal function in patients with T2D.

Abstract
  AIM: Aim of the present network meta-analysis (NMA) is the comparison across glucose-lowering drugs (GLA) concerning their effects on glucose control, body weight, hypoglycemia, gastrointestinal adverse events, and quality of life.

   DATA SYNTHESIS: This NMA includes randomized clinical trials comparing different head-to-head comparison trials with EMA-approved GLA in type 2 diabetes, with a duration of >=52 weeks. All drugs have to be administered at the maximal approved dose. Primary endpoints were HbA1c at 12, 52, and 104+ weeks. Secondary endpoints were body weight, quality of life, hypoglycemia, and gastrointestinal disorders. Indirect comparisons of different GLA were performed by NMA choosing metformin as reference. The standardized difference in means (SDM) and Mantel-Haenzel Odds Ratio [MH-OR] (using random-effect models) with 95% Confidence Intervals were calculated for categorical and continuous variables, respectively. We included 68 trials fulfilling all inclusion criteria. At 12 weeks, when considering indirect comparisons, insulin secretagogues (IS) were associated with a significantly greater reduction in comparison with metformin (SDM, -0.3 [-0.4;-0.2]%); a significantly lower efficacy was observed for pioglitazone. At 52 weeks, IS were no longer associated with a greater reduction of HbA1c; whereas a significant decrease in HbA1c was observed for GLP-1 RA (SDM, -0.2 [-0.1;-0.3]%). At 104+ weeks, only SGLT-2 inhibitors showed a significantly greater HbA1c reduction (SDM, -0.2 [-0.1;-0.3]%), whereas sulfonylureas and insulin showed a significantly lower efficacy (SDM, 0.1 [0.0; 0.2]%), and 0.4 [0.3; 0.5]%, respectively).

   CONCLUSIONS: The results of this meta-analysis should be considered together with evidence on long-term outcomes for selecting the most appropriate drugs for individual patients.

Abstract
  Metformin, an oral biguanide used for first-line treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, has attracted attention for its anti-proliferative and anti-cancer effects in several solid tumors, including prostate cancer (PCa). Liver kinase B1 (LKB1) and adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation, inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activity and protein synthesis, induction of apoptosis and autophagy by p53 and p21, and decreased blood insulin level have been suggested as direct anti-cancer mechanisms of metformin. Research has shown that PCa development and progression are associated with metabolic syndrome and its components. Therefore, reduction in the risk of PCa and improvement in survival in metformin users may be the results of the direct anti-cancer mechanisms of the drug or the secondary effects from improvement of metabolic syndrome. In contrast, some research has suggested that there is no association between metformin use and PCa incidence or survival. In this comprehensive review, we summarize updated evidence on the relationship between metformin use and oncological effects in patients with PCa. We also highlight ongoing clinical trials evaluating metformin as an adjuvant therapy in novel drug combinations in various disease settings.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Caloric restriction is an effective way to treat Type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, chronic and severe restriction of food intake is difficult to sustain and is known to promote slower metabolism. Intermittent and frequent fasting can exert similar metabolic effects, but may be even more challenging for most patients. A fasting-mimicking diet (FMD) is low in calories, sugars and proteins, but includes relatively high levels of plant based complex carbohydrates and healthy fats. The metabolic effects of such a diet mimic the benefits of water-only fasting. The effects of a FMD applied periodically in T2D patients are still unknown. The Fasting In diabetes Treatment (FIT) trial was designed to determine the effect of intermittent use (5 consecutive days a month during a year) of a FMD in T2D patients on metabolic parameters and T2D medication use compared to usual care.

   METHODS: One hundred T2D patients from general practices in the Netherlands with a BMI >= 27 kg/m2, treated with lifestyle advice only or lifestyle advice plus metformin, will be randomised to receive the FMD plus usual care or usual care only. Primary outcomes are HbA1c and T2D medication dosage. Secondary outcomes are anthropometrics, blood pressure, plasma lipid profiles, quality of life, treatment satisfaction, metabolomics, microbiome composition, MRI data including cardiac function, fat distribution and ectopic fat storage, cost-effectiveness, and feasibility in clinical practice.

   DISCUSSION: This study will establish whether monthly 5-day cycles of a FMD during a year improve metabolic parameters and/or reduce the need for medication in T2D. Furthermore, additional health benefits and the feasibility in clinical practice will be measured and a cost-effectiveness evaluation will be performed.

   TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov. Identifier: NCT03811587. Registered 21th of January, 2019; retrospectively registered.

Abstract
  AIMS: To investigate the effect of hypoglycaemia on platelet and coagulation activation in people with type 2 diabetes.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: This monocentric, open, single-arm, mechanistic trial included 14 people with established type 2 diabetes (four women, 10 men, age 55 +/- 7 years, glycated haemoglobin concentration 51 +/- 7 mmol/mol) receiving metformin monotherapy. A stepwise hyperinsulinaemic-hypoglycaemic clamp experiment (3.5 and 2.5 mmol/L, for 30 minutes respectively) was performed, aiming to investigate platelet and coagulation activity during predefined plateaus of hypoglycaemia, as well as 1 day and 7 days later.

   RESULTS: While platelet activation assessed by light transmittance aggregometry did not significantly increase after the hypoglycaemic clamp procedure, the more sensitive flow cytometry-based measurement of platelet surface activation markers showed hypoglycaemia-induced activation 24 hours (PAC1pos CD62Ppos , PAC1pos CD63Ppos and PAC1pos CD62Ppos CD63pos ; P < .01) and 7 days after the hypoglycaemic clamp (P < .001 for PAC1pos CD63pos ; P < .01 for PAC1pos CD62Ppos and PAC1pos CD62Ppos CD63pos ) in comparison to baseline. Coagulation markers, such as fibrinogen, D-dimer, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, von Willebrand factor activity and factor VIII, were also significantly increased, an effect that was most pronounced 24 hours after the hypoglycaemic clamp.

   CONCLUSION: A single event of insulin-induced hypoglycaemia led to an increase in markers of platelet activation and coagulation in people with early stages of type 2 diabetes on metformin therapy. However, the activation occurred with a delay and was evident 24 hours and 7 days after the actual hypoglycaemic episode. Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Abstract
  AIM: To investigate the effectiveness of metformin in delaying or preventing progression to diabetes in a Chinese population with impaired glucose regulation (IGR).

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: This multicentre, randomized, open-label, controlled study (NCT03441750) will assess the efficacy of metformin in preventing diabetes over >=2 years. Eligible participants will be randomly assigned (1:1) to lifestyle intervention (LSI) or metformin plus LSI, with stratification based on blood pressure, anti-hypertensive medication use and isolated/non-isolated impaired fasting glucose. All participants will receive LSI advice. Participants in the metformin plus LSI group will receive metformin 850 mg once daily for the first 2 weeks, and twice daily thereafter, according to tolerability.

   RESULTS: The primary objective is to compare rates of newly diagnosed diabetes in the two intervention groups. Changes in glycaemia, blood pressure, body weight, insulin resistance, and safety outcomes will also be evaluated.

   CONCLUSIONS: This large clinical trial in a Chinese population with IGR aims to provide critical information to guide clinical decision-making in order to alleviate the current diabetes epidemic. Copyright © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Abstract
  AIMS: The aim of this study was to compare the effect of gemigliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, and dapagliflozin, a sodium glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor, on glycaemic variability in type 2 diabetes patients.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this randomized, blinded end point, multicentre clinical trial, we enrolled 71 patients with type 2 diabetes who were inadequately controlled with metformin alone or were drug naive. The participants were randomized to receive gemigliptin 50 mg (n = 35) or dapagliflozin 10 mg (n = 36) daily for 12 weeks. Glycaemic variability was estimated by mean amplitude of glycaemic excursions (MAGE), standard deviation (SD) and coefficient of variation (CV) using a 6-day continuous glucose monitoring system. The primary efficacy endpoint was change in MAGE after 12 weeks compared to baseline.

   RESULTS: Intergroup differences in baseline characteristics were not significant. The adjusted mean change (+/- standard error) in MAGE after 12 weeks in the gemigliptin and dapagliflozin groups was -27.2 +/- 4.4 mg/dL and -7.9 +/- 4.9 mg/dL, respectively. Between-group comparisons showed a significantly larger reduction in MAGE in the gemigliptin group (-19.2 mg/dL; 95% CI, -31.3 to -7.2; P = .002). Measures of SD and CV also showed a significantly larger reduction in the gemigliptin group. Average glycaemic control, estimated by HbA1c, fasting glucose and safety profiles, was comparable between the two groups.

   CONCLUSIONS: Compared to dapagliflozin, gemigliptin significantly improved glycaemic variability, with similar glucose-lowering efficacy and safety profiles in patients with type 2 diabetes who were inadequately controlled with metformin alone or were drug naive.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: EXSCEL (Exenatide Study of Cardiovascular Event Lowering) assessed the impact of once-weekly exenatide 2 mg versus placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, while aiming for glycemic equipoise. Consequently, greater drop-in of open-label glucose-lowering medications occurred in the placebo group. Accordingly, we explored the potential effects of their unbalanced use on major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), defined as cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction or nonfatal stroke, and all-cause mortality (ACM), given that some of these agents are cardioprotective.

   METHODS: Cox hazard models were performed by randomized treatment for drug classes where >5% open-label drop-in glucose-lowering medication occurred, and for glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs; 3.0%) using three methodologies: drop-in visit right censoring, inverse probability for treatment weighting (IPTW), and applying drug class risk reductions.

   RESULTS: Baseline glucose-lowering medications for the 14 752 EXSCEL participants (73.1% with previous cardiovascular disease) did not differ between treatment groups. During median 3.2 years follow-up, open-label drop-in occurred in 33.4% of participants, more frequently with placebo than exenatide (38.1% versus 28.8%), with metformin (6.1% versus 4.9%), sulfonylurea (8.7% versus 6.9%), dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (10.6% versus 7.5%), SGLT-2i (10.3% versus 8.1%), GLP-1 RA (3.4% versus 2.4%), and insulin (13.8% versus 9.4%). The MACE effect size was not altered meaningfully by right censoring, but the favorable HR for exenatide became nominally significant in the sulfonylurea and any glucose-lowering medication groups, while the ACM HR and p-values were essentially unchanged. IPTW decreased the MACE HR from 0.91 (P=0.061) to 0.85 (P=0.008) and the ACM HR from 0.86 (P=0.016) to 0.81 (P=0.012). Application of literature-derived risk reductions showed no meaningful changes in MACE or ACM HRs or P values, although simulations of substantially greater use of drop-in cardioprotective glucose-lowering agents demonstrated blunting of signal detection.

   CONCLUSIONS: EXSCEL-observed HRs for MACE and ACM remained robust after right censoring or application of literature-derived risk reductions, but the exenatide versus placebo MACE effect size and statistical significance were increased by IPTW. Effects of open-label drop-in cardioprotective medications need to be considered carefully when designing, conducting, and analyzing cardiovascular outcome trials of glucose-lowering agents under the premise of glycemic equipoise.

Abstract
  AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Intra-abdominal or visceral obesity is associated with insulin resistance and an increased risk for cardiovascular disease. This study aimed to compare the effects of semaglutide 1.0 mg and canagliflozin 300 mg on body composition in a subset of participants from the SUSTAIN 8 Phase IIIB, randomised double-blind trial who underwent whole-body dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scanning.

   METHODS: Adults (age >=18 years) with type 2 diabetes, HbA1c 53-91 mmol/mol (7.0-10.5%), on a stable daily dose of metformin (>=1500 mg or maximum tolerated dose) and with an eGFR >=60 ml min-1 [1.73 m]-2 were randomised 1:1 to semaglutide 1.0 mg once weekly and canagliflozin placebo once daily, or canagliflozin 300 mg once daily and semaglutide placebo once weekly. Body composition was assessed using whole-body DXA scans. The study participants and investigator remained blinded throughout the trial, and quality of DXA scans was evaluated in a blinded manner. Change from baseline to week 52 in total fat mass (kg) was the confirmatory efficacy endpoint.

   RESULTS: A subset of 178 participants (semaglutide, n = 88; canagliflozin, n = 90) underwent DXA scanning at screening and were randomised into the substudy. Of these, 114 (semaglutide, n = 53; canagliflozin, n = 61) participants had observed end-of-treatment data included in the confirmatory efficacy analysis. Of the 178 participants in the substudy, numerical improvements in body composition (including fat mass, lean mass and visceral fat mass) were observed after 52 weeks with both treatments. Total fat mass (baseline 33.2 kg) was reduced by 3.4 kg and 2.6 kg with semaglutide and canagliflozin, respectively (estimated treatment difference: -0.79 [95% CI -2.10, 0.51]). Although total lean mass (baseline 51.3 kg) was also reduced by 2.3 kg and 1.5 kg with semaglutide and canagliflozin, respectively (estimated treatment difference: -0.78 [-1.61, 0.04]), the proportion of lean mass (baseline 59.4%) increased by 1.2%- and 1.1%-point, respectively (estimated treatment difference 0.14 [-0.89, 1.17]). Changes in visceral fat mass and overall changes in body composition (assessed by the fat to lean mass ratio) were comparable between the two treatment groups.

   CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In individuals with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes on stable-dose metformin therapy, the changes in body composition with semaglutide and canagliflozin were not significantly different. Although numerical improvements in body composition were observed following treatment in both treatment arms, the specific impact of both treatments on body composition in the absence of a placebo arm is speculative at this stage.

Abstract
  The incretin hormones glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) are released from enteroendocrine cells in response to the presence of nutrients in the small intestines. These homones facilitate glucose regulation by stimulating insulin secretion in a glucose dependent manner while suppressing glucagon secretion. In patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM), an impaired insulin response to GLP-1 and GIP contributes to hyperglycemia. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors block the breakdown of GLP-1 and GIP to increase levels of the active hormones. In clinical trials, DPP-4 inhibitors have a modest impact on glycemic control. They are generally well-tolerated, weight neutral and do not increase the risk of hypoglycemia. GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) are peptide derivatives of either exendin-4 or human GLP-1 designed to resist the activity of DPP-4 and therefore, have a prolonged half-life. In clinical trials, they have demonstrated superior efficacy to many oral antihyperglycemic drugs, improved weight loss and a low risk of hypoglycemia. However, GI adverse events, particularly nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are seen. Both DPP-4 inhibitors and GLP-1 RAs have demonstrated safety in robust cardiovascular outcome trials, while several GLP-1 RAs have been shown to significantly reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in persons with T2DM with pre-existing cardiovascular disease (CVD). Several clinical trials have directly compared the efficacy and safety of DPP-4 inhibitors and GLP-1 RAs. These studies have generally demonstrated that the GLP-1 RA provided superior glycemic control and weight loss relative to the DPP-4 inhibitor. Both treatments were associated with a low and comparable incidence of hypoglycemia, but treatment with GLP-1 RAs were invariably associated with a higher incidence of GI adverse events. A few studies have evaluated switching patients from DPP-4 inhibitors to a GLP-1RA and, as expected, improved glycemic control and weight loss are seen following the switch. According to current clinical guidelines, GLP-1RA and DPP-4 inhibitors are both indicated for the glycemic management of patients with T2DM across the spectrum of disease. GLP-1RA may be preferred over DPP- 4 inhibitors for many patients because of the greater reductions in hemoglobin A1c and weight loss observed in the clinical trials. Among patients with preexisting CVD, GLP-1 receptor agonists with a proven cardiovascular benefit are indicated as add-on to metformin therapy. Copyright © 2020 Gilbert and Pratley.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: When considering the administration of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs), sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, or metformin, it is important to understand their weight loss effect as well as the degree of muscle loss caused by each drug in clinical practice.

   OBJECTIVE: To comparatively examine the effects of GLP-1RAs and oral antidiabetic drugs, including SGLT2 inhibitors and metformin, on muscle mass and body weight in patients with type 2 diabetes via a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.

   METHODS: We included randomized controlled trials evaluating the effects of antidiabetic drugs on muscle mass and body weight. Mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a random-effects network meta-analysis.

   RESULTS: Of the studies identified, 18 randomized controlled trials (1, 363 subjects) satisfied the eligibility criteria. In all studies, the effects of these drugs on fat-free mass (FFM) were evaluated. Therefore, FFM, which is used as an alternative index of muscle mass, was included in the study. Semaglutide (MD: -1.68, 95% CI: -2.84 to -0.52), dapagliflozin (-0.53, -0.93 to -0.13), and canagliflozin (-0.90, -1.73 to -0.07) showed a significant decrease in FFM compared with the placebo. Metformin did not show a significant decrease in FFM compared with the placebo. When compared with the placebo, semaglutide, dapagliflozin, ipragliflozin, and canagliflozin showed a significant weight loss.

   CONCLUSION: Although semaglutide, dapaglifrozin, and canagliflozin have a large weight loss effect, it is important to pay attention to muscle loss because a decrease in FFM was observed. Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.

Abstract
  Sodium-glucose transporter (SGLT)2 inhibitors increase plasma magnesium and plasma phosphate and may cause ketoacidosis, but the contribution of improved glycemic control to these observations as well as effects on other electrolytes and acid-base parameters remain unknown. Therefore, our objective was to compare the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors dapagliflozin and sulfonylurea gliclazide on plasma electrolytes, urinary electrolyte excretion, and acid-base balance in people with Type 2 diabetes (T2D). We assessed the effects of dapagliflozin and gliclazide treatment on plasma electrolytes and bicarbonate, 24-hour urinary pH and excretions of electrolytes, ammonium, citrate, and sulfate in 44 metformin-treated people with T2D and preserved kidney function. Compared with gliclazide, dapagliflozin increased plasma chloride by 1.4 mmol/l (95% CI 0.4-2.4), plasma magnesium by 0.03 mmol/l (95% CI 0.01-0.06), and plasma sulfate by 0.02 mmol/l (95% CI 0.01-0.04). Compared with baseline, dapagliflozin also significantly increased plasma phosphate, but the same trend was observed with gliclazide. From baseline to week 12, dapagliflozin increased the urinary excretion of citrate by 0.93 +/- 1.72 mmol/day, acetoacetate by 48 mumol/day (IQR 17-138), and beta-hydroxybutyrate by 59 mumol/day (IQR 0-336), without disturbing acid-base balance. In conclusion, dapagliflozin increases plasma magnesium, chloride, and sulfate compared with gliclazide, while reaching similar glucose-lowering in people with T2D. Dapagliflozin also increases urinary ketone excretion without changing acid-base balance. Therefore, the increase in urinary citrate excretion by dapagliflozin may reflect an effect on cellular metabolism including the tricarboxylic acid cycle. This potentially contributes to kidney protection. Copyright © 2020 The Author(s). Published by Portland Press Limited on behalf of the Biochemical Society.

Abstract
  Objective: To assess patient-reported outcomes after two years of use of dual oral anti-diabetes drug (OAD) therapy in elderly people (>=65 years) with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) from Italy under real-life settings. Methods: 3-AGE was a prospective, non-interventional study in elderly people with T2DM inadequately controlled on metformin monotherapy (defined as glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c] 7.0-9.0%), in whom a second OAD was prescribed. Primary endpoint was to assess the physical and psychological symptoms associated with T2DM from baseline to 24 months using the Diabetes Symptom Check List revised (DSC-R) questionnaire. Patient's quality of life and health status, treatment satisfaction, consumption of healthcare resources, and physician satisfaction with treatment were also assessed (secondary endpoints) using validated questionnaires. Additionally, safety and clinical characteristics were also evaluated. Results: The mean age of the study population (N = 860) was 71.5 +/- 5.2 years. Addition of a second OAD significantly (p < .0001) reduced the DSC-R score from baseline (0.73 +/- 0.68) to both Months 12 and 24 (0.63 +/- 0.59 and 0.61 +/- 0.56), and HbA1c from baseline (7.72% +/- 0.54%) to Month 12 (6.95% +/- 0.82%). Adding a second OAD improved quality of life and health status (baseline, 71.31 +/- 15.16 to Month 12, 74.49 +/- 13.64; p < .0001), patient's treatment satisfaction (p < .0001), and consumption of healthcare resources per patient. Physicians expressed good satisfaction with patients' treatment (across efficacy, tolerability and compliance domains) at Month 12. Overall, 32 adverse reactions (in 24 patients) and four hypoglycemic episodes were reported during the 24 months. Conclusion:  Addition of a second OAD improved physical and psychological symptoms associated with T2DM and was well tolerated in elderly people under real-life settings.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Metformin is the most widely used oral antihyperglycemic agent for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Despite the possible benefits of metformin on diabetes mellitus (DM) and heart failure (HF), acute or unstable HF remains a precaution for its use.

   OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present prospective randomized controlled trial was to assess whether metformin treatment has beneficial effects on patients with T2DM with hypertension without overt HF.

   METHODS: A total of 164 patients (92 males, 72 females; median age 66 years) were included in this study. Patients with T2DM with a history of hypertension were randomized 1:1 to treatment for 1 year with either metformin (metformin-treated group) or other hypoglycemic agents (control group). The primary endpoints were changes in brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels, left ventricular (LV) mass index, and indicators of LV diastolic function. We also evaluated changes in both clinical findings and blood laboratory examination data.

   RESULTS: We observed no significant changes between baseline and 1-year post-treatment in LV mass index, BNP levels, or E/e' (early diastolic transmitral flow velocity/early diastolic mitral annular velocity; an indicator of LV diastolic function) in either the metformin-treated (n = 83) or the control (n = 81) groups. The metformin-treated group had a significant reduction of body mass index (BMI) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), but the control group did not. We determined that renal function, including serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate, deteriorated significantly in the control group but not in the metformin-treated group.

   CONCLUSION: LV mass and diastolic function were not affected after 1 year of metformin treatment in patients with T2DM. However, we observed benefits in terms of reductions in both BMI and LDL-C levels and preservation of renal function.

Abstract
  AIMS: The Italian Society of Diabetology and the Italian Association of Clinical Diabetologists are developing new guidelines for drug treatment of type 2 diabetes. The effects of anti-hyperglycaemic drugs on all-cause mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) were included among the critical clinical outcomes. We have therefore carried out an updated meta-analysis on the effects of metformin on these outcomes.

   DATA SYNTHESIS: A MEDLINE and EMBASE search was performed to identify all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with duration >=52 weeks (published up to August 2020), in which metformin was compared with either placebo/no therapy or active comparators. MACEs (restricted for RCT reporting MACEs within their study endpoints) and all-cause mortality (irrespective of the inclusion of MACEs among the pre-specified endpoints) were considered as the primary endpoints. Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio (MH-OR) with 95% confidence interval was calculated for all endpoints considered. Metformin was associated with a nonsignificant reduction of all-cause mortality (n = 13 RCTs; MH-OR 0.80 [95% CI 0.60, 1.07]). However, this association became statistically significant after excluding RCTs comparing metformin with sulfonylureas, SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 analogues (MH-OR 0.71 [0.51, 0.99]). Metformin was associated with a lower risk of MACEs compared with comparator treatments (n = 2 RCTs; MH-OR 0.52 [0.37, 0.73]), p < 0.001. Similar results were obtained in a post-hoc analysis including all RCTs fulfilling criteria for inclusion in the analysis (MH-OR: 0.57 [0.42, 0.76]).

   CONCLUSIONS: This updated meta-analysis suggests that metfomin is significantly associated with lower risk of MACEs and tendentially lower all-cause mortality compared to placebo or other anti-hyperglycaemic drugs.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: The prevalence of type 2 diabetes is increased in individuals with mental disorders. Much of the burden of disease falls on the populations of low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).

   OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of pharmacological, behaviour change, and organisational interventions versus active and non-active comparators in the prevention or delay of type 2 diabetes among people with mental illness in LMICs.

   SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and six other databases, as well as three international trials registries. We also searched conference proceedings and checked the reference lists of relevant systematic reviews. Searches are current up to 20 February 2020.

   SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of pharmacological, behavioural or organisational interventions targeting the prevention or delay of type 2 diabetes in adults with mental disorders in LMICs.

   DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Pairs of review authors working independently performed data extraction and risk of bias assessments. We conducted meta-analyses using random-effects models.

   MAIN RESULTS: One hospital-based RCT with 150 participants (99 participants with schizophrenia) addressed our review's primary outcome of prevention or delay of type 2 diabetes onset. Low-certainty evidence from this study did not show a difference between atypical and typical antipsychotics in the development of diabetes at six weeks (risk ratio (RR) 0.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.03 to 7.05) (among a total 99 participants with schizophrenia, 68 were in atypical and 31 were in typical antipsychotic groups; 55 participants without mental illness were not considered in the analysis). An additional 29 RCTs with 2481 participants assessed one or more of the review's secondary outcomes. All studies were conducted in hospital settings and reported on pharmacological interventions. One study, which we could not include in our meta-analysis, included an intervention with pharmacological and behaviour change components. We identified no studies of organisational interventions. Low- to moderate-certainty evidence suggests there may be no difference between the use of atypical and typical antipsychotics for the outcomes of drop-outs from care (RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.63 to 2.69; two studies with 144 participants), and fasting blood glucose levels (mean difference (MD) 0.05 lower, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.00; two studies with 211 participants). Participants who receive typical antipsychotics may have a lower body mass index (BMI) at follow-up than participants who receive atypical antipsychotics (MD 0.57, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.81; two studies with 141 participants; moderate certainty of evidence), and may have lower total cholesterol levels eight weeks after starting treatment (MD 0.35, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.43; one study with 112 participants). There was moderate certainty evidence suggesting no difference between the use of metformin and placebo for the outcomes of drop-outs from care (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.09 to 16.35; three studies with 158 participants). There was moderate-to-high certainty evidence of no difference between metformin and placebo for fasting blood glucose levels (endpoint data: MD -0.35, 95% CI -0.60 to -0.11; change from baseline data: MD 0.01, 95% CI -0.21 to 0.22; five studies with 264 participants). There was high certainty evidence that BMI was lower for participants receiving metformin compared with those receiving a placebo (MD -1.37, 95% CI -2.04 to -0.70; five studies with 264 participants; high certainty of evidence). There was no difference between metformin and placebo for the outcomes of waist circumference, blood pressure and cholesterol levels. Low-certainty evidence from one study (48 participants) suggests there may be no difference between the use of melatonin and placebo for the outcome of drop-outs from care (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.38 to 2.66). Fasting blood glucose is probably reduced more in participants treated with melatonin compared with placebo (endpoint data: MD -0.17, 95% CI -0.35 to 0.01; change from baseline data: MD -0.24, 95% CI -0.39 to -0.09; three studies with 202 participants, moderate-certainty evidence). There was no difference between melatonin and placebo for the outcomes of waist circumference, blood pressure and cholesterol levels. Very low-certainty evidence from one study (25 participants) suggests that drop-outs may be higher in participants treated with a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) compared with those receiving a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.11 to 1.01). It is uncertain if there is no difference in fasting blood glucose levels between these groups (MD -0.39, 95% CI -0.88 to 0.10; three studies with 141 participants, moderate-certainty evidence). It is uncertain if there is no difference in BMI and depression between the TCA and SSRI antidepressant groups.

   AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Only one study reported data on our primary outcome of interest, providing low-certainty evidence that there may be no difference in risk between atypical and typical antipsychotics for the outcome of developing type 2 diabetes. We are therefore not able to draw conclusions on the prevention of type 2 diabetes in people with mental disorders in LMICs. For studies reporting on secondary outcomes, there was evidence of risk of bias in the results. There is a need for further studies with participants from LMICs with mental disorders, particularly on behaviour change and on organisational interventions targeting prevention of type 2 diabetes in these populations.

Abstract
  We present the adaptation for Spain of the updated European Cardiovascular Prevention Guidelines. In this update, greater stress is laid on the population approach, and especially on the promotion of physical activity and healthy diet through dietary, leisure and active transport policies in Spain. To estimate vascular risk, note should be made of the importance of recalibrating the tables used, by adapting them to population shifts in the prevalence of risk factors and incidence of vascular diseases, with particular attention to the role of chronic kidney disease. At an individual level, the key element is personalised support for changes in behaviour, adherence to medication in high-risk individuals and patients with vascular disease, the fostering of physical activity, and cessation of smoking habit. Furthermore, recent clinical trials with PCSK9 inhibitors are reviewed, along with the need to simplify pharmacological treatment of arterial hypertension to improve control and adherence to treatment. In the case of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and vascular disease or high vascular disease risk, when lifestyle changes and metformin are inadequate, the use of drugs with proven vascular benefit should be prioritised. Lastly, guidelines on peripheral arterial disease and other specific diseases are included, as is a recommendation against prescribing antiaggregants in primary prevention.

Para estimar el riesgo vascular, se destaca la importancia de recalibrar las tablas que se utilicen, adaptandolas a los cambios poblaciones en la prevalencia de los factores de riesgo y en la incidencia de enfermedades vasculares, con particular atencion al papel de la enfermedad renal cronica. A nivel individual resulta clave el apoyo personalizado para el cambio de conducta, la adherencia a la medicacion en los individuos de alto riesgo y pacientes con enfermedad vascular, la promocion de la actividad fisica y el abandono del habito tabaquico. Ademas, se revisan los ensayos clinicos recientes con inhibidores de PCKS9, la necesidad de simplificar el tratamiento farmacologico de la hipertension arterial para mejorar su control y la adherencia al tratamiento. En los pacientes con diabetes mellitus 2 y enfermedad vascular o riesgo vascular alto, cuando los cambios de estilo de vida y la metformina resultan insuficientes, deben priorizarse los farmacos con demostrado beneficio vascular. Por ultimo, se incluyen pautas sobre enfermedad arterial periferica y otras enfermedades especificas, y se recomienda no prescribir antiagregantes en prevencion primaria. Language: Spanish

Abstract
  BACKGROUND & AIMS: Several observational studies have recently reported the outcomes of non-insulin anti-diabetic agents (ADA) in patients with T2DM and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We sought to review the literature to appraise the clinicians on these outcomes.

   METHODS: A literature search using the specific keywords was carried out in the database of PubMed, MedRxiv and Google Scholar up till December 11, 2020 applying Boolean method. Full text of all the relevant articles that reported the outcomes of ADA in patients with T2DM and COVID-19 were retrieved. Subsequently, an appraisal of literature report was narratively presented.

   RESULTS: Available studies that reported the outcomes of ADA are either case series or retrospective cohorts or prospective observational studies, in absence of the randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Results from these observational studies suggest that amongst all the non-insulin ADA, metformin users prior to the hospitalization had improved outcomes compared to the non-users. Data for dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4i) are encouraging although inconsistent. No documentation of any harm or benefit has been observed for sulfonylureas (SUs), sodium glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i) and glucagon-like peptide receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs). No data is yet available for pioglitazone.

   CONCLUSION: Metformin and DPP-4i should be continued in patients with T2DM until hospitalization or unless contraindicated. No evidence of harm suggests that SUs, SGLT-2i or GLP-1RAs may not be stopped unless very sick, hospitalized or contraindicated. The results from RCTs are needed to claim any meaningful benefit with either metformin or DPP-4i in patients with T2DM and COVID-19. Copyright © 2020 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVES: The present study was to quantitate and compare the efficacy of metformin on weight in different disease states using model-based meta-analysis (MBMA).

   METHODS: Randomized controlled trials (RCT) of metformin effects on weight in different disease states were collected by searching the public databases. The change rate of weight from baseline was selected as the efficacy indicator.

   RESULTS: A total 21 RCTs containing 1885 patients including patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, patients with antipsychotic induced weight gain, patients with obesity, were included into the present study. After deducting placebo effect, the maximal effect (Emax) of metformin on weight in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, patients with antipsychotic induced weight gain, patients with obesity were -6.86%, -8.82%, and -4.14%, respectively. The treatment duration to reach half of the maximal effect (ET50) were 107, 45.5, and 15.1 weeks, respectively. Within the metformin dose range from 21 RCTs, no significant dose-response relationship was observed. However, the time-course relationship is obvious for efficacy of metformin on weight.

   CONCLUSIONS: The present study firstly provided quantitative information for metformin effects on weight in different disease states, including patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, patients with antipsychotic induced weight gain, patients with obesity.

Abstract
  This study analyzed the effects of combination therapy with sodium-glucose transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) and metformin on fracture risk. Summarizing available randomized controlled trials, we found that SGLT2is combined with metformin therapy did not influence fracture risk compared with metformin monotherapy or other comparators in patients with T2DM.

   INTRODUCTION: No study is available evaluating the association between sodium-glucose transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) in combination with metformin use and fracture risk. Our study aimed to investigate the fracture risk of combination therapy with SGLT2is and metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

   METHODS: PubMed, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov site, and the Cochrane Library databases were scrutinized for all eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The summarized odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using Review Manager 5.3 software.

   RESULTS: A total of 25 RCTs involving 19,500 participants with T2DM were included in our studies. There were 88 fracture cases in the SGLT2is in combination with metformin therapy group and 79 in the control group. SGLT2is combined with metformin use did not influence fracture risk compared with metformin monotherapy or other comparators in patients with T2DM (OR = 0.97, 95% CI 0.71-1.32). After stratification by drug type, follow-up time, control regimen, and type of fracture, the upshots were still stable.

   CONCLUSION: SGLT2is and metformin combination therapy did not influence fracture risk compared with metformin monotherapy or other comparators in patients with T2DM.

Abstract
  Background We investigated the effects of insulin, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA), sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i), and their combination on vascular and cardiac function of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Methods and Results A total of 160 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were randomized to insulin (n=40), liraglutide (n=40), empagliflozin (n=40), or their combination (GLP-1RA+SGLT-2i) (n=40) as add-on to metformin. We measured at baseline and 4 and 12 months posttreatment: (a) perfused boundary region of the sublingual arterial microvessels (marker of endothelial glycocalyx thickness), (b) pulse wave velocity (PWV) and central systolic blood pressure, (c) global left ventricular longitudinal, circumferential, and radial strain, (d) myocardial work index (global work index) derived by pressure-myocardial strain loops using speckle tracking imaging. Twelve months posttreatment, all patients improved perfused boundary region, PWV, global longitudinal strain, global circumferential strain, and global radial strain (P<0.05). GLP-1RA, SGLT-2i, and their combination showed a greater reduction of perfused boundary region, PWV, and central systolic blood pressure than insulin, despite a similar glycosylated hemoglobin reduction (P<0.05). GLP-1RA or GLP-1RA+SGLT-2i provided a greater increase of global work index (12.7% and 17.4%) compared with insulin or SGLT-2i (3.1% and 2%). SGLT-2i or GLP-1RA and SGLT-2i showed a greater decrease of PWV (10.1% and 13%) and central and brachial systolic blood pressure than insulin or GLP-1RA (PWV, 3.6% and 8.6%) (P<0.05 for all comparisons). The dual therapy showed the greatest effect on measured markers in patients with left ventricular ejection fraction <55% (P<0.05). Conclusions Twelve-month treatment with GLP-1RA, SGLT-2i, and their combination showed a greater improvement of vascular markers and effective cardiac work than insulin treatment in type 2 diabetes mellitus. The combined therapy as second line was superior to either insulin or GLP-1RA and SGLT-2i separately. Registration URL: https://www.clini caltr ials.gov. Unique identifier: NCT03878706.

Abstract
  ABSTRACT: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a progressive disease. After metformin failure, the addition of insulin or sulfonylureas might increase the risk of hypoglycemia and cardiovascular (CV) morbidity. Here, the risk of all-cause mortality was compared between early insulin treatment and glimepiride use in T2DM patients with background metformin therapy. We conducted a 9-year retrospective cohort study from the population-based National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan. A total of 2054 patients with T2DM under insulin or glimepiride treatment were enrolled during 2004 to 2012. Overall event rates of all-cause mortality were compared between 1027 insulin users and 1027 matched glimepiride users.After the propensity score matching, the mortality rates were 72.5 and 4.42 per 1000 person-years for insulin users and glimepiride users. The adjusted hazard ratio of mortality was 14.47 (95% CI: 8.64-24.24; P value <.001) as insulin compared with glimepiride users. The insulin users had significantly higher risk of CV death (adjusted hazard ratio 7.95, 95% CI 1.65-38.3, P = .01) and noncardiovascular death (adjusted hazard ratio 14.9, 95% CI 8.4-26.3, P < .001). The nationwide study demonstrated that metformin plus insulin therapy was associated with higher risk of all-cause mortality. Copyright © 2021 the Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Abstract
  PURPOSE: Although there are many different methods of treating type 2 diabetes (T2D), it is still difficult to draw coincident conclusions concerning the efficacy and safety of different classes of new drugs, and the recommendation level of them has still kept uncertain as second anti-diabetic agents. Therefore, the aim of this study was to summarize evidence on the efficacy and safety of DPP-4is, GLP-1RAs and SGLT-2is as monotherapy or add-on to metformin (Met) for treatment of T2D.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane library and ClinicalTrials.gov for relevant articles in keeping with established methods using terms associated with anti-diabetic agents up to February, 2020, with no start date restriction. Weighted mean difference and risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated within traditional and network meta-analysis. Primary outcomes were the mean change in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), fasting plasma glucose (FPG) change and the frequency of hypoglycemic events from baseline after 12 weeks of treatment.

   RESULTS: In total, 64 eligible studies comprising 37,780 patients and 7 treatment strategies were included. The results of primary outcomes showed that GLP-1RAs were significantly more effective than DPP-4is or SGLT-2is in reducing HbA1c when add-on to Met. For FPG, both GLP-1RAs and SGLT-2is significantly reduced FPG compared with DPP-4is whether add-on to Met or not. For hypoglycemia, monotherapy has a lower risk than combination therapy except for SGLT-2is. Ranking probability analysis indicated that GLP-1RAs and SGLT-2is, respectively, reduced HbA1c and FPG most when add-on to Met. Meanwhile, GLP-1RAs took the lowest risk to induce the hypoglycemia, whereas GLP-1RAs plus Met the highest.

   CONCLUSIONS: Both GLP-1RAs and SGLT-2is have their own advantages in efficacy and safety. Monotherapy is beneficial for reducing the risk of hypoglycemia. The recommendation should be a patient-centered approach when selecting treatment choices.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the effect of optimizing metformin dosing on glycemia and body weight in type 2 diabetes.

   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a prespecified analysis of 6,823 participants in the Glycemia Reduction Approaches in Diabetes: A Comparative Effectiveness Study (GRADE) taking metformin as the sole glucose-lowering drug who completed a 4- to 14-week (mean +/- SD 7.9 +/- 2.4) run-in in which metformin was adjusted to 2,000 mg/day or a maximally tolerated lower dose. Participants had type 2 diabetes for <10 years and an HbA1c >=6.8% (51 mmol/mol) while taking >=500 mg of metformin/day. Participants also received diet and exercise counseling. The primary outcome was the change in HbA1c during run-in.

   RESULTS: Adjusted for duration of run-in, the mean +/- SD change in HbA1c was -0.65 +/- 0.02% (-7.1 +/- 0.2 mmol/mol) when the dose was increased by >=1,000 mg/day, -0.48 +/- 0.02% (-5.2 +/- 0.2 mmol/mol) when the dose was unchanged, and -0.23 +/- 0.07% (-2.5 +/- 0.8 mmol/mol) when the dose was decreased (n = 2,169, 3,548, and 192, respectively). Higher HbA1c at entry predicted greater reduction in HbA1c (P < 0.001) in univariate and multivariate analyses. Weight loss adjusted for duration of run-in averaged 0.91 +/- 0.05 kg in participants who increased metformin by >=1,000 mg/day (n = 1,894).

   CONCLUSIONS: Optimizing metformin to 2,000 mg/day or a maximally tolerated lower dose combined with emphasis on medication adherence and lifestyle can improve glycemia in type 2 diabetes and HbA1c values >=6.8% (51 mmol/mol). These findings may help guide efforts to optimize metformin therapy among persons with type 2 diabetes and suboptimal glycemic control. Copyright © 2020 by the American Diabetes Association.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: Metformin is the first pharmacological option for treating type 2 diabetes. However, the use of this drug is not recommended in individuals with impaired kidney function because of the perceived risk of lactic acidosis. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of metformin in patients with type 2 diabetic kidney disease (DKD).

   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational cohort study of 10,426 patients with type 2 DKD from two tertiary hospitals. The primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) progression. The secondary outcome was metformin-associated lactic acidosis. Taking into account the possibility that patients with less severe disease were prescribed metformin, propensity score matching (PSM) was conducted.

   RESULTS: All-cause mortality and incident ESRD were lower in the metformin group according to the multivariate Cox analysis. Because the two groups had significantly different baseline characteristics, PSM was performed. After matching, metformin usage was still associated with lower all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.65; 95% CI 0.57-0.73; P < 0.001) and ESRD progression (aHR 0.67; 95% CI 0.58-0.77; P < 0.001). Only one event of metformin-associated lactic acidosis was recorded. In both the original and PSM groups, metformin usage did not increase the risk of lactic acidosis events from all causes (aHR 0.92; 95% CI 0.668-1.276; P = 0.629).

   CONCLUSIONS: In the present retrospective study, metformin usage in advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients, especially those with CKD 3B, decreased the risk of all-cause mortality and incident ESRD. Additionally, metformin did not increase the risk of lactic acidosis. However, considering the remaining biases even after PSM, further randomized controlled trials are needed to change real-world practice. Copyright © 2020 by the American Diabetes Association.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of combination therapy with canagliflozin plus liraglutide on HbA1c, endogenous glucose production (EGP), and body weight versus each therapy alone.

   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Forty-five patients with poorly controlled (HbA1c 7-11%) type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) on metformin with or without sulfonylurea received a 9-h measurement of EGP with [3-3H]glucose infusion, after which they were randomized to receive 1) liraglutide 1.2 mg/day (LIRA), 2) canagliflozin 100 mg/day (CANA), or 3) liraglutide 1.2 mg plus canagliflozin 100 mg (CANA/LIRA) for 16 weeks. At 16 weeks, the EGP measurement was repeated.

   RESULTS: The mean decrease from baseline to 16 weeks in HbA1c was -1.67 +/- 0.29% (P = 0.0001), -0.89 +/- 0.24% (P = 0.002), and -1.44 +/- 0.39% (P = 0.004) in patients receiving CANA/LIRA, CANA, and LIRA, respectively. The decrease in body weight was -6.0 +/- 0.8 kg (P < 0.0001), -3.5 +/- 0.5 kg (P < 0.0001), and -1.9 +/- 0.8 kg (P = 0.03), respectively. CANA monotherapy caused a 9% increase in basal rate of EGP (P < 0.05), which was accompanied by a 50% increase (P < 0.05) in plasma glucagon-to-insulin ratio. LIRA monotherapy reduced plasma glucagon concentration and inhibited EGP. In CANA/LIRA-treated patients, EGP increased by 15% (P < 0.05), even though the plasma insulin response was maintained at baseline and the CANA-induced rise in plasma glucagon concentration was blocked.

   CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that liraglutide failed to block the increase in EGP caused by canagliflozin despite blocking the rise in plasma glucagon and preventing the decrease in plasma insulin concentration caused by canagliflozin. The failure of liraglutide to prevent the increase in EGP caused by canagliflozin explains the lack of additive effect of these two agents on HbA1c.

Abstract
  Early treatment may prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in individuals who are at high risk. Lifestyle interventions and the hypoglycemic drug metformin have been shown to reduce T2DM incidence. The effectiveness of such interventions may be enhanced by targeting environmental factors such as the intestinal microbiota, which has been proven to predict the response to lifestyle interventions and play a part in mediating the glucose-lowering effects of metformin. Shifts in the intestinal microbiota "towards a more balanced state" may promote glucose homeostasis by regulating short-chain fatty acids' production. This study aimed to investigate the safety and effect of a multi-strain probiotic on glycemic, inflammatory, and permeability markers in adults with prediabetes and early T2DM and to assess whether the probiotic can enhance metformin's effect on glycaemia. A randomised controlled pilot study was conducted in 60 adults with a BMI >= 25 kg/m2 and with prediabetes or T2DM (within the previous 12 months). The participants were randomised to a multi-strain probiotic (L. plantarum, L. bulgaricus, L. gasseri, B. breve, B. animalis sbsp. lactis, B. bifidum, S. thermophilus, and S. boulardii) or placebo for 12 weeks. Analyses of the primary outcome (fasting plasma glucose) and secondary outcomes, including, but not limited to, circulating lipopolysaccharide, zonulin, and short chain fatty acids and a metagenomic analysis of the fecal microbiome were performed at baseline and 12 weeks post-intervention. The results showed no significant differences in the primary and secondary outcome measures between the probiotic and placebo group. An analysis of a subgroup of participants taking metformin showed a decrease in fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c, insulin resistance, and zonulin; an increase in plasma butyrate concentrations; and an enrichment of microbial butyrate-producing pathways in the probiotic group but not in the placebo group. Probiotics may act as an adjunctive to metformin by increasing the production of butyrate, which may consequently enhance glucose management.

Abstract
  AIMS: The alpha-glucosidase inhibitor acarbose is believed to reduce plasma glucose by delaying hydrolysis of carbohydrates. Acarbose-induced transfer of carbohydrates to the distal parts of the intestine increases circulating glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1). Using the GLP-1 receptor antagonist exendin(9-39)NH2, we investigated the effect of acarbose-induced GLP-1 secretion on postprandial glucose metabolism in patients with type 2 diabetes.

   METHODS: In a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover study, 15 participants with metformin-treated type 2 diabetes (age: 57-85 years, HbA1c: 40-74 mmol/mol) were subjected to two 14-day treatment periods with acarbose or placebo, respectively, separated by a 6-week wash-out period. At the end of each period, two randomized 4-h liquid mixed meal tests with concomitant infusion of exendin(9-39)NH2 and saline, respectively, were performed.

   RESULTS: Compared to placebo, acarbose increased postprandial GLP-1 concentrations and decreased postprandial glucose. We observed no absolute difference in the exendin(9-39)NH2-induced increase in postprandial glucose excursions between placebo and acarbose periods, but relatively, postprandial glucose was increased by 119 +/- 116% (mean +/- s.d.) during exendin(9-39)NH2 infusion in the acarbose period vs a 39 +/- 27% increase during the placebo period (P = 0.0163).

   CONCLUSIONS: We confirm that acarbose treatment stimulates postprandial GLP-1 secretion in patients with type 2 diabetes. Using exendin(9-39)NH2, we did not see an impact of acarbose-induced GLP-1 secretion on absolute measures of postprandial glucose tolerance, but relatively, the effect of exendin(9-39)NH2 was most pronounced during acarbose treatment.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Low-calorie sweetened beverages (LCSBs) are commonly used as a lower-calorie alternative to sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) by individuals with type 2 diabetes. However, little is known about how intake of LCSBs is related to dietary intake and cardiometabolic health, particularly among youth.

   OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that having higher baseline LCSB intake and increasing LCSB intake over 2 years of follow-up are associated with poorer dietary intake and higher cardiometabolic risk factors among youth enrolled in the Treatment Option for Type 2 Diabetes in Adolescents and Youth (TODAY) study.

   DESIGN: Secondary, exploratory, analysis of baseline and longitudinal data from the TODAY study, which was a randomized, multisite trial conducted from 2004 to 2012, to compare effects of 3 interventions (metformin alone, metformin + rosiglitazone, and metformin + intensive lifestyle intervention) on glycemic control in youth with type 2 diabetes.

   PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: The study included 476 children and adolescents (10-17 years, mean body mass index 34.9 +/- 7.8 kg/m2), who were participants in the multicenter (n = 15) TODAY study.

   MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Diet was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire. Differences in energy intake, macronutrients, food group intakes, and cardiometabolic biomarkers were evaluated in 3 groups of LCSB consumers at baseline (low [1-4 servings/wk], medium [5-11 servings/wk], and high [>=12 servings/wk]), each compared with nonconsumers, and between 4 groups of change in LCSB intake (nonconsumption at start of study and nonconsumption after 2 years, increase in consumption after 2 years, decrease in consumption after 2 years, and high consumption at start of study and high consumption after 2 years).

   STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: Multivariable linear regression was performed at baseline and longitudinally over 2 years of follow-up.

   RESULTS: Energy (kilocalories), fiber, carbohydrate, total fat, saturated fat, and protein intake (grams) were higher among high LCSB consumers compared with nonconsumers at baseline. No associations were observed between LCSB consumption and cardiometabolic risk factors at baseline. Change in LCSB intake between baseline and follow-up was not associated with change in energy intake or cardiometabolic risk factors. Participants who decreased LCSB consumption reported greater increases in sugar intake (18.4 +/- 4.8 g) compared with those who increased LCSB consumption (5.7 +/- 4.9 g) or remained high LCSB consumers (5.9 +/- 7.4 g), but this trend was not statistically significant after a correction for multiple testing.

   CONCLUSIONS: LCSB consumption was associated with higher energy intake in youth with type 2 diabetes, with the highest energy intakes reported in high LCSB consumers. Those who reduced LCSB consumption tended to report greater increases in sugar intake during follow-up, but further studies are needed to better understand this trend.

Abstract
  Close connections between depression and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) have been suggested by many epidemiological and experimental studies. Disturbances in insulin sensitivity due to the disruption of various molecular pathways cause insulin resistance, which underpins many metabolic disorders, including diabetes, as well as depression. Several anti-hyperglycemic agents have demonstrated antidepressant properties in clinical trials, probably due to their action on brain targets based on the shared pathophysiology of depression and T2DM. In this article, we review reports of clinical trials examining the antidepressant effect of these medications, including insulin, metformin, glucagon like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma agonists, and briefly consider possible molecular mechanisms underlying the associations between amelioration of insulin resistance and improvement of depressive symptoms. In doing so, we intend to suggest an integrative perspective for understanding the pathophysiology of depression.

Abstract
  CONTEXT: This study applied the Swedish novel data-driven classification in Chinese newly diagnosed diabetic patients and validated its adoptability.

   OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to validate the practicality of the Swedish diabetes regrouping scheme in Chinese adults with newly diagnosed diabetes.

   DESIGN: Patients were classified into 5 subgroups by K-means and Two-Step methods according to 6 clinical parameters.

   SETTING: Ambulatory care.

   PATIENTS: A cross-sectional survey of 15 772 patients with adult-onset newly diagnosed diabetes was conducted in China from April 2015 to October 2017.

   INTERVENTION: None.

   MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Six parameters including glutamate decarboxylase antibodies (GADA), age of onset, body mass index (BMI), glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), homoeostatic model assessment 2 estimates of beta-cell function (HOMA2-B) and insulin resistance (HOMA2-IR) were measured to calculate the patient subgroups.

   RESULTS: Our patients clustered into 5 subgroups: 6.2% were in the severe autoimmune diabetes (SAID) subgroup, 24.8% were in the severe insulin-deficient diabetes (SIDD) subgroup, 16.6% were in the severe insulin-resistance diabetes (SIRD) subgroup, 21.6% were in the mild obesity-related diabetes (MOD) subgroup and 30.9% were in the mild age-related diabetes (MARD) subgroup. When compared with the Swedish population, the proportion of SIDD subgroup was higher. In general, Chinese patients had younger age, lower BMI, higher HbA1c, lower HOMA2-B and HOMA2-IR, and higher insulin use but lower metformin usage than the Swedish patients.

   CONCLUSION: The Swedish diabetes regrouping scheme is applicable to adult-onset diabetes in China, with a high proportion of patients with the severe insulin deficient diabetes. Further validations of long-term diabetes complications remain warranted in future studies. Copyright © Endocrine Society 2020. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: Tachyphylaxis for slowing of gastric emptying is seen with continuous exposure to glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1). We therefore aimed to establish whether prolonged use of a "short-acting" GLP-1 receptor agonist, lixisenatide, achieves sustained slowing of gastric emptying and reduction in postprandial glycemia.

   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 30 patients with metformin-treated type 2 diabetes underwent assessment of gastric emptying (scintigraphy) and glucose metabolism (dual tracer technique) after a 75-g glucose drink, before and after 8 weeks' treatment with lixisenatide (20 mug subcutaneously daily) or placebo, in a double-blind randomized parallel design.

   RESULTS: Gastric retention of the glucose drink was markedly increased after lixisenatide versus placebo (ratio of adjusted geometric means for area under the curve [AUC] over 240 min of 2.19 [95% CI 1.82, 2.64], P < 0.001), associated with substantial reductions in the rate of systemic appearance of oral glucose (P < 0.001) and incremental AUC for blood glucose (P < 0.001). Lixisenatide suppressed both glucagon (P = 0.003) and insulin (P = 0.032), but not endogenous glucose production, over 120 min after oral glucose intake. Postprandial glucose lowering over 240 min was strongly related to the magnitude of slowing of gastric emptying by lixisenatide (r = -0.74, P = 0.002) and to the baseline rate of emptying (r = 0.52, P = 0.048) but unrelated to beta-cell function (assessed by beta-cell glucose sensitivity).

   CONCLUSIONS: Eight weeks' treatment with lixisenatide is associated with sustained slowing of gastric emptying and marked reductions in postprandial glycemia and appearance of ingested glucose. Short-acting GLP-1 receptor agonists therefore potentially represent an effective long-term therapy for specifically targeting postprandial glucose excursions.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of fast-acting insulin aspart (faster aspart) compared with insulin aspart (IAsp), both with insulin degludec with or without metformin, in adults with type 2 diabetes not optimally controlled with a basal-bolus regimen.

   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This multicenter, double-blind, treat-to-target trial randomized participants to faster aspart (n = 546) or IAsp (n = 545). All available information, regardless of treatment discontinuation or use of ancillary treatment, was used for evaluation of effect.

   RESULTS: Noninferiority for the change from baseline in HbA1c 16 weeks after randomization (primary end point) was confirmed for faster aspart versus IAsp (estimated treatment difference [ETD] -0.04% [95% CI -0.11; 0.03]; -0.39 mmol/mol [-1.15; 0.37]; P < 0.001). Faster aspart was superior to IAsp for change from baseline in 1-h postprandial glucose (PPG) increment using a meal test (ETD -0.40 mmol/L [-0.66; -0.14]; -7.23 mg/dL [-11.92; -2.55]; P = 0.001 for superiority). Change from baseline in self-measured 1-h PPG increment for the mean over all meals favored faster aspart (ETD -0.25 mmol/L [-0.42; -0.09]); -4.58 mg/dL [-7.59; -1.57]; P = 0.003). The overall rate of treatment-emergent severe or blood glucose (BG)-confirmed hypoglycemia was statistically significantly lower for faster aspart versus IAsp (estimated treatment ratio 0.81 [95% CI 0.68; 0.97]).

   CONCLUSIONS: In combination with insulin degludec, faster aspart provided effective overall glycemic control, superior PPG control, and a lower rate of severe or BG-confirmed hypoglycemia versus IAsp in adults with type 2 diabetes not optimally controlled with a basal-bolus regimen.

Abstract
  AIMS/INTRODUCTION: To explore the factors associated with the glucose-lowering efficacy of sitagliptin treatment in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a post-hoc analysis of pooled data from seven sitagliptin phase II and III clinical studies carried out in Japan. All studies were double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group and of 12-week duration. The analysis population consisted of 1,075 type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. In two of the trials, sitagliptin 50 mg and/or 100 mg daily were used as monotherapy; in five others, sitagliptin 50 mg daily was used as add-on treatment to ongoing pioglitazone, glimepiride, metformin, voglibose or glinides. Efficacy (reduction in hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c]) was evaluated in 12 sets of subgroups defined by demographic, glycemic, pancreatic beta-cell function and insulin resistance parameters. An analysis of covariance model was used to evaluate the interaction between each parameter and efficacy.

   RESULTS: Sitagliptin consistently provided a clinically meaningful reduction in HbA1c relative to placebo across all subgroups. Within subgroups, a greater absolute HbA1c reduction was associated with higher baseline HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose and 2-h post-meal glucose. Lower beta-cell function, represented by homeostatic model assessment of beta-cell function and insulinogenic index, was also associated with greater HbA1c reduction. In contrast, age, sex, body mass index, duration of type 2 diabetes mellitus and insulin resistance-related parameters did not interact with HbA1c changes.

   CONCLUSIONS: Sitagliptin treatment was associated with clinically meaningful improvement in glycemic control in all subgroups of Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus that were evaluated. Higher baseline glycemic status and lower baseline beta-cell function were identified as factors associated with greater HbA1c reduction after sitagliptin treatment.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) often experience hypoglycaemia and weight gain due to treatment side effects. Sulfonylureas (SU) and the combination of SU and metformin (SU+MET) were the most common monotherapy and combination therapies used in Thailand tertiary care hospitals. This study aimed to assess the glycaemic goal attainment rates, hypoglycaemic episodes, weight gain and treatment compliance among patients with T2DM receiving SU or SU+MET.

   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A multicentre cross-sectional survey and retrospective review was conducted in five tertiary care hospitals, Thailand. Patients with T2DM aged >=30 years were included consecutively during a 12-month period. Glycaemic control, experiences of hypoglycaemia, weight gain and compliance were evaluated. Glycaemic goal attainment was defined by HbA1c level less than 7%.

   RESULTS: Out of the 659 patients (mean age (+/-SD)), 65.5 (10.0) years and median duration of T2DM (IQR), 10 (5-15) years), 313 (47.5%) achieved the glycaemic goal. HbA1c levels in the patients with goal attainment was significantly lower compared with those without (6.3%+/-0.5% vs 8.1%+/-1.2%, p<0.001). Goal attainment was significantly lower among patients treated with SU+MET than those treated with SU alone (43.5% vs 63.0%; OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.31, 0.66, p<0.001). A third of patients reported experiencing hypoglycaemia (30.7%) and weight gain (35.4%). Weight gain in the SU+MET group was lower than those receiving SU alone (33.1% vs 44.6%, p=0.015), but there was no difference in hypoglycaemic events. Major events in the previous 12 months were experienced by 68 patients, most commonly congestive heart failure and ischaemic heart disease. Approximately half of the patients (52.2%) reported not always taking their medication as prescribed.

   CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with T2DM receiving SU or SU+MET, only about half of the patients achieved glycaemic goal and compliance with the treatment. Hypoglycaemia and weight gain posed a significant burden with risk of weight gain higher in the SU group. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Recently, many clinical experiments have evaluated the influences of liraglutide in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. However, the outcomes of these studies are inconsistent, and the number of high-quality prospective trials that conducted to assess the cardiovascular safety is limited. Hence, for this research, it was implemented for the assessment of the cardiovascular effectiveness and safety of liraglutide in type 2 diabetes patients.

   METHODS: This research was a 26-week active controlled and randomized trial. Our research protocol follows the guidelines of Good Clinical Practice issued via the Helsinki Declaration and International Conference on Coordination. All the patients will receive the written informed consent in order to involve in our clinical experiment. The participants with type 2 diabetes aged from 18 years to 80 years, patients with 45.0 kg/m2 body-mass index or less, and with glycosylated hemoglobin of 7.5 to 10.0 percent, and received metformin (daily 1500 mg or more) for 3 months or longer were eligible. All the patients were randomized to 1 of 2 interventions (in the ratio of 1:1): liraglutide placebo once daily (blinded) and liraglutide once daily (blinded), respectively, both combined with the glimepiride and metformin (open-labeled). For the efficacy variable, the major endpoint was the baseline glycated hemoglobin change after treating for 26 weeks. The secondary end points involved: the percentage of participants who achieved the goals of postprandial blood glucose, fasting blood glucose, and glycosylated hemoglobin; the changes of mean postprandial blood glucose, fasting blood glucose, and the body weight, pancreatic B-cell function index, and changes in blood pressure and insulin resistance assessed by homeostasis model.

   CONCLUSIONS: For this research, the limitations involve the short trial period and the limitation of glimepiride in some countries, thus excluding the maximum doses of glimepiride.

Abstract
  CONTEXT: No head-to-head trials have directly compared once-weekly (OW) semaglutide, a human glucagon-like peptide-1 analog, with empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor, in type 2 diabetes (T2D).

   OBJECTIVE: We indirectly compared the efficacy of OW semaglutide 1 mg vs once-daily (OD) empagliflozin 25 mg in patients with T2D inadequately controlled on metformin monotherapy, using individual patient data (IPD) and meta-regression methodology.

   DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, AND INTERVENTIONS: IPD for patients with T2D receiving metformin monotherapy and randomized to OW semaglutide 1 mg (SUSTAIN 2, 3, 8 trials), or to OD empagliflozin 25 mg (PIONEER 2 trial) were included. Meta-regression analyses were adjusted for potential prognostic factors and effect modifiers.

   MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary efficacy outcomes were change from baseline to end-of-treatment (~1 year) in HbA1c (%-point) and body weight (kg). Responder outcomes and other clinically relevant efficacy measures were analyzed.

   RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were similar between OW semaglutide (n = 995) and empagliflozin (n = 410). Our analyses showed that OW semaglutide significantly reduced mean HbA1c and body weight vs empagliflozin (estimated treatment difference: -0.61%-point [95% confidence interval (CI): -0.72; -0.49] and -1.65 kg [95% CI: -2.22; -1.08], respectively; both P < 0.0001). Complementary analyses supported the robustness of these results. A significantly greater proportion of patients on OW semaglutide vs empagliflozin also achieved HbA1c targets and weight-loss responses.

   CONCLUSIONS: This indirect comparison suggests that OW semaglutide 1 mg provides superior reductions in HbA1c and body weight vs OD empagliflozin 25 mg in patients with T2D when added to metformin monotherapy.

Abstract
  Metformin has undisputed glucose-lowering effects in diabetes and an impressive safety record. It has also shown promising effects beyond diabetes, and several hundred clinical trials involving metformin are currently planned or active. Metformin targets intracellular effectors, but exactly which remain to be established, and in an era of precision medicine, an incomplete understanding of mechanisms of action may limit the use of metformin. Distribution of metformin depends on specific organic cation transporter proteins that are organ- and species-specific. Therefore, target tissues of metformin can be identified by cellular uptake of the drug, and exploring the biodistribution of the drug in humans becomes an attractive strategy to assist the many investigations into the mechanisms of action of metformin performed in animals. In this review, we combine the emerging evidence from the use of 11C-labeled metformin in humans to discuss metformin action in liver, intestines, and kidney, which are the organs with the most avid uptake of the drug.

Abstract
  Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major contributor to the morbidity and mortality associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). With T2DM growing in pandemic proportions, there will be profound healthcare implications of CVD in person with diabetes. The ideal drugs to improve outcomes in T2DM are those having antiglycemic efficacy in addition to cardiovascular (CV) safety, which has to be determined in appropriately designed CV outcome trials as mandated by regulatory agencies. Available evidence is largely supportive of metformin's CV safety and potential CVD risk reduction effects, whereas sulfonylureas are either CV risk neutral or are associated with variable CVD risk. Pioglitazone was also associated with improved CVD risk in patients with diabetes. The more recent antihyperglycemic medications have shown promise with regards to CVD risk reduction in T2DM patients at a high CV risk. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, a type of incretin-based therapy, were associated with better CV outcomes and mortality in T2DM patients, leading to the Food and Drug Administration approval of liraglutide to reduce CVD risk in high-risk T2DM patients. Ongoing and planned randomized controlled trials of the newer drugs should clarify the possibility of class effects, and of CVD risk reduction benefits in low-moderate CV risk patients. While metformin remains the first-line antiglycemic therapy in T2DM, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists should be appropriately prescribed in T2DM patients with baseline CVD or in those at a high CVD risk to improve CV outcomes. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors are discussed in the second part of this review.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Individual health behaviors (ie, eating habits and sedentary lifestyle) are associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Health behavior profiles specific to adolescents with T2D have not been described.

   OBJECTIVE: To identify health behavior profiles in adolescents with T2D and examine how these profiles change over time.

   METHODS: Diet (via food frequency questionnaire) and activity behaviors (via 3-day physical activity recall) examined at baseline, 6 months, and 24 months from participants in the the Treatment Options for T2D in Adolescents and Youth (TODAY) study were used for this analysis. Latent profile analysis identified profiles of health behaviors within three time points, and latent transition probabilities were estimated to examine the change from baseline to 6 months (n = 450) and baseline to 24 months (n = 415). Multinomial logistic regressions were used to examine if the assigned TODAY treatment group (Metformin [Met], Met + Rosiglitazone [Rosi], or Met + Lifestyle) predicted change in health behavior profiles.

   RESULTS: Three profiles emerged: "most sedentary," "healthy eaters," and "active and eat most." At 6 months, 50% of males and 29% of females in the Met + Lifestyle treatment group improved in their health behavior profile. Among males only, the Met + Lifestyle treatment group were more likely to improve their profiles from baseline to 6 months (P = .01).

   CONCLUSIONS: Three health behavior profiles emerged and shifted over time. A high quality, lifestyle intervention had little effect on improving health behavior profiles. Optimizing outcomes in youth with T2D might require more robust and multifaceted interventions beyond family-level lifestyle, including more extensive psychosocial intervention, novel medication regimen, or bariatric surgery.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are at risk for a variety of severe debilitating effects. One of the most serious complications experienced by patients with T2DM are skeletal diseases caused by changes in the bone microenvironment. As a result, patients with T2DM are at risk for higher prevalence of fragility fractures. There are a variety of treatments available for counteracting this effect. Some antidiabetic medications, such as metformin, have been shown to have a positive effect on bone health without the addition of additional drugs into patients' treatment plans. Chinese randomised controlled trial (RCT) studies have also proposed antiosteoporotic pharmacotherapies as a viable alternative treatment strategy. Previous network meta-analyses (NMAs) and meta-analyses regarding this topic did not include all available RCT trials, or only performed pairwise comparisons. We present a protocol for a two-part NMA that incorporates all available RCT data to provide the most comprehensive ranking of antidiabetics (part I) and antiosteoporotic (part II) pharmacotherapies in terms of their ability to decrease fracture incidences, increase bone mineral density (BMD) and improve indications of bone turnover markers (BTMs) in adult patients with T2DM.

   METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will search Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online, Excerpta Medica Database, PubMed, Web of Science, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Chinese literature sources (China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chongqing VIP Information, Wanfang Data, Wanfang Med Online) for RCTs, which fit our criteria. We will include adult patients with T2DM who have taken antidiabetics (part I) or antiosteoporotic (part II) therapies with relevant outcome measures in our study. We will perform title/abstract and full-text screening as well as data extraction in duplicate. Risk of bias will be evaluated in duplicate for each study, and the quality of evidence will be examined using Confidence in Network Meta-Analysis in accordance to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework. We will use R and gemtc to perform the NMA. We will report changes in BMD and BTMs in either weighted or standardised mean difference, and we will report fracture incidences as ORs. We will use the Surface Under the Cumulative Ranking Curve scores to provide numerical estimates of the rankings of interventions.

   ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study will not require ethics approval. The findings of the two-part NMA will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals and presented at conferences. We aim to produce the most comprehensive quantitative analysis regarding the management of T2DM bone disease. Our analysis should be able to provide physicians and patients with up-to-date recommendations for antidiabetic medications and antiosteoporotic pharmacotherapies for maintaining bone health in patients with T2DM.

Abstract
  Metformin may decrease cell senescence, including bone; hence we aimed at evaluating the association between metformin use and osteoporosis. This was a cross-sectional study carried out in 1259 Latin American adult women aged 40 or more who were not on anti-osteoporotic drugs, were on metformin and had a bone densitometry performed. Of the whole sample, 40.3% reported being on metformin (at least 1 year), 30.2% had type 2 diabetes mellitus and 22.6% had osteoporosis. Median (interquartile range) body mass index (BMI) for the whole cohort was 27.7 (4.6) kg/m2 and 30.2% had type 2 diabetes mellitus. Current use of hormone therapy, calcium, and vitamin D corresponded respectively to 10.7%, 47.7%, and 43.1% of all surveyed women. A logistic regression model was used to analyze the association of osteoporosis with various covariates incorporated into the model such as age (OR: 1.07, 95% CI: 1.05-1.09), BMI (OR: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.89-0.96) and metformin use (OR: 0.44, 95% CI: 0.32-0.59). Metformin use, regardless of the presence of type 2 diabetes or obesity, was associated with a lower risk of osteoporosis in adult women. We propose that one explanation for this observation could be the effect of the drug over cellular senescence.

Abstract
  AIMS: Preserved vascular function represents a key prognostic factor in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), but data on vascular parameters in this patient cohort are scarce. Patients with T2DM often need more than one drug to achieve optimal glucose control. The aim of this study was to analyse the efficacy of two combination therapies on vascular function in subjects with T2DM.

   METHODS AND RESULTS: This prospective, randomized study included 97 subjects with T2DM. Subjects were randomized to either the combination therapy empagliflozin (E) 10 mg with linagliptin (L) 5 mg once daily or metformin (M) 850 or 1000 mg twice daily with insulin glargine (I) once daily. At baseline and after 12 weeks, subjects had peripheral office and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure (BP) measurement and underwent vascular assessment by pulse wave analysis under office and ambulatory conditions. Office, 24-h ambulatory and central BP as well as pulse pressure (PP) decreased after 12 weeks of treatment with E + L, whereas no change was observed in M + I. There were greater decreases in 24-h ambulatory peripheral systolic (between-group difference: -5.2 +/- 1.5 mmHg, P = 0.004), diastolic BP (-1.9 +/- 1.0 mmHg, P = 0.036), and PP (-3.3 +/- 1.0 mmHg, P = 0.007) in E + L than M + I. Central office systolic BP (-5.56 +/- 1.9 mmHg, P = 0.009), forward pressure height of the pulse wave (-2.0 +/- 0.9 mmHg, P = 0.028), 24-h ambulatory central systolic (-3.6 +/- 1.4 mmHg, P = 0.045), diastolic BP (-1.95 +/- 1.1 mmHg, P = 0.041), and 24-h pulse wave velocity (-0.14 +/- 0.05m/s, P = 0.043) were reduced to a greater extent with E + L.

   CONCLUSION: Beyond the effects on glycaemic control, the combination therapy of E + L significantly improved central BP and vascular function compared with the classic combination of M + I.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of thrice daily Biphasic Human Insulin 30 (BHI 30) versus the traditional twice-daily regimen in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients. It's a cross over single clinical study. Twenty-two diabetic patients who were already using BHI 30 in twice or thrice daily regimens with or without metformin were included. At the 1st interval; patients continued on their usual insulin regimen as twice or thrice daily injections with adjustment of insulin doses guided by their glucose readings. On the 2nd interval; patients were switched to the other regimen with the same total daily insulin dose redistributed.

   RESULTS: There was a significant decrease in HbA1c level (p < 0.05) at the end of the first 3 months of trial regardless on which regimen the patient started, but there was no significant difference in the mean HbA1c reduction in patients when they were on twice daily insulin injections (1.1 +/- 1.3) versus the time they were on thrice daily insulin injections (0.8 +/- 1.71), p > 0.05. On the other hand, patients had lower average blood glucose readings (mg/dl) when they were on thrice daily insulin injections (161.4 +/- 62.7) compared to twice daily regimen (166.0 +/- 69.5), p < 0.05.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To examine diabetes remission following a short-term intensive metabolic intervention combining lifestyle and glucose-lowering approaches.

   METHODS: We conducted an open-label, randomized controlled trial in 154 patients with type 2 diabetes up to 8 years in duration on 0 to 2 glucose-lowering medications. Participants were randomized to (a) a 12-week intensive intervention comprising lifestyle approaches and treatment with insulin glargine, metformin, and dapagliflozin or (b) standard diabetes care. At 12 weeks, diabetes medications were discontinued in participants with hemoglobin A1c (HbA1C) < 7.3% (56 mmol/mol). Participants were then followed for diabetes relapse until 64 weeks. The primary outcome was complete or partial diabetes remission (HbA1C < 6.5% [48 mmol/mol] off chronic diabetes drugs) at 24 weeks. Main secondary outcomes were complete or partial diabetes remission at 36, 48, and 64 weeks.

   RESULTS: The primary outcome was achieved in 19 (24.7%) intervention group participants and 13 (16.9%) control group participants at 24 weeks (relative risk [RR] 1.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.8-2.7). The relative risks of remission at 36, 48, and 64 weeks were 2.4 (95% CI, 1.2-5.0), 2.1 (95% CI, 1.0-4.4), and 1.8 (95% CI, 0.7-4.7), respectively. In an exploratory analysis, the intervention reduced the hazard of diabetes relapse with overt hyperglycemia by 43% (hazard ratio 0.57; 95% CI, 0.39-0.81).

   CONCLUSIONS: Our primary outcome of diabetes remission at 24 weeks was not statistically significantly different. However, our overall results suggest that some patients with early type 2 diabetes are able to achieve sustained diabetes remission following a short-term intensive intervention. Further studies are needed to optimize the combined therapeutic approach used. Copyright © Endocrine Society 2020. All rights reserved. For permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com.

Abstract
  Achieving adequate glycemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) remains a difficult but achievable goal. Oral agents (OADs) are important option for management of T2DM. Most T2DM patients require more than one medication for adequate glycemic control. Metformin based combination therapy is recommended when monotherapy is insufficient. Evogliptin is a recently developed dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, which can to be combined with metformin for treating T2DM. Combination therapy of Evogliptin and Metformin lowers blood glucose via augmentation of insulin secretion, suppression of glucagon secretion, and insulin sensitization. Co-administration of Evogliptin and Metformin showed no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic differences compared to the administration of each drug alone. Combination therapy of Evogliptin and Metformin also provides significantly better glycemic control compared to the respective monotherapies. Efficacy and safety of Evogliptin and Metformin had been demonstrated in several multicentre randomized clinical trials conducted in various countries like South Korea, Russia and India. Consequently, fixed dose combination (FDC) of Evogliptin and Metformin is approved in South Korea and India. Complexity of the treatment regimen and polypharmacy are well-known factors of poor medication adherence and FDCs have the potential to improve adherence by reducing the pill burden. Adoption of this combination therapy in clinical practice for management of T2DMs will provide a greater degree of HbA1c reduction than that observed with the use of either drug as monotherapy, and is unlikely to cause significant hypoglycemia. Combination therapy of Evogliptin and Metformin is a promising strategy in the treatment of T2DM. Copyright © Journal of the Association of Physicians of India 2011.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrine disorder that affects 8-13% of reproductive-age women. Irregular periods, hirsutism, or infertility are the most common clinical presentations of patients affected by PCOS. This syndrome is also linked to metabolic abnormalities such as type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance and obesity. The optimal therapeutic approach is still unknown.

   AREAS COVERED: This narrative review offers an overview of the literature on current and experimental pharmacological options for treating PCOS and highlights ongoing clinical trials. Several electronic databases were searched and current research registers were analyzed to the present year. The papers selected for this review were critically analyzed, and all data available were summarized, organized, and explored to derive key information.

   EXPERT OPINION: The main goal of PCOS treatment is to obtain a metabolic and hormonal balance. Optimal PCOS therapy should be direct to the reproductive abnormalities and the entire spectrum of endocrine and metabolic complications that appear to have a long-term negative impact on PCOS patient health, as in post-menopausal period. The discovery of new mechanisms in PCOS pathogenesis will offer the possibility of testing new drug classes.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: The lipid profile represents a driver of cardiovascular risk in type 2 diabetes. The effect of chronic insulin therapy on cholesterol levels is unclear. We aim to evaluate the effect of basal insulin on lipid profile compared to other classes of antihyperglycemic agents in type 2 diabetic patients.

   DESIGN: We performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials reporting changes of lipid parameters in type 2 diabetic patients randomly assigned to basal insulin or other classes of anti-hyperglycemic agents.

   RESULTS: The levels of total (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) appeared to be significantly reduced by therapies with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) in comparison to basal insulin (mean difference [MD] -3.80; 95% CI [-6.30 to -1.30] mg/dL, P < .001 and -4.17; 95% CI [-6.04 to -2.30] mg/dL, P < .0001), whereas no difference was detected between basal insulin and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4-I) or standard therapy (sulfonylurea +/- metformin). Thiazolidinediones (TZD) produced a significant improvement in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (MD 3.55; 95% CI: 0.55 to 6.56 mg/dL, P = .02) but were associated with an increase in TC and LDL-C (MD 16.20; 95% CI: 9.09 to 23.31 mg/dL, P < .001 and 5.19: 95% CI: -3.00 to 13.39 mg/dL, P = .21). Basal insulin was superior to standard therapy in triglyceride reduction (MD 3.8; 95% CI: 0.99 to 6.63 mg/dL, P = .008).

   CONCLUSIONS: GLP-1RA were superior to basal insulin in the control of TC and LDL-C. Basal insulin effectively reduced serum triglycerides. TZD led to improvement in HDL-C. DPP4-I and standard therapy did not have any significant effect on lipid levels. Copyright © Endocrine Society 2020. All rights reserved. For permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVES: Electronic health records (EHR) provide a valuable resource for assessing drug side-effects, but treatments are not randomly allocated in routine care creating the potential for bias. We conduct a case study using the Prior Event Rate Ratio (PERR) Pairwise method to reduce unmeasured confounding bias in side-effect estimates for two second-line therapies for type 2 diabetes, thiazolidinediones, and sulfonylureas.

   STUDY DESIGN AND SETTINGS: Primary care data were extracted from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (n = 41,871). We utilized outcomes from the period when patients took first-line metformin to adjust for unmeasured confounding. Estimates for known side-effects and a negative control outcome were compared with the A Diabetes Outcome Progression Trial (ADOPT) trial (n = 2,545).

   RESULTS: When on metformin, patients later prescribed thiazolidinediones had greater risks of edema, HR 95% CI 1.38 (1.13, 1.68) and gastrointestinal side-effects (GI) 1.47 (1.28, 1.68), suggesting the presence of unmeasured confounding. Conventional Cox regression overestimated the risk of edema on thiazolidinediones and identified a false association with GI. The PERR Pairwise estimates were consistent with ADOPT: 1.43 (1.10, 1.83) vs. 1.39 (1.04, 1.86), respectively, for edema, and 0.91 (0.79, 1.05) vs. 0.94 (0.80, 1.10) for GI.

   CONCLUSION: The PERR Pairwise approach offers potential for enhancing postmarketing surveillance of side-effects from EHRs but requires careful consideration of assumptions. Copyright © 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Older patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have an increased risk of bone fracture independent of their bone mineral density (BMD), which is explained mainly by the deteriorated bone quality in T2DM compared to that in non-diabetic adults. Sodium-glucose co-transporter (SGLT) 2 inhibitors have been studied in several trials in T2DM, and the Canagliflozin Cardiovascular Assessment Study showed an increased fracture risk related to treatment with the SGLT2 inhibitor canagliflozin, although no evidence of increased fracture risk with treatment with other SGLT2 inhibitors has been reported. The mechanism of the difference in the fracture risk between the SGLT2 inhibitors is unknown, but the differences among the SGLT2 inhibitors in the selectivity of SGLT2 against SGLT1 may affect bone metabolism, since among the SGLT2 inhibitors the selectivity of canagliflozin is lowest. We will investigate whether the SGLT2 inhibitor luseogliflozin, which has the higher SGLT2 selectivity, affects bone metabolism by using high-resolution, peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) which provides direct in vivo morphometric information about the bone microarchitecture.

   METHODS/DESIGN: This is a single-center, randomized, open-label, active-controlled, parallel pilot trial. Eligible participants are older (age >= 60 years) individuals with T2DM with HbA1c levels at 7.0-8.9%. A total of 24 participants will be allocated to either the luseogliflozin group (taking luseogliflozin) or the control group (taking metformin) in a 1:1 ratio to compare the groups' changes in bone microarchitecture of the radius and tibia which are analyzed by HR-pQCT before and at 48 weeks after the administration of each medication. The laboratory data associated with glycemic control and bone metabolism will be collected every 12 weeks during the study. Recruitment began in June 2019.

   DISCUSSION: The reason that we use metformin as an active control is to avoid yielding differences in glycemic control between the luseogliflozin and control groups. Besides, metformin is considered to have a neutral effect on bone. This trial should reveal the effect of luseogliflozin on bone metabolism in older patients with T2DM.

   TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered with the University Hospital Medical Information Network (UMIN000036202) on 1 April 2019 and with the Japan Registry of Clinicla Trials (jRCTs071180061) on 14 March 2019.

Abstract
  PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of metformin as a treatment for the mortality of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

   METHODS: We searched Medline, PubMed, EMBASE, Clinical Trials.gov (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov), and the Cochrane Collaboration Library from inception to November 2019. To analyze the relationship between metformin and the overall mortality, specific mortality, and sex differences in CRC patients with T2DM, hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used. Egger's test and Begg's test were used to assess publication bias.

   RESULTS: We included 8 cohort studies in our meta-analysis. CRC patients with T2DM treated with metformin had a lower overall mortality than CRC patients with T2DM who did not receive metformin (HR = 0.80, 95% CI 0.67-0.95). There was no significant difference in CRC-specific mortality between CRC patients with T2DM who used metformin and those who did not (HR = 0.84, 95% CI 0.65-1.08). However, females had a lower CRC-specific mortality among CRC patients with T2DM than males (HR = 0.63, 95% CI 0.41-0.97).

   CONCLUSION: Metformin reduced the overall mortality of CRC patients with T2DM. Moreover, female CRC patients with T2DM using metformin had lower CRC-specific mortality than male CRC patients with T2DM.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: The way that GP practices organize their services impacts as much on glycaemia in type 2 diabetes as does prescribing.

   AIM: Our aim was to evaluate the link between patients' own perception of support within primary care and the % patients at each GP practice at target glycaemic control (TGC) and at high glycaemic risk (HGR).

   DESIGN AND SETTING: Utilisation of National Diabetes Audit (NDA) available data combined with the General practitioner patient survey (GPPS).

   METHOD: The NDA 2016_17 published data on numbers of type 2 patients, levels of local diabetes services and the target glycaemic control (TGC) % and high glycaemic risk (HGR) % achieved. The GPPS 2017 published % "No" responses from long term condition (LTC) patients to the question "In the last 6 months, had you enough support from local services or organisations to help manage LTCs?". Multivariate regression was used on the set of indicators capturing patients' demographics and services provided.

   RESULTS: 6498 practices were included (with more than 2.5 million T2DM patients) and median values with band limits that included 95% practices for % "No" response to the question above was 12% (2%-30%), for TGC 67% (54%-78%) and for HGR 6% (2%-13%). The model accounted for 25% TGC variance and 26% HGR variance. The standardised beta values shown as (TGC/HGR) (+=more people; -=less people) for older age (+0.24/-0.25), sulphonylurea use (-0.21/+0.14), greater social disadvantage (-0.09/+0.21), GPPS Support %No (-0.08/+0.12), %Completion 8 checks (+0.09/-0.12) and metformin use (+0.11/-0.05).

   CONCLUSION: The relation between the person with diabetes and clinician in primary care is shown to be quantitatively potentially as important in influencing glycaemic outcome as the services provided and medication prescribed. We suggest that all of us in who work in the health care system can bear this in mind in our everyday work. Copyright © 2019 Primary Care Diabetes Europe. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract
  Despite the known heterogeneity of type 2 diabetes and variable response to glucose lowering medications, current evidence on optimal treatment is predominantly based on average effects in clinical trials rather than individual-level characteristics. A precision medicine approach based on treatment response would aim to improve on this by identifying predictors of differential drug response for people based on their characteristics and then using this information to select optimal treatment. Recent research has demonstrated robust and clinically relevant differential drug response with all noninsulin treatments after metformin (sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 [DPP-4] inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide 1 [GLP-1] receptor agonists, and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 [SGLT2] inhibitors) using routinely available clinical features. This Perspective reviews this current evidence and discusses how differences in drug response could inform selection of optimal type 2 diabetes treatment in the near future. It presents a novel framework for developing and testing precision medicine-based strategies to optimize treatment, harnessing existing routine clinical and trial data sources. This framework was recently applied to demonstrate that "subtype" approaches, in which people are classified into subgroups based on features reflecting underlying pathophysiology, are likely to have less clinical utility compared with approaches that combine the same features as continuous measures in probabilistic "individualized prediction" models.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Metformin is the most commonly used antidiabetic drug with a plethora of proven metabolic and cardiovascular beneficial effects and exceptional safety profile. On top of the established metabolic effects, retrospective epidemiologic evidence shows that metformin use is associated with decreased cancer risk and/or improved disease prognosis in diabetic cancer patients on metformin compared to those treated with different antidiabetic drugs. This is a sound argument for eventual repurposing metformin as an adjuvant drug in oncology; however, evidence-based data are currently needed to establish this. Metformin is a biguanide that in the context of type 2 diabetes primarily targets the liver. Metformin inhibits oxidative phosphorylation which leads to the suppression of gluconeogenesis and causes decrease of blood glucose concentration. Mechanisms responsible for metformin anti-neoplastic effect have been investigated extensively, and key events seem to centralize around its ability to induce intracellular energetic stress with subsequent changes of metabolism resulting in cytostatic or cytotoxic action. Large clinical experience with metformin in the treatment of diabetes together with its plausible effects on different cancer cell types initiated a number of clinical trials that tested the hypothesis that metformin might have a beneficial effect in the treatment of cancer.

   PURPOSE: The aim of this review is to compile recent advances in our understanding of metformin antineoplastic effects and to give a summary of the results of recent clinical trials of metformin for treatment of different cancer types.

Abstract
  Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has emerged as the leading liver disease globally. NAFLD patients can have a progressive phenotype, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) that could lead to cirrhosis, liver failure and cancer. There is a close bi-directional relationship between NAFLD and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM); NAFLD increases the risk for T2DM and its complications whereas T2DM increases the severity of NAFLD and its complications. The large global impact of NAFLD and T2DM on healthcare systems requires a paradigm shift from specialty care to early identification and risk stratification of NAFLD in primary care and diabetes clinics. Approach to diagnosis, risk stratification and management of NAFLD is discussed. In addition to optimizing the control of coexisting cardiometabolic comorbidities, early referral of NAFLD patients at high risk of having NASH or significant fibrosis to hepatology specialist care may improve management and allow access for clinical trials. Lifestyle modifications, vitamin E, pioglitazone and metformin are currently available options that may benefit patients with T2DM and NAFLD. The burst of clinical trials investigating newer therapeutic agents for NAFLD and NASH offer hope for new, effective and safe therapies in the near future.

Abstract
  The risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) (myocardial infarction, stroke, peripheral vascular disease) is twice in type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients compared to non-diabetic subjects. Furthermore, cardiovascular disease (CV) is the leading cause of death in patients with T2D. In the last years several clinical intervention studies with new anti-hyperglycaemic drugs have been published, and they have shown a positive effect on the reduction of mortality and cardiovascular risk in T2D patients. In particular, these studies evaluated sodium/glucose-2 cotransporter inhibitors (SGLT2i) and Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA). In secondary prevention, it was clearly demonstrated that SGLT2i and GLP-1RA drugs reduce CV events and mortality, and new guidelines consider now these drugs as first choice (after metformin) in the treatment of T2D; there are also some signs that they may be effective also in primary prevention of CVD. However, the mechanisms involved in cardiovascular protection are not yet fully understood, but they appear to be both "glycaemic" and "extra-glycaemic". In this review, we will examine the fundamental results of the clinical trials on SGLT2i and GLP-1RA, their clinical relevance in term of treatment of T2D, and we will discuss the mechanisms that may explain how these drugs exert their cardiovascular protective effects.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Recent reports suggest that the negative association between diabetes mellitus and abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) may be driven by metformin, the world's most common antidiabetic drug rather than diabetes per se. We sought to investigate the association among AAA growth rate, chemokine profile, and metformin prescription in a contemporary Swedish cohort.

   METHODS: Patients under surveillance for small AAA were identified at 4 Swedish vascular centers with active AAA screening programs. Annual AAA growth rate, medical history, and prescribed medications were recorded for linear regression analysis. In a subset of patients with AAA and control subjects without AAA or diabetes, plasma samples were available and analyzed for 40 inflammatory chemokines.

   RESULTS: A total of 526 patients were included for AAA growth analysis: 428 without type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), 65 with T2DM and metformin prescription, and 33 with T2DM but without metformin prescription. Patients were included from 2005 to 2017 with mean follow-up of 3.2 (1.7) years and median annual AAA growth rate 1.6 mm, range -4.8 to 15.4 mm. Mean (standard deviation) annual AAA growth rates were 2.3 (2.2) mm in non-T2DM patients versus 1.1 (1.1) mm in patients with T2DM with metformin prescription and 1.6 (1.4) mm among those with T2DM without metformin prescription. With non-T2DM patients as reference in an unadjusted and 2 adjusted models, metformin prescription was significantly associated with reduced AAA growth rate (P < 0.001, P = 0.005, and P = 0.024, respectively), but not T2DM without metformin prescription (P = 0.137, P = 0.331, and P = 0.479, respectively). Among 240 patients with AAA (152 without T2DM, 51 with T2DM and metformin, and 37 with T2DM without metformin) and 59 without AAA or T2DM, metformin prescription was associated with reduced expression of chemokines representing all classes of leukocytes.

   CONCLUSIONS: Metformin prescription is associated with reduced AAA growth rate, possibly mediated by broad anti-inflammatory effects. A randomized controlled trial is needed to determine what role metformin may play in AAA disease, particularly in the absence of T2DM. Copyright © 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain the most identified cause of death in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). This study aimed to evaluate the effect of adding Vildagliptin versus Glimepiride to ongoing Metformin on the biomarkers of inflammation, thrombosis, and atherosclerosis in T2DM patients with symptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD).

   METHODS: This study included 80 patients with uncontrolled T2DM and symptomatic CAD who were randomized to add either Vildagliptin 50 mg/day "group I" or Glimepiride 4 mg/day "group II" to ongoing Metformin therapy (1000 mg/day). Blood samples were collected at baseline and 3 months after intervention for biochemical analysis of HbA1c %, IL-1beta, adiponectin, hsCRP and lipid profile. Additionally atherogenic index (AI) and coronary risk index (CRI) were determined.

   RESULTS: Three months after intervention and as compared to group II (Glimepiride/Metformin), group 1 (Vildagliptin/Metformin) showed significantly lower BMI (28.73 +/- 3.48 versus 30.55 +/- 3.15; p = 0.02), HbA1c (6.05 +/- 0.72 versus 7.06 +/- 0.89; p < 0.0001), hsCRP (0.96 +/- 0.20 versus 1.72 +/- 0.38; p < 0.0001), IL-1beta (34.95 +/- 10.01 versus 45.13 +/- 10.26; p < 0.0001), TC (136 +/- 23.45 versus 169 +/- 35.72; p < 0.0001), TG (116 +/- 29.10 versus 146 +/- 56.58; p = 0.005), and CRI (2.47 +/- 0.90 versus 3.65 +/- 1.19; p < 0.0001) which was associated with significantly higher adiponectin and HDL-C (4.42 +/- 1.29 versus 2.52 +/- 1.86; p < 0.0001 and 61 +/- 23.04 versus 48 +/- 12.92; p = 0.003 respectively).

   CONCLUSION: In patients with T2DM and symptomatic CAD, the addition of Vildagliptin to ongoing metformin showed better glycemic control, lower inflammatory markers (IL-1beta and hsCRP), higher protective markers (adiponectin and HDL-C) and improved lipid profile compared to Glimepiride/metformin therapy.

Abstract
  AIMS: The CV-CARE registry provides RWE in Canadian routine clinical practice.

   METHODS: CV-CARE is a multi-site, observational, prospective Canadian registry enrolling patients initiating treatment with metformin hydrochloride extended-release (MetER) for T2D; colesevelam (C) for HCh; and azilsartan (AZI), azilsartan/chlorthalidone (AZI/CHL) or diltiazem extended-release (TXC) for HTN. Patient characteristics/assessment were performed at baseline and 12 +/- 6 months. Primary outcome was absolute change in HbA1c and FPG (MetER); % change in LDL-C (C); and absolute change in BP (AZI-AZI/CHL-TXC).

   RESULTS: Of the 4194 patients in the primary analysis population, 24% were taking MetER, 39% were taking C, 33% were taking AZI, 12% were taking AZI/CHL, and 3% were taking TXC. At 12 months, MetER-treated patients had an absolute mean (95% CI) change in HbA1c of -0.3% [-0.4; -0.2] and in FPG of 0.7 mmol/L [-1.0; -0.4]. C-treated patients had a mean (95% CI) % change in LDL-C of -13.0% [-14.6; -11.4]. Absolute mean (95% CI) changes in SBP were -18.7 mmHg [-19.7; -17.7](AZI), -21.3 mmHg [-23.1; -19.5](AZI/CHL), and -12.3 mmHg [-15.1; -9.6](TXC).

   CONCLUSION: In a real-world Canadian setting, MetER, C, AZI, AZI/CHL, and TXC show improvement of the cardiometabolic profile of T2D, HCh, and HTN patients. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus is closely related to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease(NAFLD). More and more attention has been paid to the efficacy of liraglutide in the treatment of NAFLD, but the clinical evidence is still insufficient.

   OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to use proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-MRS) assessment of metformin alone poor blood glucose control of obese patients type 2 diabetes with NAFLD, added with insulin glargine, liraglutide or placebo effect in improving the fatty liver.

   METHODS: This is a 26-week, single-center, prospective, randomized placebo-controlled study. From September 2016 to July 2018, 128 patients with type 2 diabetes and NAFLD were enrolled in the China joint logistics team 900 hospital. The primary endpoints were the changes in intrahepatic content of lipid (IHCL), abdominal adiposity [subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT)], from baseline to week 26 (end of treatment) and the changes in liraglutide group or insulin glargine group versus change in placebo group. Secondary endpoints included the changes in liver function (AST and ALT), glycemia (HbA1c and FPG), body weight, and BMI.

   RESULTS: A total of 96 patients with type 2 diabetes and NAFLD under inadequate glycemic control by metformin were randomized (1:1:1) to receive add-on insulin glargine, liraglutide, or placebo. After 26 weeks of treatment, compared to the placebo group, in the liraglutide and insulin glargine groups, IHCL significantly decreased from baseline to week 26 (liraglutide 26.4% +/- 3.2% to 20.6% +/- 3.9%, P < 0.05; insulin glargine 25.0% +/- 4.3% to 22.6% +/- 5.8%, P > 0.05). SAT and VAT decreased significantly in the liraglutide group and in the insulin glargine group (P < 0.05). DELTASAT and DELTAVAT were greater with liraglutide than insulin glargine, they were significantly different between the two groups (DELTASAT, -36 vs. - 24.5, P < 0.05; and DELTAVAT, -47 vs. - 16.6, P > 0.05). In the liraglutide group, AST, ALT, and HOMA-IR decreased significantly from baseline. There was no significant difference in glucose-lowering among the three groups. During the treatment, the safety of the three groups performed well.

   CONCLUSION: Compared with placebo, treatment with liraglutide plus an adequate dose of metformin (2000 g/ day) for 26 weeks is more effective in reducing IHCL, SAT and VAT in patients with type 2 diabetes and NAFLD. And it has additional advantages in weight loss, waist circumference reduction and liver function improvement. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  AIMS: To assess the methodological quality of the systematic reviews of the literature for Good Practice Guidelines (GPGs) for treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D).

   METHODS: The GPGs on treatment of T2D from May 2012 onwards were searched on PubMed, the Guidelines International Network, the National Guidelines Clearing House and the Infobanque des guides de pratique clinique. Quality of the GPGs was assessed by means of grading of levels of evidence, strength of recommendations, statements pertaining to systematic reviews, description of their methods, search for Randomized Controlled Trials meta-analyses, and citations from three meta-analyses which contested the strategy of intensive glycemic control and metformin as first-line treatment.

   RESULTS: Fiflty-two GPGs were included; half of them had and applied a system of grading and strength of recommendation and 58% stated they had carried out a systematic review. Only one GPG cited the three meta-analyses. Three quarters of the GPGs failed to detail their bibliographic research methods.

   CONCLUSION: The GPGs for treatment of T2D were of poor quality and their methodological rigor was insufficient. Even though the meta-analyses had a higher level of evidence, they were seldom cited. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Metformin is the first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), but many patients either cannot tolerate it or cannot achieve glycemic control with metformin alone, so treatment with other glucose-lowering agents in combination with metformin is frequently required. Remogliflozin etabonate, a novel agent, is an orally bioavailable prodrug of remogliflozin, which is a potent and selective sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor.

   OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of remogliflozin etabonate compared with dapagliflozin in subjects with T2DM in whom a stable dose of metformin as monotherapy was providing inadequate glycemic control.

   METHODS: A 24-week randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled, three-arm, parallel-group, multicenter, phase III study was conducted in India. Patients aged >= 18 and <= 65 years diagnosed with T2DM, receiving metformin >= 1500 mg/day, and with glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels >= 7 to <= 10% at screening were randomized into three groups. Every patient received metformin >= 1500 mg and either remogliflozin etabonate 100 mg twice daily (BID) (group 1, n = 225) or remogliflozin etabonate 250 mg BID (group 2, n = 241) or dapagliflozin 10 mg once daily (QD) in the morning and placebo QD in the evening (group 3, n = 146). The patients were followed-up at weeks 1 and 4 and at 4-week intervals thereafter until week 24. The endpoints included mean change in HbA1c (primary endpoint, noninferiority margin = 0.35), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), postprandial plasma glucose (PPG), bodyweight, blood pressure, and fasting lipids. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), safety laboratory values, electrocardiogram, and vital signs were evaluated.

   RESULTS: Of 612 randomized patients, 167 (group 1), 175 (group 2), and 103 (group 3) patients with comparable baseline characteristics completed the study. Mean change +/- standard error (SE) in HbA1c from baseline to week 24 was - 0.72 +/- 0.09, - 0.77 +/- 0.09, and - 0.58 +/- 0.12% in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The difference in mean HbA1c of group 1 versus group 3 (- 0.14%, 90% confidence interval [CI] - 0.38 to 0.10) and group 2 versus group 3 (- 0.19%; 90% CI - 0.42 to 0.05) was noninferior to that in group 3 (p < 0.001). No significant difference was found between group 1 or group 2 and group 3 in change in FPG, PPG, and bodyweight. The overall incidence of TEAEs was comparable across study groups (group 1 = 32.6%, group 2 = 34.4%, group 3 = 29.5%), including adverse events (AEs) of special interest (hypoglycemic events, urinary tract infection, genital fungal infection). Most TEAEs were mild to moderate in intensity, and no severe AEs were reported.

   CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated the noninferiority of remogliflozin etabonate 100 and 250 mg compared with dapagliflozin, from the first analysis of an initial 612 patients. Remogliflozin etabonate therefore may be considered an effective and well-tolerated alternative treatment option for glycemic control in T2DM.

Abstract
  Growing evidence indicates that oxidative and endoplasmic reticular stress, which trigger changes in ion channels and inflammatory pathways that may undermine cellular homeostasis and survival, are critical determinants of injury in the diabetic kidney. Cells are normally able to mitigate these cellular stresses by maintaining high levels of autophagy, an intracellular lysosome-dependent degradative pathway that clears the cytoplasm of dysfunctional organelles. However, the capacity for autophagy in both podocytes and renal tubular cells is markedly impaired in type 2 diabetes, and this deficiency contributes importantly to the intensity of renal injury. The primary drivers of autophagy in states of nutrient and oxygen deprivation-sirtuin-1 (SIRT1), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha)-can exert renoprotective effects by promoting autophagic flux and by exerting direct effects on sodium transport and inflammasome activation. Type 2 diabetes is characterized by marked suppression of SIRT1 and AMPK, leading to a diminution in autophagic flux in glomerular podocytes and renal tubules and markedly increasing their susceptibility to renal injury. Importantly, because insulin acts to depress autophagic flux, these derangements in nutrient deprivation signaling are not ameliorated by antihyperglycemic drugs that enhance insulin secretion or signaling. Metformin is an established AMPK agonist that can promote autophagy, but its effects on the course of CKD have been demonstrated only in the experimental setting. In contrast, the effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors may be related primarily to enhanced SIRT1 and HIF-2alpha signaling; this can explain the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors to promote ketonemia and erythrocytosis and potentially underlies their actions to increase autophagy and mute inflammation in the diabetic kidney. These distinctions may contribute importantly to the consistent benefit of SGLT2 inhibitors to slow the deterioration in glomerular function and reduce the risk of ESKD in large-scale randomized clinical trials of patients with type 2 diabetes.

Abstract
  Importance: A stepwise approach that includes screening and lifestyle modification followed by the addition of metformin for individuals with high risk of diabetes is recommended to delay progression to diabetes; however, there is scant evidence regarding whether this approach is cost-effective.

   Objective: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of a stepwise approach in the Diabetes Community Lifestyle Improvement Program.

   Design, Setting, and Participants: This economic evaluation study included 578 adults with impaired glucose tolerance, impaired fasting glucose, or both. Participants were enrolled in the Diabetes Community Lifestyle Improvement Program, a randomized clinical trial with 3-year follow-up conducted at a diabetes care and research center in Chennai, India.

   Interventions: The intervention group underwent a 6-month lifestyle modification curriculum plus stepwise addition of metformin; the control group received standard lifestyle advice.

   Main Outcomes and Measures: Cost, health benefits, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were estimated from multipayer (including direct medical costs) and societal (including direct medical and nonmedical costs) perspectives. Costs and ICERs were reported in 2019 Indian rupees (INR) and purchasing power parity-adjusted international dollars (INT $).

   Results: The mean (SD) age of the 578 participants was 44.4 (9.3) years, and 364 (63.2%) were men. Mean (SD) body mass index was 27.9 (3.7), and the mean (SD) glycated hemoglobin level was 6.0% (0.5). Implementing lifestyle modification and metformin was associated with INR 10549 (95% CI, INR 10134-10964) (INT $803 [95% CI, INT $771-834]) higher direct costs; INR 5194 (95% CI, INR 3187-INR 7201) (INT $395; 95% CI, INT $65-147) higher direct nonmedical costs, an absolute diabetes risk reduction of 10.2% (95% CI, 1.9% to 18.5%), and an incremental gain of 0.099 (95% CI, 0.018 to 0.179) quality-adjusted life-years per participant. From a multipayer perspective (including screening costs), mean ICERs were INR 1912 (INT $145) per 1 percentage point diabetes risk reduction, INR 191090 (INT $14539) per diabetes case prevented and/or delayed, and INR 196960 (INT $14986) per quality-adjusted life-year gained. In the scenario of a 50% increase or decrease in screening and intervention costs, the mean ICERs varied from INR 855 (INT $65) to INR 2968 (INT $226) per 1 percentage point diabetes risk reduction, from INR 85495 (INT $6505) to INR 296681 (INT $22574) per diabetes case prevented, and from INR 88121 (INT $6705) to INR 305798 (INT $23267) per quality-adjusted life-year gained.

   Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of this study suggest that a stepwise approach for diabetes prevention is likely to be cost-effective, even if screening costs for identifying high-risk individuals are added.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: The term prediabetes is used to describe a population with an elevated risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). With projections of an increase in the incidence of T2DM, prevention or delay of the disease and its complications is paramount. It is currently unknown whether pioglitazone is beneficial in the treatment of people with increased risk of developing T2DM.

   OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of pioglitazone for prevention or delay of T2DM and its associated complications in people at risk of developing T2DM.

   SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Chinese databases, ICTRP Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. We did not apply any language restrictions. Further, we investigated the reference lists of all included studies and reviews. We tried to contact all study authors. The date of the last search of databases was November 2019 (March 2020 for Chinese databases).

   SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a minimum duration of 24 weeks, and participants diagnosed with intermediate hyperglycaemia with no concomitant diseases, comparing pioglitazone as monotherapy or part of dual therapy with other glucose-lowering drugs, behaviour-changing interventions, placebo or no intervention.

   DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently screened abstracts, read full-text articles and records, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We performed meta-analyses with a random-effects model and calculated risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for effect estimates. We evaluated the certainty of the evidence with the GRADE.

   MAIN RESULTS: We included 27 studies with a total of 4186 randomised participants. The size of individual studies ranged between 43 and 605 participants and the duration varied between 6 and 36 months. We judged none of the included studies as having low risk of bias across all 'Risk of bias' domains. Most studies identified people at increased risk of T2DM by impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), or both. Our main outcome measures were all-cause mortality, incidence of T2DM, serious adverse events (SAEs), cardiovascular mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction or stroke (NMI/S), health-related quality of life (QoL) and socioeconomic effects. The following comparisons mostly reported only a fraction of our main outcome set. Three studies compared pioglitazone with metformin. They did not report all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, NMI/S, QoL or socioeconomic effects. Incidence of T2DM was 9/168 participants in the pioglitazone groups versus 9/163 participants in the metformin groups (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.40 to 2.38; P = 0.96; 3 studies, 331 participants; low-certainty evidence). No SAEs were reported in two studies (201 participants; low-certainty evidence). One study compared pioglitazone with acarbose. Incidence of T2DM was 1/50 participants in the pioglitazone group versus 2/46 participants in the acarbose group (very low-certainty evidence). No participant experienced a SAE (very low-certainty evidence). One study compared pioglitazone with repaglinide. Incidence of T2DM was 2/48 participants in the pioglitazone group versus 1/48 participants in the repaglinide group (low-certainty evidence). No participant experienced a SAE (low-certainty evidence). One study compared pioglitazone with a personalised diet and exercise consultation. All-cause and cardiovascular mortality, NMI/S, QoL or socioeconomic effects were not reported. Incidence of T2DM was 2/48 participants in the pioglitazone group versus 5/48 participants in the diet and exercise consultation group (low-certainty evidence). No participant experienced a SAE (low-certainty evidence). Six studies compared pioglitazone with placebo. No study reported on QoL or socioeconomic effects. All-cause mortality was 5/577 participants the in the pioglitazone groups versus 2/579 participants in the placebo groups (Peto odds ratio 2.38, 95% CI 0.54 to 10.50; P = 0.25; 4 studies, 1156 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Incidence of T2DM was 80/700 participants in the pioglitazone groups versus 131/695 participants in the placebo groups (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.95; P = 0.04; 6 studies, 1395 participants; low-certainty evidence). There were 3/93 participants with SAEs in the pioglitazone groups versus 1/94 participants in the placebo groups (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.32 to 28.22; P = 0.34; 2 studies, 187 participants; very low-certainty evidence). However, the largest study for this comparison did not distinguish between serious and non-serious adverse events. This study reported that 121/303 (39.9%) participants in the pioglitazone group versus 151/299 (50.5%) participants in the placebo group experienced an adverse event (P = 0.03). One study observed cardiovascular mortality in 2/181 participants in the pioglitazone group versus 0/186 participants in the placebo group (RR 5.14, 95% CI 0.25 to 106.28; P = 0.29; very low-certainty evidence). One study observed NMI in 2/303 participants in the pioglitazone group versus 1/299 participants in the placebo group (RR 1.97: 95% CI 0.18 to 21.65; P = 0.58; very low-certainty evidence). Twenty-one studies compared pioglitazone with no intervention. No study reported on cardiovascular mortality, NMI/S, QoL or socioeconomic effects. All-cause mortality was 11/441 participants in the pioglitazone groups versus 12/425 participants in the no-intervention groups (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.91; P = 0.70; 3 studies, 866 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Incidence of T2DM was 60/1034 participants in the pioglitazone groups versus 197/1019 participants in the no-intervention groups (RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.40; P < 0.001; 16 studies, 2053 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Studies reported SAEs in 16/610 participants in the pioglitazone groups versus 21/601 participants in the no-intervention groups (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.32; P = 0.28; 7 studies, 1211 participants; low-certainty evidence). We identified two ongoing studies, comparing pioglitazone with placebo and with other glucose-lowering drugs. These studies, with 2694 participants. may contribute evidence to future updates of this review.

   AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Pioglitazone reduced or delayed the development of T2DM in people at increased risk of T2DM compared with placebo (low-certainty evidence) and compared with no intervention (moderate-certainty evidence). It is unclear whether the effect of pioglitazone is sustained once discontinued. Pioglitazone compared with metformin neither showed advantage nor disadvantage regarding the development of T2DM in people at increased risk (low-certainty evidence). The data and reporting of all-cause mortality, SAEs, micro- and macrovascular complications were generally sparse. None of the included studies reported on QoL or socioeconomic effects.

Abstract
  As the cornerstone of type 2 diabetes (T2D) management within the community, primary care providers are now faced with the challenge of not only managing diabetes itself, but also preventing hypoglycemia and weight gain associated with intensive disease management, and reducing cardiovascular risk. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) are well established as efficacious treatments for T2D, and the safety/tolerability profile of this drug class is well defined. However, despite their beneficial effects, GLP-1RAs are under-utilized, highlighting the need for novel approaches to increase their use in primary care. Oral semaglutide is the first oral GLP-1RA approved for the treatment of T2D, offering glucose lowering and body weight loss, a low risk of hypoglycemia, and no increase in cardiovascular risk. Oral semaglutide represents an additional treatment option for patients not achieving their glycemic goal despite treatment with metformin, either alone or with other hypoglycemic agents. Oral semaglutide has the potential to increase usage of GLP-1RAs in the primary care setting by addressing clinician and patient concerns about injections, and may facilitate earlier initiation of GLP-1RA therapy in T2D. Due to the formulation of oral semaglutide, clinicians need to be aware of specific considerations in order to ensure optimal use. Such considerations include dosing conditions and use of concomitant medications. This article provides practical guidance on the use of oral semaglutide in the primary care setting, based on evidence from clinical studies, including the phase 3a PIONEER program, and the authors' clinical experience.

Abstract
  Background Randomized controlled trials showed that newer glucose-lowering agents are cardioprotective, but most participants were men. It is unknown whether benefits are similar in women. Methods and Results Among adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus not controlled with metformin with no prior use of insulin, we assessed for sex differences in the cardiovascular effectiveness and safety of sodium-glucose-like transport-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i), glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA), dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, initiated as second-line agents relative to sulfonylureas (reference-group). We studied type 2 diabetes mellitus American adults with newly dispensed sulfonylureas, SGLT-2i, GLP-1RA, or dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (Marketscan-Database: 2011-2017). We used multivariable Cox proportional hazards models with time-varying exposure to compare time to first nonfatal cardiovascular event (myocardial infarction/unstable angina, stroke, and heart failure), and safety outcomes between drugs users, and tested for sex-drug interactions. Among 167 254 type 2 diabetes mellitus metformin users (46% women, median age 59 years, at low cardiovascular risk), during a median 4.5-year follow-up, cardiovascular events incidence was lower in women than men (14.7 versus 16.7 per 1000-person-year). Compared with sulfonylureas, hazard ratios (HRs) for cardiovascular events were lower with GLP-1RA (adjusted HR-women: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.48-0.68; aHR-men: 0.82, 0.71-0.95), dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (aHR-women: 0.83, 0.77-0.89; aHR-men: 0.85, 0.79-0.91) and SGLT-2i (aHR-women: 0.58, 0.46-0.74; aHR-men: 0.69, 0.57-0.83). A sex-by-drug interaction was statistically significant only for GLP-1RA (P=0.002), suggesting greater cardiovascular effectiveness in women. Compared with sulfonylureas, risks of adverse events were similarly lower in both sexes for GLP-1RA (aHR-women: 0.81, 0.73-0.89; aHR-men: 0.80, 0.71-0.89), dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (aHR-women: 0.82, 0.78-0.87; aHR-men: 0.83, 0.78-0.87) and SGLT-2i (aHR-women: 0.68, 0.59-0.78; aHR-men: 0.67, 0.59-0.78) (all sex-drug interactions for adverse events P>0.05). Conclusions Newer glucose-lowering drugs were associated with lower risk of cardiovascular events than sulfonylureas, with greater effectiveness of GLP-1RA in women than men. Overall, they appeared safe, with a better safety profile for SGLT-2i than for GLP-1RA regardless of sex.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: It is thought that a reduction in the frequency of basal insulin injections might facilitate treatment acceptance and adherence among patients with type 2 diabetes. Insulin icodec is a basal insulin analogue designed for once-weekly administration that is in development for the treatment of diabetes.

   METHODS: We conducted a 26-week, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, phase 2 trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of once-weekly insulin icodec as compared with once-daily insulin glargine U100 in patients who had not previously received long-term insulin treatment and whose type 2 diabetes was inadequately controlled (glycated hemoglobin level, 7.0 to 9.5%) while taking metformin with or without a dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor. The primary end point was the change in glycated hemoglobin level from baseline to week 26. Safety end points, including episodes of hypoglycemia and insulin-related adverse events, were also evaluated.

   RESULTS: A total of 247 participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive icodec or glargine. Baseline characteristics were similar in the two groups; the mean baseline glycated hemoglobin level was 8.09% in the icodec group and 7.96% in the glargine group. The estimated mean change from baseline in the glycated hemoglobin level was -1.33 percentage points in the icodec group and -1.15 percentage points in the glargine group, to estimated means of 6.69% and 6.87%, respectively, at week 26; the estimated between-group difference in the change from baseline was -0.18 percentage points (95% CI, -0.38 to 0.02, P = 0.08). The observed rates of hypoglycemia with severity of level 2 (blood glucose level, <54 mg per deciliter) or level 3 (severe cognitive impairment) were low (icodec group, 0.53 events per patient-year; glargine group, 0.46 events per patient-year; estimated rate ratio, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.45 to 2.65). There was no between-group difference in insulin-related key adverse events, and rates of hypersensitivity and injection-site reactions were low. Most adverse events were mild, and no serious events were deemed to be related to the trial medications.

   CONCLUSIONS: Once-weekly treatment with insulin icodec had glucose-lowering efficacy and a safety profile similar to those of once-daily insulin glargine U100 in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Several pharmacologic options for type 2 diabetes are available.

   PURPOSE: To compare benefits and harms of glucose-lowering drugs in adults with type 2 diabetes.

   DATA SOURCES: Several databases from inception through 18 December 2019 and ClinicalTrials.gov on 10 April 2020.

   STUDY SELECTION: English-language randomized trials that had at least 24 weeks of intervention and assessed the effects of glucose-lowering drugs on mortality, glycemic, and vascular outcomes.

   DATA EXTRACTION: Pairs of reviewers extracted data and appraised risk of bias.

   DATA SYNTHESIS: 453 trials assessing 21 antidiabetic interventions from 9 drug classes were included. Interventions included monotherapies (134 trials), add-on to metformin-based therapies (296 trials), and monotherapies versus add-on to metformin therapies (23 trials). There were no differences between treatments in drug-naive patients at low cardiovascular risk. Insulin regimens and specific glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) added to metformin-based background therapy produced the greatest reductions in hemoglobin A1c level. In patients at low cardiovascular risk receiving metformin-based background treatment (298 trials), there were no clinically meaningful differences between treatments for mortality and vascular outcomes. In patients at increased cardiovascular risk receiving metformin-based background treatment (21 trials), oral semaglutide, empagliflozin, liraglutide, extended-release exenatide, and dapagliflozin reduced all-cause mortality. Oral semaglutide, empagliflozin, and liraglutide also reduced cardiovascular death. Odds of stroke were lower with subcutaneous semaglutide and dulaglutide. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors reduced heart failure hospitalization and end-stage renal disease. Subcutaneous semaglutide and canagliflozin increased diabetic retinopathy and amputation, respectively.

   LIMITATION: Inconsistent definitions of cardiovascular risk and low-level confidence in some estimates for patients at low cardiovascular risk.

   CONCLUSION: In diabetic patients at low cardiovascular risk, no treatment differs from placebo for vascular outcomes. In patients at increased cardiovascular risk receiving metformin-based background therapy, specific GLP-1 RAs and SGLT-2 inhibitors have a favorable effect on certain cardiovascular outcomes.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: With the implementation of the Strategy of Health Promotion and Prevention in Spain, the scenario reflected in previous studies of low control of cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF) in patients with type 2 diabetes (DM2) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) can be modified. This study intends to determine the level of blood glucose control and other CVRF in patients with DM2 and CVD currently seen in clinics in Spain, as well as the pattern of antidiabetic treatment, and differences according to gender.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: An epidemiological, observational, cross-sectional, nationwide study was conducted in patients of both genders diagnosed with DM2 and established CVD.

   RESULTS: The study included 3,143 patients with a mean age 69.0+/-10 years. The mean HbA1c was 7.4+/-1.1% in females vs 7.3+/-1.2% in males (P<.05) and systolic blood pressure was 137+/-15.0mmHg in females vs 135.6+/-14.7mmHg in males (P<.05). The mean LDL-cholesterol was 101.5+/-38.1mg/dl in females vs 91.1+/-37.5mg/dl in males; P<.001) and the mean body mass index (30.7+/-5.4kg/m2 in females vs 29.6+/-4.5kg/m2 in males; P<.001). The most used treatments were metformin (68.1%) and/or DPP4 inhibitors (53.7%), with no differences between genders.

   CONCLUSIONS: The level of blood glucose control of DM2 patients with CVD in Spain can be improved. The treatment profile does not conform to the recommendations of clinical practice guidelines in general. The differences in the control of CVRF are worse in women for lipids and obesity.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular safety of dipeptidyl peptidase-IV inhibitors (DPP-4i) in patients without cardiovascular or renal disease, a majority of newly diagnosed patients with type 2 diabetes often excluded from clinical trials on this association, is poorly understood. Thus, we investigate the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) associated with DPP-4i in low-risk patients with diabetes.

   METHODS: Using a new-user retrospective cohort derived from IBM MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters (2010-2015), we identified patients aged 35-65 with type 2 diabetes, without cardiovascular or renal disease, initiating DPP-4i, sulfonylureas, or metformin. Primary composite outcome of time to first MACE was defined as the first of any of the following: myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, coronary artery bypass graft, coronary angioplasty, heart failure, and stroke. Secondary outcomes were time to first heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, and stroke. We compared outcomes for DPP-4i versus sulfonylurea and DPP-4i versus metformin using propensity score weighted Cox proportional hazards, adjusting for demographics, baseline comorbidities, concomitant medications, and cumulative exposure.

   RESULTS: Of 445,701 individuals, 236,431 (53.0%) were male, median age was 51 (interquartile range: [44, 57]), 30,267 (6.79%) initiated DPP-4i, 52,138 (11.70%) initiated sulfonylureas, and 367,908 (82.55%) initiated metformin. After adjustment, DPP-4i was associated with lower risk of MACE than sulfonylurea (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 0.87; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.78-0.98), and similar risk to metformin (aHR = 1.07; 95% CI: 0.97-1.18). Risk for acute myocardial infarction (aHR = 0.70; 95% CI: 0.51-0.96), stroke (aHR = 0.57; 95% CI: 0.41-0.79), and heart failure (aHR = 0.57; 95% CI: 0.41-0.79) with DPP-4i was lower compared to sulfonylureas.

   CONCLUSION: Our findings show that for this cohort of low-risk patients newly treated for type 2 diabetes, DPP-4i exhibited 13% lower risk for MACE compared to sulfonylureas and similar risk for MACE compared to metformin, suggesting DPP-4i is a low cardiovascular risk option for low-risk patients initiating antihyperglycemic treatment.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: Many Chinese patients who are uncontrolled by oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) receive short-term intensive insulin therapy (IIT) in hospital to rapidly relieve glucose-associated toxicity and to preserve/improve beta-cell function. However, evidence for optimizing insulin algorithms for maintenance treatment after IIT is lacking. This study will compare the efficacy and safety of basal insulin-based treatment versus twice-daily premixed insulin in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients after short-term in-hospital IIT.

   METHODS: This 26-week randomized, multicenter, positive-controlled, open-label, parallel-group study will enroll approximately 400 male and female patients aged 18-70 years with poorly-controlled T2DM (HbA1c > 7.5%) despite treatment with metformin plus at least one other OAD for 8 or more weeks. During a run-in period of 7-10 days, patients will be treated in-hospital with IIT comprising insulin glargine (Lantus R) once daily and insulin glulisine (Apidra R) three times daily; both regimens will be titrated daily to achieve the glycemic goal. Eligible patients will then be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to insulin glargine plus OADs or twice-daily premixed insulin (NovoLog R Mix 70/30) for 24 weeks, with metformin maintained throughout the study in both treatment groups. The primary endpoint is HbA1c change from baseline to week 24. Secondary endpoints include assessment of fasting plasma glucose, total daily insulin dose, hypoglycemia incidence, body weight change, adverse events, and patient satisfaction.

   DISCUSSION: Given the current lack of clinical data, this study will provide evidence supporting safe and effective glycemic control using basal insulin glargine-based therapy plus OADs compared with twice-daily premixed insulin in Chinese patients with T2DM after short-term IIT. This will assist physicians by providing a wider choice of treatments.

Abstract
  AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of metformin in diabetes prevention in a prediabetic population across a range of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels at baseline. A secondary aim was to assess the effectiveness of metformin in preventing diabetes in those participants where impaired fasting glucose (IFG) was relatively more pronounced as opposed to impaired glucose tolerance (IGT).

   METHODS: Participants randomised to metformin and placebo arms in the Diabetes Prevention Program study were stratified into cohorts according to level of FPG at baseline. Cumulative incidence of diabetes for the different cohorts was assessed. Change in FPG, insulin sensitivity, and levels of fasting insulin and proinsulin for the different cohorts were also calculated.

   RESULTS: The largest reductions in incidence of diabetes and FPG occurred within prediabetic persons with a higher level of FPG at baseline. Metformin was able to stabilise insulin sensitivity in every stratified sub-cohort except one. Sub-cohorts which had higher levels of insulin sensitivity at baseline experienced the largest increases in insulin sensitivity. Metformin reduced the incidence of diabetes by 43% (RR 0.57, CI 0.4-0.9) in those prediabetic persons whose IFG was more pronounced compared to a 26% (RR 0.74 CI 0.7-0.8) when all participants in the study were included.

   CONCLUSION: The largest reductions in both incidence of diabetes and FPG occurred in prediabetic persons with a higher level of FPG at baseline. Metformin was able to stabilise insulin sensitivity and was more effective in persons with more pronounced IFG.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Mexico has one of the highest prevalence rates of obesity worldwide. New pharmacological strategies that focus on people with class III obesity are required. Metformin and dapagliflozin are two drugs approved for the treatment of diabetes. Beyond its effects on glucose, metformin has been suggested by some studies to result in weight loss. Therapy with dapagliflozin is associated with a mild but sustained weight loss in patients with diabetes. The primary outcome of the study is to determine if the combined treatment with dapagliflozin and metformin is more effective than monotherapy with metformin for weight loss in patients with class III obesity and prediabetes or diabetes who are awaiting bariatric surgery (including those patients who do have surgery). We also aimed to assess the effect of this combined treatment on waist circumference, triglycerides, blood pressure, and inflammatory cytokines.

   METHODS: This randomized phase IV clinical trial will include patients with diabetes or prediabetes who are between the ages of 18 and 60 years and exhibit grade III obesity (defined as body mass index >= 40 kg/m2). Patients using insulin will be excluded. Subjects will be randomized to one of two groups as follows: 1) metformin tablets 850 mg PO bid or 2) metformin tablets 850 mg PO bid plus dapagliflozin tablets 10 mg PO qd. The sample size required is 108 patients, which allows for a 20% dropout rate: 54 patients in the metformin group and 54 in the metformin/dapagliflozin group. All participants will receive personalized nutritional advice during the study. A run-in period of one month will be used to assess tolerance and adherence to treatment regimens. Anthropometric and biochemical variables will be recorded at baseline and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. A serum sample to determine glucagon, ghrelin, adiponectin, resistin, interleukin 6, and interleukin 10 will be collected at baseline and before surgery, or at 12 months (whatever happens first). Adherence to treatment and adverse and secondary events will be recorded throughout the study. An intention-to-treat analysis will be used.

   DISCUSSION: Forty-six percent of the patients in our Obesity Clinic have been diagnosed with prediabetes (32%) or diabetes (14%). The use of dapagliflozin in this population could improve weight loss and other cardiovascular factors. This effect could be translated into less time before undergoing bariatric surgery and better control of associated comorbidities.

Abstract
  Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is associated with both poorer clinical outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic and an increased risk of death in such hospitalized patients. While the role of glucose control has been emphasized to improve the prognosis, the impact of different glucose-lowering agents remains largely unknown. Metformin remains the first-line pharmacological choice for the management of hyperglycaemia in T2DM. Because metformin exerts various effects beyond its glucose-lowering action, among which are anti-inflammatory effects, it may be speculated that this biguanide might positively influence the prognosis of patients with T2DM hospitalized for COVID-19. The present concise review summarizes the available data from observational retrospective studies that have shown a reduction in mortality in metformin users compared with non-users, and briefly discusses the potential underlying mechanisms that might perhaps explain this favourable impact. However, given the potential confounders inherently found in observational studies, caution is required before drawing any firm conclusions in the absence of randomized controlled trials.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: Dual incretin receptor agonists in clinical development have shown reductions in body weight and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in patients with type 2 diabetes, but the impact of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptor activation remains unclear. Here, we evaluated the effects of high-dose exogenous GIP on energy intake, energy expenditure, plasma glucose, and glucose-regulating hormones in patients with type 2 diabetes treated with a long-acting glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist.

   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind design, men with type 2 diabetes (n = 22, mean +/- SEM HbA1c 6.8 +/- 0.1% [51 +/- 1.5 mmol/mol]) treated with metformin and long-acting GLP-1R agonists were subjected to two 5-h continuous infusions (separated by a washout period of >=3 days): one with GIP (6 pmol/kg/min) and another with saline (placebo). After 60 min of infusion, a liquid mixed-meal test was performed, and after 270 min of infusion, an ad libitum meal was served for evaluation of energy intake (primary end point).

   RESULTS: Energy intake was similar during GIP and placebo infusion (648 +/- 74 kcal vs. 594 +/- 55 kcal, respectively; P = 0.480), as were appetite measures and energy expenditure. Plasma glucagon and glucose were higher during GIP infusion compared with placebo infusion (P = 0.026 and P = 0.017) as assessed by area under the curve.

   CONCLUSIONS: In patients with type 2 diabetes, GIP infusion on top of treatment with metformin and a long-acting GLP-1R agonist did not affect energy intake, appetite, or energy expenditure but increased plasma glucose compared with placebo. These results indicate no acute beneficial effects of combining GIP and GLP-1. Copyright © 2020 by the American Diabetes Association.

Abstract
  We aimed to determine whether sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) and incretin-based agents combination therapy produces more benefits than SGLT2is alone in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing SGLT2is plus Dipeptidyl-Peptidase 4 inhibitors (SGLT2is/DPP4is) or glucagon like peptide-1 receptor agonists (SGLT2is/GLP-1RAs) against SGLT2is as monotherapy or add-on to metformin in T2DMs. A total of 13 studies with 7350 participants were included. Combination with GLP-1RAs exhibited more HbA1c reduction (WMD: -0.8; 95% CI, -1.14 to -0.45%), weight loss (-1.46; 95% CI, -2.38 to -0.54 kg), and systolic blood pressure (SBP) reduction (-2.88; 95% CI, -4.52 to -1.25 mmHg) versus SGLT2is alone but increased the gastrointestinal disorder risk (RR: 1.68; 95% CI, 1.14-2.47). Combination with DPP4is exhibited an extra effect on HbA1c reduction (-0.47; 95% CI, -0.58 to -0.37%), a neutral effect on weight (0.19; 95% CI, -0.11 to 0.48 kg) and SBP (-0.01; 95% CI, -0.85 to 0.63 mmHg), and ameliorated the genital infections risk (0.73; 95% CI, 0.54-0.97) versus SGLT2is. Meta-regression indicated the hypoglycemic efficacy of SGLT2is/DPP4is is higher in Asians than in other ethnics, and the differences in BMI across ethnic groups may mediate this effect. SGLT2is and incretin-based agents combination therapy is efficacious and safe versus SGLT2is alone in T2DMs. Particularly, combination with GLP-1RAs shows additional benefits to glycemic, weight, and SBP control to a larger extent than DPP4is, while combination with DPP4is ameliorates the risk for genital infection seen with SGLT2is. We highlight the need for individualized treatment related to the selection of this novel combination therapy. Copyright © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Vitamin D (VD) may increase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and subsequently PPAR-gamma coactivator 1alpha (PGC-1alpha) and irisin levels and these improvements may reduce insulin resistance (IR). The aim was to assess the effects of vitamin D supplementation on SIRT1, irisin, and IR in overweight/obese type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients.

   METHODS: Ninety T2D males and females were recruited as a clinical trial study (mean of age and body mass index (BMI) of intervention and placebo groups were 50.05 +/- 10.17 and 50.36 +/- 10.2 yrs. and 31.37 +/- 3.4 and 30.43 +/- 3.2 kg/m2, respectively). The inclusion criteria were T2D, VD deficient, BMI > 25 kg/m2, and serum HbA1c < 8.5%. The exclusion criteria were using vitamin and mineral supplements, having any acute disease, recent modifying dose or type of drugs. The supplementation was 50,000 IU/week VD or placebo for 8 weeks. The demographic characteristics, anthropometrics, dietary intakes and physical activity status, sun exposure status, fasting blood sugar (FBS) and insulin, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), irisin, SIRT1, 25-hydroxy D3 (25(OH)VD), homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) were determined. The significant P-value was <=0.05.

   RESULTS: The increase of serum VD, SIRT1, and irisin in the intervention group was significant (p < 0.001). HbA1c was decreased significantly by 1%. The changes in the other glucose indices (FBS, insulin, and IR) were non-significant.

   CONCLUSIONS: VD supplementation may improve T2D by decreasing HbA1c and increasing SIRT1 and irisin in VD deficient T2D patients. Further trials are suggested.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: The extent to which infertility and pregnancy independently increase risk of diabetes and subclinical atherosclerosis is not known.

   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis of Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) and the DPP Outcomes Study over a 15-year period. We included women who answered questions about gravidity and infertility at baseline (n = 2085). Infertility was defined as > 1 year of unsuccessful attempts to conceive; thus, women could have histories of infertility as well as pregnancy. Risk of diabetes associated with gravidity and infertility was calculated using Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, treatment arm, body mass index, and pregnancy during the study. Among women who underwent assessment of coronary artery calcification (CAC) (n = 1337), odds of CAC were calculated using logistic regression models with similar covariates.

   RESULTS: Among premenopausal women (n = 1075), women with histories of pregnancy and infertility (n = 147; hazard ratio [HR] 1.80; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.30, 2.49) and women with histories of pregnancy without infertility (n = 736; HR 1.49; 95% CI 1.15, 1.93) had greater diabetes risk than nulligravid women without infertility (n = 173). Premenopausal nulligravid women with histories of infertility had a non-significant elevation in risk, although the number of these women was small (n = 19; HR 1.63; 95% CI 0.88, 3.03). Associations were not observed among postmenopausal women (n = 1010). No associations were observed between infertility or pregnancy with CAC.

   CONCLUSIONS: Pregnancy, particularly combined with a history of infertility, confers increased risk of diabetes but not CAC among glucose-intolerant premenopausal women. Copyright © Endocrine Society 2020. All rights reserved. For permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com.

Abstract
  IMPORTANCE: Intensive lifestyle change (e.g., the Diabetes Prevention Program) and metformin reduce type 2 diabetes risk among patients with prediabetes. However, real-world uptake remains low. Shared decision-making (SDM) may increase awareness and help patients select and follow through with informed options for diabetes prevention that are aligned with their preferences.

   OBJECTIVE: To test the effectiveness of a prediabetes SDM intervention.

   DESIGN: Cluster randomized controlled trial.

   SETTING: Twenty primary care clinics within a large regional health system.

   PARTICIPANTS: Overweight/obese adults with prediabetes (BMI >= 24 kg/m2 and HbA1c 5.7-6.4%) were enrolled from 10 SDM intervention clinics. Propensity score matching was used to identify control patients from 10 usual care clinics.

   INTERVENTION: Intervention clinic patients were invited to participate in a face-to-face SDM visit with a pharmacist who used a decision aid (DA) to describe prediabetes and four possible options for diabetes prevention: DPP, DPP +/- metformin, metformin only, or usual care.

   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary endpoint was uptake of DPP (>= 9 sessions), metformin, or both strategies at 4 months. Secondary endpoint was weight change (lbs.) at 12 months.

   RESULTS: Uptake of DPP and/or metformin was higher among SDM participants (n = 351) than controls receiving usual care (n = 1028; 38% vs. 2%, p < .001). At 12-month follow-up, adjusted weight loss (lbs.) was greater among SDM participants than controls (- 5.3 vs. - 0.2, p < .001).

   LIMITATIONS: Absence of DPP supplier participation data for matched patients in usual care clinics.

   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: A prediabetes SDM intervention led by pharmacists increased patient engagement in evidence-based options for diabetes prevention and was associated with significantly greater uptake of DPP and/or metformin at 4 months and weight loss at 12 months. Prediabetes SDM may be a promising approach to enhance prevention efforts among patients at increased risk.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine the prevalence of vitamin B12 deficiency amongst diabetic patients on metformin therapy.

   METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted at general clinics at the University Health Center and diabetes outpatient clinics at Sultan Qaboos University Hospital, Muscat, Oman, between January and December 2017. All Omani adults who were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus and took metformin were invited to participate in the study. The variables included in this study were age, gender, duration of diabetes, dose and duration of metformin therapy, haemoglobin and glycosylated haemoglobin level.

   RESULTS: A total of 248 subjects were included (response rate = 95.4%) of which 26 (10.5%) were vitamin B12 deficient and 53 (21.4%) were borderline deficient. The mean daily dose of metformin was highest among vitamin B12 deficient group (1,981 +/- 222 mg; P = 0.004).

   CONCLUSION: The prevalence of vitamin B12 deficiency is considerable among diabetic patients on metformin therapy. Further research is needed to confirm the need for routine screening and monitoring. © Copyright 2020, Sultan Qaboos University Medical Journal, All Rights Reserved.

Abstract
  Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is a hormone of the incretin system responsible for a variety of glucoregulatory effects, including glucose-dependent secretion of insulin and inhibition of glucagon release, the effects of which are impaired in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Targeting this deficiency using GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) is a well-established approach in T2D, with over a decade of clinical experience now accrued. This article reviews the evidence for subcutaneous GLP-1RAs and their role in T2D treatment, and explores the rationale for an oral GLP-1RA from a primary care perspective. Clinical trials and real-world studies with subcutaneous GLP-1RAs indicate that these agents have good glycated hemoglobin (HbA1 c)-lowering efficacy, an inherently low potential for hypoglycemia, and reduce body weight. Cardiovascular outcomes trials have established cardiovascular safety, and three GLP-1RAs have been proven to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with established cardiovascular disease or at high cardiovascular risk. The most common adverse events associated with GLP-1RAs are gastrointestinal effects, which tend to occur soon after initiation and decline over time. T2D treatment guidelines recommend GLP-1RAs as a therapeutic option in various settings, including in those patients: i) not achieving HbA1 c targets after first-line metformin and lifestyle modifications; ii) at high risk of/with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (regardless of HbA1c; GLP-1RAs of proven benefit); iii) not achieving HbA1 c targets on basal insulin if not already receiving a GLP-1RA. Despite the known benefits of GLP-1RAs, adherence and persistence rates are suboptimal, potentially due in part to injection-related concerns. With some patients having a preference for oral medications, the development of an oral GLP-1RA is a logical approach to improving treatment options for patients with T2D. Co-formulation of semaglutide with an absorption enhancer has enabled the development and recent approval of the first oral GLP-1RA, oral semaglutide, which has the potential to expand use of GLP-1RAs in clinical practice.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: Studies have confirmed that endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are involved in diabetic complications. The present study assessed the action of the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor sitagliptin on EPCs in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes patients.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: 60 newly-diagnosed type 2 diabetes patients were randomly divided into three treatment groups: sitagliptin (n = 20), metformin (n = 20), and combination sitagliptin and metformin (n = 20). Patients were treated once daily for 3 days. Before and after each treatment, the number of EPCs and concentration of soluble mediators (glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), nitric oxide (NO), endothelin-1 (ET-1), and stromal cell-derived factor-1alpha (SDF-1alpha)) were determined.

   RESULTS: The number of CD34+KDR+ and CD34+CD133+KDR+ EPCs and concentration of GLP-1, NO, and SDF-1alpha in sitagliptin and combination groups were both increased (both p < 0.05) but to a greater extent in the combination group (p < 0.05). Pearson correlation analysis and multiple linear regression analyses showed that the change in EPC numbers correlated with changes in peripheral GLP-1, NO, and SDF-1alpha levels (p < 0.05).

   CONCLUSION: Sitagliptin is able to directly increase the number of peripheral blood EPCs. This direct effect is to be important for lowering vascular risk in early diabetes before macrovascular complications appear.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Effective glycemic control can reduce the risk of complications and their related costs in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Many patients fail to reach hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) <= 6.5% or < 7.0%, often due to adverse effects of treatment, such as hypoglycemia and weight gain. Glycemic targets should be individualized and consider multiple factors, including the risk of adverse events and the patient's characteristics and comorbid conditions.

   OBJECTIVE: To compare the odds and annual cost of achieving treatment targets, which incorporate HbA1c targets of < 7.5%, < 8.0%, and <= 9.0%, with insulin degludec/liraglutide (IDegLira) versus basal insulin and basal-bolus therapy.

   METHODS: This is a post hoc analysis of the DUAL V and DUAL VII 26-week trials, which randomized patients with T2D uncontrolled (HbA1c 7%-10%) on insulin glargine 100 units/mL (IGlar U100) and metformin to IDegLira or continued IGlar U100 titration (DUAL V) or IGlar U100 + insulin aspart (DUAL VII), all with metformin. Proportions of patients achieving HbA1c targets (< 7.5%, < 8.0%, and <= 9.0%) by the end of trial were assessed via 3 outcomes: alone, without either hypoglycemia or weight gain (double composite outcome), or without a combination of hypoglycemia and weight gain (triple composite outcome). The cost per patient achieving the triple composite outcome at each HbA1c target (< 7.5%, < 8.0%, and <= 9.0%) was calculated by dividing the annual cost of treatment by the proportion of patients achieving the target. This short-term (1-year) cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted from the perspective of a U.S. health care payer.

   RESULTS: More patients achieved HbA1c < 7.5% (P < 0.0001) and < 8.0% (P = 0.0003), and a similar percentage achieved HbA1c <= 9.0% with IDegLira versus IGlar U100 (DUAL V). Similar proportions of patients achieved all 3 HbA1c targets with IDegLira compared with basal-bolus therapy (DUAL VII). The odds of achieving double or triple composite outcomes were significantly higher for IDegLira versus IGlar U100 or basal-bolus for all 3 HbA1c targets (P < 0.0001 in each case) in both trials. For each $1 spent on IDegLira, the equivalent annual costs per patient to achieve HbA1c targets of < 7.5%, < 8.0%, or <= 9.0% without hypoglycemia and without weight gain were $2.43, $2.10, and $2.05, respectively, for IGlar U100 and $6.33, $5.80, and $6.06, respectively, for basal-bolus therapy.

   CONCLUSIONS: Based on data from DUAL V and DUAL VII, this analysis showed that a greater or similar proportion of patients with T2D reached HbA1c targets with IDegLira compared with IGlar U100/basal-bolus therapy. Odds of achieving double or triple composite outcomes of HbA1c reduction without hypoglycemia and/or without weight gain were greatest for IDegLira. Short-term cost analyses based on the triple composite outcomes suggest that IDegLira is a cost-effective treatment option in the United States compared with either uptitration of IGlar U100 or basal-bolus therapy.

Abstract
  The management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is becoming increasingly complex. Sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) are the newest antidiabetic agents for T2DM. By targeting the kidney, they have a unique mechanism of action, which results in enhanced glucosuria, osmotic diuresis and natriuresis, thereby improving glucose control with a limited risk of hypoglycaemia and exerting additional positive effects such as weight loss and the lowering of blood pressure. Several outcome studies with canagliflozin, dapagliflozin or empagliflozin reported a statistically significant reduction in major cardiovascular events, hospitalization for heart failure and progression to advanced renal disease in patients with T2DM who have established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, several cardiovascular risk factors, albuminuric mild to moderate chronic kidney disease or heart failure. Current guidelines proposed a new paradigm in the management of T2DM, with a preferential place for SGLT2is, after metformin, in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure and progressive kidney disease. Ongoing trials might extend the therapeutic potential of SGLT2is in patients with, but also without, T2DM. This Review provides an update of the current knowledge on SGLT2is, moving from their use as glucose-lowering medications to their new positioning as cardiovascular and renal protective agents.

Abstract
  AIMS: Predicting likely durability of glucose-lowering therapies for people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) could help inform individualised therapeutic choices.

   METHODS: We used data from UKPDS patients with newly-diagnosed T2D randomised to first-line glucose-lowering monotherapy with chlorpropamide-glibenclamide-basal insulin or metformin. In 2339 participants who achieved one-year HbA1c values <7.5% (<59 mmol/mol)-we assessed relationships between one-year characteristics and time to monotherapy-failure (HbA1c >= 7.5% or requiring second-line therapy). Model validation was performed using bootstrap sampling.

   RESULTS: Follow-up was median (IQR) 11.0 (8.0-14.0) years. Monotherapy-failure occurred in 72%-82%-75% and 79% for those randomised to chlorpropamide-glibenclamide-basal insulin or metformin respectively-after median 4.5 (3.0-6.6)-3.7 (2.6-5.6)-4.2 (2.7-6.5) and 3.8 (2.6- 5.2) years. Time-to-monotherapy-failure was predicted primarily by HbA1c and BMI values-with other risk factors varying by type of monotherapy-with predictions to within +/-2.5 years for 55%-60%-56% and 57% of the chlorpropamide-glibenclamide-basal insulin and metformin monotherapy cohorts respectively.

   CONCLUSIONS: Post one-year glycaemic durability can be predicted robustly in individuals with newly-diagnosed T2D who achieve HbA1c values < 7.5% one year after commencing traditional monotherapies. Such information could be used to help guide glycaemic management for individual patients. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: In randomised clinical trials, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors reduced cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) at high cardiovascular risk, as compared to standard care. However, data comparing these agents in patients with T2D who are at moderate risk is sparse.

   METHODS: From Danish national registries, we included patients with T2D previously on metformin monotherapy, who started an additional glucose-lowering agent [GLP-1 RA, SGLT-2 inhibitor, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, sulfonylurea (SU), or insulin] in the period 2010-2016. Patients with a history of cardiovascular events [heart failure (HF), myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke] were excluded. Patients were followed for up to 2 years. Cause-specific adjusted Cox regression models were used to compare the risk of hospitalisation for HF, a composite endpoint of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) (MI, stroke or cardiovascular death), and all-cause mortality for each add-on therapy. Patients who initiated DPP-4 inhibitors were used as reference.

   RESULTS: The study included 46,986 T2D patients with a median age of 61 years and of which 59% were male. The median duration of metformin monotherapy prior to study inclusion was 5.3 years. Add-on therapy was distributed as follows: 13,148 (28%) GLP-1 RAs, 2343 (5%) SGLT-2 inhibitors, 15,426 (33%) DPP-4 inhibitors, 8917 (19%) SUs, and 7152 (15%) insulin. During follow-up, 623 (1.3%, range 0.8-2.1%) patients were hospitalised for HF-hazard ratios (HR) were 1.11 (95% CI 0.89-1.39) for GLP-1 RA, 0.84 (0.52-1.36) for SGLT-2 inhibitors, 0.98 (0.77-1.26) for SU and 1.54 (1.25-1.91) for insulin. The composite MACE endpoint occurred in 1196 (2.5%, range 1.5-3.6%) patients, yielding HRs of 0.82 (0.69-0.97) for GLP-1 RAs, 0.79 (0.56-1.12) for SGLT-2 inhibitors, 1.22 (1.03-1.49) for SU and 1.23 (1.07-1.47) for insulin. 1865 (3.9%, range 1.9-9.0%) died from any cause during follow-up. HRs for all-cause mortality were 0.91 (0.78-1.05) for GLP-1 RAs, 0.79 (0.58-1.07) for SGLT-2 inhibitors, 1.13 (0.99-1.31) for SU and 2.33 (2.08-2.61) for insulin.

   CONCLUSION: In a nationwide cohort of metformin-treated T2D patients and no history of cardiovascular events, the addition of either GLP-1 RA or SGLT-2 inhibitor to metformin treatment was associated with a similar risk of hospitalisation for HF and death, and a lower risk of MACE for GLP-1 RA when compared with add-on DPP-4 inhibitors. By contrast, initiation of treatment with SU and insulin were associated with a higher risk of MACE. Additionally, insulin was associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality and hospitalisation for HF.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: The potential for PPAR agonists to positively affect risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is of persistent attention. The PRESS XII study primarily aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of saroglitazar (2 mg and 4 mg) as compared to pioglitazone 30 mg on glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

   METHODS: In this randomized double-blind study, patients with T2DM [glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) >= 7.5%] were enrolled from 39 sites in India. Patients received once-daily doses of either saroglitazar or pioglitazone (1:1:1 allocation ratio) for a total of 24 weeks. Patients were continued in a double blind extension period for an additional 32 weeks. Efficacy evaluations of glycemic parameters [HbA1c (Primary endpoint at week 24), FPG and PPG] and other lipid parameters (TG, LDL-C, VLDL-C, HDL-C, TC, Non HDL-C, Apo A1 and Apo B) were conducted at week 12, 24 and 56 and compared to the baseline levels. The efficacy analyses were performed by using paired t-test and ANCOVA model.

   RESULTS: A total of 1155 patients were enrolled in this study. The baseline characteristics were similar between the three treatment groups. The within group mean (+/- SD) change in HbA1c (%) from baseline of the saroglitazar (2 mg and 4 mg) and pioglitazone treatment groups at week 24 were: - 1.38 +/- 1.99 for saroglitazar 2 mg; - 1.47 +/- 1.92 for saroglitazar 4 mg and - 1.41 +/- 1.86 for pioglitazone, respectively. Statistically significant reduction from baseline in HbA1c was observed in each treatment group at week 24 with p-value < 0.016. There was a significant reduction in TG, LDL-C, VLDL-C, TC and Non HDL-C with a significant increase in HDL-C from baseline levels (< 0.016). Most of the AE's were 'mild' to 'moderate' in severity and were resolved by the completion of the study.

   CONCLUSIONS: Saroglitazar effectively improved glycemic control and lipid parameters over 56 weeks in patients of T2DM receiving background metformin therapy and has a promising potential to reduce the cardiovascular risk in T2DM patients.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Endothelial Progenitor cells (EPCs) has been shown to be dysfunctional in both type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) leading to poor regeneration of endothelium and renal perfusion. EPCs have been shown to be a robust cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk indicator. Cellular mechanisms of DPP4 inhibitors such as linagliptin (LG) on CVD risk, in patients with T2DM with established CKD has not been established. Linagliptin, a DPP4 inhibitor when added to insulin, metformin or both may improve endothelial dysfunction in a diabetic kidney disease (DKD) population.

   METHODS: 31 subjects taking metformin and/or Insulin were enrolled in this 12 weeks, double blind, randomized placebo matched trial, with 5 mg LG compared to placebo. Type 2 diabetes subjects (30-70 years old), HbA1c of 6.5-10%, CKD Stage 1-3 were included. CD34+ cell number, migratory function, gene expression along with vascular parameters such as arterial stiffness, biochemistry, resting energy expenditure and body composition were measured. Data were collected at week 0, 6 and 12. A mixed model regression analysis was done with p value < 0.05 considered significant.

   RESULTS: A double positive CD34/CD184 cell count had a statistically significant increase (p < 0.02) as determined by flow cytometry in LG group where CD184 is SDF1a cell surface receptor. Though mRNA differences in CD34+ve was more pronounced CD34- cell mRNA analysis showed increase in antioxidants (superoxide dismutase 2 or SOD2, Catalase and Glutathione Peroxidase or GPX) and prominent endothelial markers (PECAM1, VEGF-A, vWF and NOS3). Arterial stiffness measures such as augmentation Index (AI) (p < 0.04) and pulse wave analysis (PWV) were improved (reduced in stiffness) in LG group. A reduction in LDL: HDL ratio was noted in treatment group (p < 0.04). Urinary exosome protein examining podocyte health (podocalyxin, Wilms tumor and nephrin) showed reduction or improvement.

   CONCLUSIONS: In DKD subjects, Linagliptin promotes an increase in CXCR4 expression on CD34 + progenitor cells with a concomitant improvement in vascular and renal parameters at 12 weeks. Trial Registration Number NCT02467478 Date of Registration: 06/08/2015.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Although metformin is increasingly being used in women with type 2 diabetes during pregnancy, little data exist on the benefits and harms of metformin use on pregnancy outcomes in these women. We aimed to investigate the effects of the addition of metformin to a standard regimen of insulin on neonatal morbidity and mortality in pregnant women with type 2 diabetes.

   METHODS: In this prospective, multicentre, international, randomised, parallel, double-masked, placebo-controlled trial, women with type 2 diabetes during pregnancy were randomly assigned from 25 centres in Canada and four in Australia to receive either metformin 1000 mg twice daily or placebo, added to insulin. Randomisation was done via a web-based computerised randomisation service and stratified by centre and pre-pregnancy BMI (<30 kg/m2 or >=30 kg/m2) in a ratio of 1:1 using random block sizes of 4 and 6. Women were eligible if they had type 2 diabetes, were on insulin, had a singleton viable pregnancy, and were between 6 and 22 weeks plus 6 days' gestation. Participants were asked to check their fasting blood glucose level before the first meal of the day, before the last meal of the day, and 2 h after each meal. Insulin doses were adjusted aiming for identical glucose targets (fasting glucose <5.3 mmol/L [95 mg/dL], 2-h postprandial glucose <6.7 mmol/L [120 mg/dL]). Study visits were done monthly and patients were seen every 1-4 weeks as was needed for standard clinical care. At study visits blood pressure and bodyweight were measured; patients were asked about tolerance to their pills, any hospitalisations, insulin doses, and severe hypoglycaemia events; and glucometer readings were downloaded to the central coordinating centre. Participants , caregivers, and outcome assessors were masked to the intervention. The primary outcome was a composite of fetal and neonatal outcomes, for which we calculated the relative risk and 95% CI between groups, stratifying by site and BMI using a log-binomial regression model with an intention-to-treat analysis. Secondary outcomes included several relevant maternal and neonatal outcomes. The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01353391.

   FINDINGS: Between May 25, 2011, and Oct 11, 2018, we randomly assigned 502 women, 253 (50%) to metformin and 249 (50%) to placebo. Complete data were available for 233 (92%) participants in the metformin group and 240 (96%) in the placebo group for the primary outcome. We found no significant difference in the primary composite neonatal outcome between the two groups (40% vs 40%; p=0.86; relative risk [RR] 1.02 [0.83 to 1.26]). Compared with women in the placebo group, metformin-treated women achieved better glycaemic control (HbA1c at 34 weeks' gestation 41.0 mmol/mol [SD 8.5] vs 43.2 mmol/mol [-10]; 5.90% vs 6.10%; p=0.015; mean glucose 6.05 [0.93] vs 6.27 [0.90]; difference -0.2 [-0.4 to 0.0]), required less insulin (1.1 units per kg per day vs 1.5 units per kg per day; difference -0.4 [95% CI -0.5 to -0.2]; p<0.0001), gained less weight (7.2 kg vs 9.0 kg; difference -1.8 [-2.7 to -0.9]; p<0.0001) and had fewer caesarean births (125 [53%] of 234 in the metformin group vs 148 [63%] of 236 in the placebo group; relative risk [RR] 0.85 [95% CI 0.73 to 0.99]; p=0.031). We found no significant difference between the groups in hypertensive disorders (55 [23%] in the metformin group vs 56 [23%] in the placebo group; p=0.93; RR 0.99 [0.72 to 1.35]). Compared with those in the placebo group, metformin-exposed infants weighed less (mean birthweight 3156 g [SD 742] vs 3375 g [742]; difference -218 [-353 to -82]; p=0.002), fewer were above the 97th centile for birthweight (20 [9%] in the metformin group vs 34 [15%] in the placebo group; RR 0.58 [0.34 to 0.97]; p=0.041), fewer weighed 4000 g or more at birth (28 [12%] in the metformin group vs 44 [19%] in the placebo group; RR 0.65 [0.43 to 0.99]; p=0.046), and metformin-exposed infants had reduced adiposity measures (mean sum of skinfolds 16.0 mm [SD 5.0] vs 17.4 [6.2] mm; difference -1.41 [-2.6 to -0.2]; p=0.024; mean neonatal fat mass 13.2 [SD 6.2] vs 14.6 [5.0]; p=0.017). 30 (13%) infants in the metformin group and 15 (7%) in the placebo group were small for gestational age (RR 1.96 [1.10 to 3.64]; p=0.026). We found no significant difference in the cord c-peptide between groups (673 pmol/L [435] in the metformin group vs 758 pmol/L [595] in the placebo group; p=0.10; ratio of means 0.88 [0.72 to 1.02]). The most common adverse event reported was gastrointestinal (38 events in the metformin group and 38 events in the placebo group).

   INTERPRETATION: We found several maternal glycaemic and neonatal adiposity benefits in the metformin group. Along with reduced maternal weight gain and insulin dosage and improved glycaemic control, the lower adiposity and infant size measurements resulted in fewer large infants but a higher proportion of small-for-gestational-age infants. Understanding the implications of these effects on infants will be important to properly advise patients who are contemplating the use of metformin during pregnancy.

Abstract
  Activation of fractalkine and other chemokines plays an important role in atherogenesis and, in conjunction with endothelial dysfunction, promotes premature vascular damage in obesity and diabetes. We hypothesized that increased circulating fractalkine coexists with impaired vasomotor function in metabolically healthy or unhealthy obesity, and that treatment with antidiabetic drugs may impact these abnormalities in type 2 diabetes. Compared to lean subjects, in both obese groups the vasodilator responses to acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside were impaired (both P < .001); ETA-receptor blockade resulted in greater vasodilation (both P < .001); and plasma levels of fractalkine, E-selectin and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 were increased (all P < .05). In diabetic patients, oral antidiabetic drugs (glyburide, metformin or pioglitazone) reduced circulating levels fractalkine and E-selectin (both P < .05), without affecting vascular responses (all P > .05). Our findings indicate that insulin resistant states are associated with elevated atherogenic chemokines and impaired vascular reactivity. Antidiabetic treatment results in lower circulating fractalkine, which may provide cardiovascular benefits. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  Background: Anti-hyperglycemic drug dipeptidyl peptidase-IV inhibitors (DPP-4i) have recently been recognized as bullous pemphigoid (BP) inducing drugs. It remains uncertain whether DPP-4i induce BP-IgG autoantibodies before the onset of BP. Objective: To evaluate the effect of DPP-4i in the development of BP-IgG autoantibodies in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients. Methods: A cross-sectional study on 221 DPP-4i (+) and 54 DPP-4i (-) T2DM cases was conducted. BP180 NC16A, BP230, and full-length BP180 ELISAs were used to detect the BP-IgG autoantibodies. We have also statistically analyzed the proportion of age, gender, intake periods of DPP-4i, and hemoglobin A1c level between anti-full-length BP180 IgG-positive and -negative DPP-4i (+) T2DM cases to identify co-founding factors. Results: BP180 NC16A ELISA, BP230 ELISA, and full-length BP180 ELISA were positive in 1.8, 2.2, and 10.9% of DPP-4i (+) T2DM cases, respectively; in contrast, they were positive in 0, 7.4, and 5.6% of DPP-4i (-) T2DM cases, respectively. The odds ratio for the development of BP-IgG autoantibodies detected by full-length BP180 ELISA was 2.070 for DPP-4i (+). There were no significant differences between the genders, intake periods of DPP-4i, nor of hemoglobin A1c levels, the anti-full-length BP180 IgG-positive cases tended to be significantly older than anti-full-length BP180 IgG-negative cases (median 74 vs. 69, p = 0.025) in the DPP-4i (+) T2DM cases. Limitations: We focused the analysis on DPP-4i intake and not on the effects of metformin and other drugs. Conclusion:  Exposure to specific DPP-4i may induce the development of anti-full-length BP180 autoantibodies even in T2DM patients without any clinical symptoms of BP. Aging would be a risk factor to develop anti-full-length BP180-IgG autoantibody in DPP-4i (+) T2DM cases.

Abstract
  Polycystic ovary syndrome is a complex and heterogenous disorder involving multiple organ systems and different molecular pathways. It is tightly associated with obesity and especially abdominal obesity. As body weight reduction is the main modifiable risk factor for polycystic ovary syndrome, therapeutic approaches in overweight or obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome have been developed. Liraglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist that promotes sustained weight loss, as well as abdominal fat reduction, in individuals with obesity, prediabetes, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The majority of current clinical studies have demonstrated that liraglutide therapy achieved significant reductions in body weight, body mass index, and abdominal circumference in overweight and obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome. Liraglutide therapy promoted significant improvements in free testosterone and sex hormone-binding globulin levels in some studies. Important metabolic and hormonal improvements were also reported after the combination of liraglutide with metformin. Increased menstrual frequency, as well as potential positive effects in reproduction, were described. However, the small number of participants, short duration, and low daily liraglutide dose are some of the main limitations of these studies. Larger and longer, multi-centred, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of liraglutide monotherapy or combination therapy, with prolonged post-interventional monitoring, are crucially anticipated. Metabolic, hormonal, and reproductive primary outcomes should be uniformly addressed, to tailor future targeted treatment approaches, according to the patient phenotype and needs. This will improve long-term therapeutic outcomes in this population.

Abstract
  AIMS: To investigate the efficacy and safety of insulin degludec/liraglutide (IDegLira) compared with 50 U insulin degludec (degludec) or less in Japanese individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D).

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this 26-week, double-blind, multicentre, treat-to-target trial, Japanese individuals with T2D that was uncontrolled with basal or pre-mix insulin (20-50 units) were randomized (1:1) to receive IDegLira or degludec, both with metformin. The maximum dose was 50 dose steps (IDegLira) or 50 units (degludec). The primary endpoint was change from baseline in HbA1c with IDegLira vs degludec after 26 weeks of treatment.

   RESULTS: In total, 210 Japanese individuals were randomized to IDegLira or degludec and completion rates were 100% and 93%, respectively. IDegLira was superior to degludec with respect to change from baseline in HbA1c: estimated treatment difference (ETD) (95% confidence interval), -13.98 mmol/Mol (-16.41; -11.55); P < 0.0001. The change in mean HbA1c was from 70.6 by -21.3 mmol/Mol with IDegLira and from 70.1 by -7.1 mmol/Mol with degludec. Mean change in body weight was -0.7 kg with IDegLira and 0.7 kg with degludec: ETD (95% CI) -1.41 kg (-2.26; -0.56); P = 0.0012. Mean daily total insulin dose was significantly lower with IDegLira (37.6 U) as compared to that with degludec (41.2 U) at Week 26. Overall rates of severe or blood glucose-confirmed hypoglycaemia and adverse events were comparable between treatment groups.

   CONCLUSIONS: IDegLira provided superior reductions in HbA1c compared with <=50 U degludec, with weight loss and similar hypoglycaemia rates and no unexpected safety or tolerability issues. These results suggest that this treatment could be an attractive intensification option for Japanese subjects with T2D that was uncontrolled with basal or pre-mixed insulin.

Abstract
  AIMS: Basal-bolus therapy is associated with greater treatment burden and lower adherence compared with more simplified regimens. This post hoc analysis studied the difference between insulin degludec/liraglutide (IDegLira) and basal-bolus therapy on number of injections, dose adjustments and patient outcomes in the DUAL VII trial.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: DUAL VII was a 26-week, open-label trial in which patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes who were using metformin and insulin glargine 100 units/mL (20-50 U) were randomized 1:1 to IDegLira (N = 252) or basal-bolus (insulin glargine U100 + insulin aspart <=4 times/day) (N = 254). This post hoc analysis reports the observed mean number of injections and cumulative dose adjustments during 26 weeks of treatment. Patient-reported outcomes (Treatment-Related Impact Measure - Diabetes [TRIM-D] and Short Form-36 Health Survey version 2 [SF-36v2]) were collected at scheduled visits and change from baseline scores calculated.

   RESULTS: The clinical benefits (non-inferior HbA1c reductions, weight benefit, less hypoglycaemia) of IDegLira vs basal-bolus therapy were achieved with fewer cumulative dose adjustments (16.6 vs 217.2, respectively) and fewer injections (1 vs >=3 per day, respectively). Patients treated with IDegLira experienced significant improvements across all TRIM-D domains compared with those undergoing basal-bolus therapy. The SF-36v2 showed improvements in both treatment arms with no significant difference between arms in the physical component summary, but there was a significant improvement in patients treated with IDegLira in the mental component summary (P = .0228).

   CONCLUSIONS: These findings, combined with the DUAL VII results, suggest that IDegLira, through a more simplified regimen versus basal-bolus therapy, may help improve patient adherence and improve patient outcomes related to diabetes management, treatment burden and mental health, which in turn may assist in the timely achievement of glycaemic control in clinical practice.

Abstract
  Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a major risk factor for developing cardiovascular disease, and many patients with diabetes have prevalent cardiovascular complications. Recent cardiovascular outcome clinical trials suggest that certain new glucose-lowering drugs are accompanied by additional cardioprotective properties. Indeed, selected glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists have a proved cardiovascular benefit in terms of a reduced incidence of ischaemic events, while sodium/glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors have also shown significant protection, with a striking effect on heart failure and renal endpoints. These findings have been integrated in recent guidelines which now recommend prescribing (when initial metformin monotherapy fails) a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist or a sodium/glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor with clinical trial-confirmed benefit in patients with diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and a sodium/glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor in such patients with heart failure or chronic kidney disease at initial stages. Furthermore, the new 2019 European Society of Cardiology guidelines in collaboration with the European Association for the Study of Diabetes recommend a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist or a sodium/glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor in treatment-naive patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with pre-existing cardiovascular disease or at high cardiovascular risk. Future research will disentangle the mechanisms underpinning these beneficial effects and will also establish to what extent these results are generalisable to the whole diabetes population. In the meantime, available evidence should prompt a wide diffusion of these two classes of drugs among patients with diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Here, we briefly summarise recent findings emerging from cardiovascular outcome clinical trials, discuss their impact on treatment algorithms and propose new possible approaches to improve our knowledge further regarding the cardiovascular effect of glucose-lowering medications.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Whey protein and guar gum have both been reported to reduce postprandial glycemia in health and type 2 diabetes, associated with stimulation of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and/or slowing of gastric emptying. Our aim was to evaluate, in type 2 diabetes, the acute effects of low dose "preloads" of whey and guar, given alone or in combination before a meal, on postprandial glycemia, insulin, GLP-1, and gastric emptying.

   METHODS: 21 patients with type 2 diabetes, managed by diet or metformin alone, were each studied on 4 days. They received a preload "shake" 15min before a mashed potato meal (368.5 kcal) labeled with 13C-octanoic-acid. The preloads comprised either (i) 17 g whey (W), (ii) 5 g guar (G), (iii) 17 g whey + 5 g guar (WG) each sweetened with 60 mg sucralose, and (iv) 60 mg sucralose alone (control; C), all dissolved in 150 mL water. Venous blood was sampled frequently for measurements of glucose, insulin, and GLP-1 concentrations. Gastric half-emptying time (T50) was calculated from breath 13CO2 excretion over 240 min.

   RESULTS: Postprandial blood glucose concentrations were lower with W and WG compared to C (each P < 0.0001, treatment x time interaction), and lower after G than C only at 30min. Insulin, GLP-1, and glucagon concentrations were higher after W than WG, G, or C (P < 0.05, treatment x time interaction), without differences between the latter three. Gastric emptying was slower with W (T50: 179.6 +/- 6.1 min, P < 0.05) and WG (T50: 197.6 +/- 9.7 min, P < 0.0001) when compared to C (T50: 162.9 +/- 6.2 min), but did not differ between G (T50: 171.3 +/- 7.0) and C (P > 0.99).

   CONCLUSION: Both whey and whey/guar preloads reduced postprandial glycemia, associated with slowing of gastric emptying. Low dose guar was less effective as a preload for glucose-lowering and did not slow gastric emptying.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether pretreatment with metformin (MET) is associated with less stroke severity and better outcome after IV thrombolysis (IVT), we analyzed a cohort of 1,919 patients with stroke with type 2 diabetes mellitus in a multicenter exploratory analysis.

   METHODS: Data from patients with diabetes and ischemic stroke treated with IVT were collected within the European Thrombolysis in Ischemic Stroke Patients (TRISP) collaboration. We applied propensity score matching (PSM) to obtain balanced baseline characteristics of patients treated with and without MET.

   RESULTS: Of 1,919 patients with stroke with type 2 diabetes who underwent IVT, 757 (39%) had received MET before stroke (MET+), whereas 1,162 (61%) had not (MET-). MET+ patients were younger with a male preponderance. Hypercholesterolemia and pretreatment with statins, antiplatelets, or antihypertensives were more common in the MET+ group. After PSM, the 2 groups were well balanced with respect to demographic and clinical aspects. Stroke severity on admission (NIH Stroke Scale 10.0 +/- 6.7 vs 11.3 +/- 6.5), 3-month degree of independence on modified Rankin Scale (2 [interquartile range (IQR) 1.0-4.0] vs 3 [IQR 1.0-4.0]), as well as mortality (12.5% vs 18%) were significantly lower in the MET+ group. The frequency of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhages did not differ between groups. HbA1c levels were well-balanced between the groups.

   CONCLUSIONS: Patients with stroke and diabetes on treatment with MET receiving IVT had less severe strokes on admission and a better functional outcome at 3 months. This suggests a protective effect of MET resulting in less severe strokes as well as beneficial thrombolysis outcome. Copyright © 2020 American Academy of Neurology.

Abstract
  AIMS: Metformin may have clinical benefits in dialysis patients; however, its safety in this population is unknown. This systematic review evaluated the safety of metformin in dialysis patients.

   METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Library were searched for randomised controlled trials and observational studies evaluating metformin use in dialysis patients. Three authors reviewed the studies and extracted data. The primary outcomes were mortality, occurrence of lactic acidosis and myocardial infarction (MI) in patients taking metformin during dialysis treatment for >=12 months (long term). Risk of bias was assessed using Risk Of Bias In Nonrandomised Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-1). Overall quality of evidence was assessed using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE).

   RESULTS: Fifteen observational studies were eligible; 7 were prospective observational studies and 8 were case reports/case series. No randomised controlled trials were identified. The 7 prospective observational studies (n = 194) reported on cautious metformin use in patients undergoing maintenance dialysis. Only 3 provided long-term follow-up data. In 2 long-term studies of metformin therapy (<=1000 mg/d) in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD), 1 reported 6 deaths (6/83; 7%) due to major cardiovascular events (3 MI) and the other reported no deaths (0/35). One long-term study of metformin therapy (250 mg to 500 mg thrice weekly) in patients undergoing haemodialysis reported 4 deaths (4/61; 7%) due to major cardiovascular events (2 MI). These findings provide very low-quality evidence as they come from small observational studies.

   CONCLUSION: The evidence regarding the safety of metformin in people undergoing dialysis is inconclusive. Appropriately designed randomised controlled trials are needed to resolve this uncertainty. Copyright © 2019 The British Pharmacological Society.

Abstract
  Dapagliflozin is associated with greater reductions in HbA1c and weight than saxagliptin in management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The present post hoc analyses compared the durability of these effects over short- and long-term follow-up in patients with T2DM who were inadequately controlled with metformin (>=1500 mg/day) and who were receiving either dapagliflozin (10 mg/day) or saxagliptin (5 mg/day). Failure of glycaemiccontrol was assessed using the slope of the change in HbA1c from baseline-over-time regression line (coefficient of failure [CoF]). CoF was compared directly (dapagliflozin vs saxagliptin) over the short term (NCT01606007, 24 weeks) and indirectly (placebo-adjusted) over the long term (NCT00528879 and NCT00121667, 102 weeks). A low CoF value indicated greater durability. CoF was lower for dapagliflozin versus saxagliptin over 18-24 weeks (-1.38%/year; 95% CI, -2.41 to -0.35; P = .009) and 20-102 weeks (-0.37%/year; 95% CI, -0.73 to -0.02; P = .04). Fewer dapagliflozin-treated patients versus saxagliptin-treated patients required rescue medication or discontinued the study because of failure to achieve glycaemic control at 24 weeks (3.4% vs 9.4%; P = .0191). In patients with T2DM who were inadequately controlled with metformin, dapagliflozin was associated with greater durability of glycaemic control than saxagliptin over 18-24 and 20-102 weeks.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To compare diabetic kidney disease (DKD) rates over 5 years of follow-up in two cohorts of severely obese adolescents with type 2 diabetes (T2D) undergoing medical or surgical treatment for T2D.

   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A secondary analysis was performed of data collected from obese participants of similar age and racial distribution enrolled in the Teen-Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery (Teen-LABS) and the Treatment Options of Type 2 Diabetes in Adolescents and Youth (TODAY) studies. Teen-LABS participants underwent metabolic bariatric surgery (MBS). TODAY participants were randomized to metformin alone or in combination with rosiglitazone or intensive lifestyle intervention, with insulin therapy given for glycemic progression. Glycemic control, BMI, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), urinary albumin excretion (UAE), and prevalence of hyperfiltration (eGFR >=135 mL/min/1.73 m2) and elevated UAE (>=30 mg/g) were assessed annually.

   RESULTS: Participants with T2D from Teen-LABS (n = 30, mean +/- SD age, 16.9 +/- 1.3 years; 70% female; 60% white; BMI 54.4 +/- 9.5 kg/m2) and TODAY (n = 63, age 15.3 +/- 1.3 years; 56% female; 71% white; BMI 40.5 +/- 4.9 kg/m2) were compared. During 5 years of follow-up, hyperfiltration decreased from 21% to 18% in Teen-LABS and increased from 7% to 48% in TODAY. Elevated UAE decreased from 27% to 5% in Teen-LABS and increased from 21% to 43% in TODAY. Adjusting for baseline age, sex, BMI, and HbA1c, TODAY participants had a greater odds of hyperfiltration (odds ratio 15.7 [95% CI 2.6, 94.3]) and elevated UAE (27.3 [4.9, 149.9]) at 5 years of follow-up.

   CONCLUSIONS: Compared with MBS, medical treatment of obese youth with T2D was associated with a higher odds of DKD over 5 years. Copyright © 2019 by the American Diabetes Association.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: Impaired insulin sensitivity is associated with hyperfiltration (i.e., elevated glomerular filtration rate [GFR]) in adolescents with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and adults with prediabetes. Yet, these relationships are based on studies that relied on estimated GFR (eGFR), estimates of insulin sensitivity, or both. We aimed to verify the relationship between insulin sensitivity and renal hemodynamic function by gold standard methods in adults with T2D.

   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Insulin sensitivity was assessed by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (M value) (glucose infusion rate in mg/kglean/min) and renal hemodynamic function by urinary inulin (GFR) and para-aminohippuric acid (effective renal plasma flow [ERPF]) clearances in participants with T2D without overt kidney disease. Filtration fraction (FF) (GFR/ERPF) was calculated. Relationships between insulin sensitivity and renal hemodynamic parameters were examined by multivariable linear regression. Renal hemodynamic parameters were examined across tertiles of M values.

   RESULTS: We tested 44 adults with T2D, of whom 77% were male, with mean +/- SD age 63 +/- 7 years, BMI 31.2 +/- 4.0 kg/m2, and HbA1c 7.4 +/- 0.6%. Average GFR was 110 +/- 26 mL/min, with an FF of 22.1 +/- 2.8% and median 24-h urinary albumin excretion of 11.3 mg (interquartile range 5.8-17.0). Average M value was 5.6 +/- 2.9 mg/kglean/min. Insulin sensitivity inversely correlated with GFR (r = -0.44, P < 0.01) and FF (r = -0.40, P < 0.01), and these associations remained significant after multivariable adjustments for age, sex, renin-angiotensin system inhibitor use, and HbA1c. In addition, GFR, FF, and urinary albumin excretion were highest in the participants in the lowest M value tertile.

   CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, we demonstrate that impaired insulin sensitivity is associated with intrarenal hemodynamic dysfunction by gold standard techniques in adults with T2D treated with metformin monotherapy. Copyright © 2019 by the American Diabetes Association.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Increased risk and cancer-related mortality is observed in pancreatic cancer (PC) patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). Whether using metformin as glucose-lowering therapy can result in survival benefit in this group of patients is still unclear.

   METHODS: A meta-analysis of 21 studies that including 38,772 patients was performed to investigate the association between metformin and overall survival in patients with PC and concurrent DM.

   RESULTS: A significant survival benefit was observed in metformin treatment group compared with non-metformin group (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.83, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.74-0.91). These associations were observed in both subgroups of Asian countries (HR = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.60-0.79) and Western countries (HR = 0.86, 95% CI: 0.76-0.95), the former was more obvious. Survival benefit was gained for patients at early stage (HR = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.64-0.85) and mixed stage (HR = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.70-0.91), but not for patients at advanced stage (HR = 0.99, 95% CI: 0.74-1.24). Similarly, survival benefit was also observed in patients receiving surgery (HR = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.69-0.94) and comprehensive treatment (HR = 0.85, 95% CI: 0.77-0.93), but not in chemotherapy group (HR = 0.99, 95% CI: 0.67-1.30). No obvious benefit was suggested when pooled by time-varying COX model (HR = 0.94, 95% CI: 0.86-1.03).

   CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that metformin is associated with survival benefit in patients with PC and concurrent DM. Further randomized controlled trials and prospective studies with larger sample sizes are required to confirm our findings.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors have been suggested to have pancreatic beta-cell preserving effect according to studies using homeostatic model of assessment for beta-cell function (HOMA-beta). However, whether HOMA-beta is a suitable biomarker for comparisons between hypoglycemic drugs with different mechanisms of action remains unclear. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to compare the effects of DPP-4 inhibitors and other classes of hypoglycemic drugs on HOMA-beta and proinsulin-to-insulin ratio (PIR).

   METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, CENTRAL, and Ichushi-web for the period of 1966 to May 2020. We collected randomized, controlled clinical trials in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus comparing DPP-4 inhibitors and other classes of hypoglycemic agents [alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (alpha-GIs), glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogues, metformin, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, sulfonylureas, or thiazolidinediones]. Weighted mean differences and 95% confidence intervals of changes in HOMA-beta or PIR during study periods were calculated for pairwise comparisons.

   RESULTS: Thirty-seven and 21 relevant trials were retrieved for comparisons of HOMA-beta and PIR, respectively. HOMA-beta and PIR consistently showed superiority of DPP-4 inhibitors compared with alpha-GIs. Both biomarkers consistently supported inferiority of DPP-4 inhibitors compared with GLP-1 analogues. However, PIR showed inferiority of DPP-4 inhibitors compared with metformin, and superiority compared with SGLT2 inhibitors, whereas HOMA-beta showed no significant differences between DPP-4 inhibitors and the two other agents.

   CONCLUSION: DPP-4 inhibitors appear to be superior to alpha-GIs but inferior to GLP-1 analogues in preservation of beta-cell function assessed by either HOMA-beta or PIR. DPP-4 inhibitors seem to be superior to SGLT2 inhibitors but inferior to metformin on islet function assessed only by PIR. Because HOMA-beta and PIR may indicate different aspects of beta-cell function, results of beta-cell function preserving effects of hypoglycemic agents should be interpreted with caution.

Abstract
  AIMS: This study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of generic exenatide with branded exenatide Byetta R in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) inadequately controlled on monotherapy or combination therapy of metformin and insulin secretagogues.

   METHODS: A multicenter, randomized, controlled, non-inferiority trial was performed. A total of 240 patients with T2DM and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) >= 7% (53 mmol/mol) to <= 9.0% (75 mmol/mol) on monotherapy or combination therapy of metformin and insulin secretagogues for at least 3 months were randomized into generic exenatide or branded exenatide groups with a 1:1 ratio for 16 weeks of treatment. The primary endpoint was the change in HbA1c levels from baseline at week 16, with a non-inferiority margin of - 0.35% (- 3.83 mmol/mol) (lower bound of one-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) > - 0.35% (- 3.83 mmol/mol)). Secondary endpoints included the proportion of participants achieving HbA1c < 7% (53 mmol/mol), the changes in fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2-h postprandial glucose (2hPG) following a standard meal, 7-point self-monitoring blood glucose (SMBG) profiles, body weight change from baseline at week 16 and the change in HbA1c levels from baseline at week 8. Safety issues were also evaluated.

   RESULTS: After 16 weeks of treatment, HbA1c levels decreased significantly from baseline in the two groups, with a reduction of - 1.10% +/- 1.31% (- 12.0 mmol/mol +/- 14.3 mmol/mol) in the generic exenatide group and - 1.08% +/- 1.11% (- 11.8 mmol/mol +/- 12.1 mmol/mol) in the branded exenatide group (both P < 0.001). The least-squares mean difference of HbA1c reduction between the two groups was - 0.03% (- 0.33 mmol/mol), with a lower one-sided 95% CI limit of - 0.27% (- 2.95 mmol/mol), which was higher than the prespecified non-inferiority margin of - 0.35% (- 3.83 mmol/mol). Moreover, there were no significant differences in the proportion of participants achieving HbA1c < 7% (53 mmol/mol) and the changes in FPG, 2hPG, 7-point SMBG profiles and body weight at week 16 and the change in HbA1c levels from baseline at week 8 (all P > 0.05) between the two groups. The incidence of adverse events, including the incidence of hypoglycemia (18.3% and 17.5%, respectively), was similar for the generic and branded exenatide groups (P > 0.05).

   CONCLUSIONS: In patients with T2DM inadequately controlled on monotherapy or combination therapy of metformin and insulin secretagogues, add-on treatment with generic exenatide demonstrated non-inferiority to branded exenatide in terms of improvements in HbA1c after 16 weeks of treatment. Furthermore, the two drugs were also similar for other efficacy endpoints and safety profile. Trial registration Chinese Clinical Trial Registry: ChiCTR-IPR-15006558, Date registered May 27, 2015.

Abstract
  Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) modulates inflammation by enzymatic cleavage of immunoregulatory peptides and through its soluble form (sDPP4) that directly engages immune cells. Here we examine whether reduction of DPP4 activity alters inflammation. Prolonged DPP4 inhibition increases plasma levels of sDPP4, and induces sDPP4 expression in lymphocyte-enriched organs in mice. Bone marrow transplantation experiments identify hematopoietic cells as the predominant source of plasma sDPP4 following catalytic DPP4 inhibition. Surprisingly, systemic DPP4 inhibition increases plasma levels of inflammatory markers in regular chow-fed but not in high fat-fed mice. Plasma levels of sDPP4 and biomarkers of inflammation are lower in metformin-treated subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular disease, yet exhibit considerable inter-individual variation. Sitagliptin therapy for 12 months reduces DPP4 activity yet does not increase markers of inflammation or levels of sDPP4. Collectively our findings dissociate levels of DPP4 enzyme activity, sDPP4 and biomarkers of inflammation in mice and humans.

Abstract
  AIMS: The Glycemia Reduction Approaches in Diabetes - A Comparative Effectiveness (GRADE) trial is a randomized clinical trial comparing glycemic effects of four diabetes medications added to metformin in type 2 diabetes (T2D). Microvascular and macrovascular diseases are secondary outcomes. We evaluated the prevalence and risk factor relationships for microvascular and macrovascular complications in the GRADE cohort at study entry.

   METHODS: Complication prevalence and risk factors were analyzed based on data from screening in all consenting participants meeting GRADE eligibility. Logistic regression and Z-statistics were used to assess risk factor relationships with complications.

   RESULTS: We enrolled 5047 T2D participants [mean age 57years; 36% female; mean known T2D duration 4years (all<10years); mean HbA1c 8.0% (~64mmol/mol) at screening]. Urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR)>=30mg/gram was present in 15.9% participants; peripheral neuropathy (by Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument) in 21.5%; cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy by electrocardiography-derived indices in 9.7%; self-reported retinopathy in 1.0%. Myocardial infarction ascertained by self-report or electrocardiogram was present in 7.3%, and self-reported history of stroke in 2.0%.

   CONCLUSIONS: In the GRADE cohort with<10years of T2D and a mean HbA1c of 8.0%, diabetes complications were present in a substantial fraction of participants, more so than might otherwise have been expected. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  In this post hoc analysis of the randomized controlled LixiLan-O trial in insulin-naive patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) not controlled with metformin, with or without a second oral antihyperglycaemic drug (OAD), the efficacy and safety of the fixed-ratio combination, iGlarLixi (insulin glargine 100 U [iGlar] and lixisenatide [Lixi]), compared to its individual components was assessed in two patient subgroups: group 1) baseline HbA1c >=9% (n = 134); group 2) inadequate control (HbA1c >=7.0% and <=9.0%) despite administration of two OADs at screening (n = 725). Treatment with iGlarLixi resulted in significantly greater reduction in least squares mean HbA1c compared to treatment with iGlar or Lixi alone in both subgroups (group 1: 2.9%, 2.5%, 1.7% and group 2: 1.5%, 1.2%, 0.7%, respectively). Target HbA1c less than 7% was achieved in more than 70% of patients using iGlarLixi in both subgroups, while mitigating the weight gain observed with use of iGlar alone. Rates of hypoglycaemic events were low overall. These results suggest that treatment with iGlarLixi achieves superior glycaemic control compared to treatment with iGlar or Lixi alone in T2DM patients with HbA1c >=9% or in those inadequately controlled with two OADs.

Abstract
  Elevated levels of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) play a role in insulin resistance, impaired beta-cell function and they are a denominator of the abnormal atherogenic lipid profile that characterizes obese patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). We hypothesized that the GLP-1 receptor agonist liraglutide, in combination with metformin, would reduce lipolysis. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial, 41 T2DM patients with coronary artery disease were randomized and treated with liraglutide-metformin vs placebo-metformin during 12- + 12-week periods with a wash-out period of at least 2 weeks before and between the intervention periods. NEFA kinetics were estimated using the Boston Minimal Model of NEFA metabolism, with plasma NEFA and glucose levels measured during a standard 180-minute frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test. Liraglutide-metformin reduced estimates of lipolysis. Furthermore, placebo-metformin increased estimates of lipid oxidation, while treatment with liraglutide eliminated this effect. We conclude that liraglutide exerts a clinically relevant reduction in estimates of lipolysis and lipid oxidation which is explained, in part, by improved insulin secretion, as revealed by an intravenous glucose tolerance test.

Abstract
  A prospective, multicentre, open-label, blinded-endpoint, randomized controlled study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of treatment with ipragliflozin (sodium-dependent glucose transporter-2 inhibitor) versus metformin for visceral fat reduction and glycaemic control among Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes treated with sitagliptin, HbA1c levels of 7%-10%, and body mass index (BMI) >= 22 kg/m2 . Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive ipragliflozin 50 mg or metformin 1000-1500 mg daily. The primary outcome was change in visceral fat area as measured by computed tomography after 24 weeks of therapy. The secondary outcomes were effects on glucose metabolism and lipid metabolism. Mean percentage reduction in visceral fat area was significantly greater in the ipragliflozin group than in the metformin group (-12.06% vs. -3.65%, P = 0.040). Ipragliflozin also significantly reduced BMI, subcutaneous fat area, waist circumference, fasting insulin, and homeostatic model assessment (HOMA)-resistance, and increased HDL-cholesterol levels. Metformin significantly reduced HbA1c and LDL-cholesterol levels and increased HOMA-beta. There were no severe adverse events. The use of ipragliflozin or metformin in combination with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, widely used in Japan, may have beneficial effects in ameliorating multiple cardiovascular risk factors.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) thickness is a marker of visceral fat and an emerging therapeutic target. Dapagliflozin, a selective sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, improves glucose control and induces moderate weight loss in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Dapagliflozin has recently been shown to reduce cardiovascular risk. Nevertheless, whether dapagliflozin could reduce EAT thickness is unknown.

   METHODS: This hypothesis was tested in a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in 100 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with BMI >= 27 kg/m2 and a hemoglobin A1c level <= 8% on metformin monotherapy. Individuals were randomly assigned to 2 groups to receive additional dapagliflozin up to 10 mg once daily or to remain on metformin up to 1,000 mg twice daily. Ultrasound-measured EAT thickness was measured at baseline, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks.

   RESULTS: In the dapagliflozin group, EAT decreased by 20% from baseline to 24 weeks, by 15% after 12 weeks, and by 7% between 12 and 24 weeks, respectively (P < 0.01 for all), whereas in the metformin group, there was a significant but smaller EAT reduction. There was no statistically significant correlation between EAT and body weight changes.

   CONCLUSIONS: Dapagliflozin causes a rapid and significant EAT reduction that could be independent of weight loss. Copyright © 2020 The Obesity Society.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND AND AIM: Inflammatory and methylation imbalances occur in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The aim of the present study was to analyze the effect of acute resistance exercise on the inflammatory profile and on DNA methylation of elderly patients with T2DM using metformin.

   METHODS: For this purpose, we enrolled 22 male and female older adults (68.2 +/- 5.3 years), of whom 13 had controlled T2DM (D) under metformin use and 9 were nondiabetics (ND). All subjects underwent a neuromuscular circuit (8 exercises in 40 min, with each exercise performed in 3 sets of 40 s each and a 20-s interval between repetitions).

   RESULTS: The main results indicated a significant difference between groups for baseline interleukin (IL)-10, with a higher concentration in the D group compared to the ND group (p = 0.019). An increase in IL-6 concentration after intervention was observed in group D (p = 0.035). No effect was observed in total DNA methylation within or between groups.

   CONCLUSIONS: The resistance training protocol applied in this study modulates the IL-10 and IL-6 concentrations in elderly people with T2DM and under metformin use, possibly as a result of physiological adaptations, with no effect on nondiabetic elderly. No effects on absolute levels of DNA methylation were observed. Copyright © 2019 S. Karger AG, Basel.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the safety and efficacy of RVT-1502, a novel oral glucagon receptor antagonist, in subjects with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin.

   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In a phase 2, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study, subjects with type 2 diabetes (n = 166) on a stable dose of metformin were randomized (1:1:1:1) to placebo or RVT-1502 5, 10, or 15 mg once daily for 12 weeks. The primary end point was change from baseline in HbA1c for each dose of RVT-1502 compared with placebo. Secondary end points included change from baseline in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and safety assessments.

   RESULTS: Over 12 weeks, RVT-1502 significantly reduced HbA1c relative to placebo by 0.74%, 0.76%, and 1.05% in the 5-, 10-, and 15-mg groups (P < 0.001), respectively, and FPG decreased by 2.1, 2.2, and 2.6 mmol/L (P < 0.001). The proportions of subjects achieving an HbA1c <7.0% were 19.5%, 39.5%, 39.5%, and 45.0% with placebo and RVT-1502 5, 10, and 15 mg (P <= 0.02 vs. placebo). The frequency of hypoglycemia was low, and no episodes were severe. Mild increases in mean aminotransferase levels remaining below the upper limit of normal were observed with RVT-1502 but were reversible and did not appear to be dose related, with no other liver parameter changes. Weight and lipid changes were similar between RVT-1502 and placebo. RVT-1502-associated mild increases in blood pressure were not dose related or consistent across time.

   CONCLUSIONS: Glucagon receptor antagonism with RVT-1502 significantly lowers HbA1c and FPG, with a safety profile that supports further clinical development with longer-duration studies (NCT02851849). Copyright © 2019 by the American Diabetes Association.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Dementia is more prevalent among people with type 2 diabetes, but little is known regarding the influence of antidiabetic agents on this association.

   OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the impact of various antidiabetic agents on the risk of dementia among patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus.

   METHODS: Relevant studies were retrieved from the PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and ClinicalTrials.gov databases. Nine antidiabetic agents were included in the search. Data were pooled via network meta-analysis and meta-analysis.

   RESULTS: Nine studies were selected for the network meta-analysis with 530,355 individuals and 17 studies for the meta-analysis with 1,258,879 individuals. The analysis excluded glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) analogs and sodium-dependent glucose transporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors due to the absence of relevant data. The use of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, metformin, thiazolidinedione, and sulfonylurea was associated with a decreased risk of dementia in comparison to no treatment with antidiabetic agents (hazard ratio [HR] for DPP-4 inhibitors, 0.54; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.38-0.74, HR for metformin, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.63-0.86; HR for sulfonylurea, 0.85; 95%CI, 0.73-0.98 and HR for thiazolidinedione, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.55-0.89, respectively). However, the node-splitting analysis showed the inconsistency of direct and indirect estimates in sulfonylurea (P=0.042). DPP-4 inhibitors, metformin, thiazolidinedione, and sulfonylurea exhibited a significant impact on the risk of dementia in diabetics compared with insulin (HR, 0.35; 95%CI, 0.20-0.59, HR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.30-0.77, HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.29-0.73 and HR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.34-0.88, respectively). DPP-4 inhibitors also exhibited a protective effect on the risk of Alzheimer's dementia compared with the no treatment with antidiabetic agents (HR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.25-0.92). The meta-analysis demonstrated a protective effect of using metformin and DPP-4 inhibitors on the risk of dementia (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.74-1.00 and HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.55-0.76, respectively). Further analysis showed insulin was associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's dementia (HR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.13-2.26). Only two case-control studies mentioned GLP-1 analogs and SGLT-2 inhibitors, and the pooled ORs showed no evidence of an association with dementia (GLP-1 analogs: 0.71; 95% CI, 0.46-1.10 and SGLT-2 inhibitors: 0.74; 95% CI, 0.47-1.15).

   CONCLUSION: This analysis indicated that patients with type 2 diabetes under treatment with DPP-4 inhibitors presented with the lowest risk of dementia, followed by those treated with metformin and thiazolidinedione, while treatment with insulin was associated with the highest risk. For the increasing focus on the protective effect on dementia, further specific clinical studies are needed to evaluate the impact of GLP-1 analogs and SGLT-2 inhibitors on the risk of dementia.

Abstract
  Objective: Medication adherence is impacted by regimen complexity. The SIMPLE (Simple basal Insulin titration, Metformin Plus Liraglutide for type 2 diabetes with very Elevated HbA1c) study compared GLP1RA plus basal insulin (GLP1RA+BI) to basal-bolus insulin (BBI) regimen in participants with very uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This analysis aimed to evaluate medication adherence to GLP1RA+BI compared with BBI, the effect of adherence on clinical and patient-reported outcomes, and baseline predictors of adherence.

   Research design and methods: This was an analysis of the SIMPLE study based on prespecified outcome. The study took place in pragmatic, real-world setting. A total of 120 adults with T2DM and HgbA1c>=10% were randomized to detemir plus liraglutide, or detemir plus aspart before each meal; 6-month follow-up. The main outcomes evaluated were: adherence, HgbA1c, weight, quality of life, and hypoglycemia. Adherence rate was calculated for each study medication at each follow-up visit; participants were classified as >=80% or <80% adherent.

   Result: A higher percentage of participants in the GLP1RA+BI compared with the BBI group had >=80% adherence to detemir (59.3% vs 35.7%, p=0.02) as well as liraglutide versus aspart (57.4% vs 30.4%, p=0.007). Higher age was predictive of >=80% adherence (OR per 5-year increment=1.48, 95% CI 1.09 to 2.0, p=0.01). Higher adherence led to greater improvement in HbA1c and weight in both groups. Treatment with GLP1RA+BI compared with BBI led to greater improvement in HbA1c, weight, and quality of life and lower risk of hypoglycemia even after adjusting for the difference in adherence between groups.

   Conclusions: Adherence was higher with the simplified regimen of GLP1RA+BI compared with BBI. Greater adherence to the simpler regimen amplified the treatment effect on HbA1c, weight, quality of life, and risk of hypoglycemia, yet statistically significant greater benefits were noted even when adjusted for adherence.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: At present, metformin is mainly used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). When the therapeutic effect is achieved, there are side effects and secondary failure will occur if taken for a long time. It is of great significance to actively explore the clinical scheme of reducing drug use while ensuring the therapeutic effect of T2DM.

   OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility of Chinese massage (CM) in the treatment of T2DM.

   METHODS: Literature retrieval is divided into 2 aspects: Electronic Retrieval and Personal Check. We will search PubMed, EMBASE, CNKI, Cochrane Central, which were registered in international clinical trials registry platform systems, select all eligible studies published before November 2, 2019, and use Personal Check method to retrieve papers, conference papers, ongoing experiments, internal reports, and so on. With fasting blood glucose, 2-hour fasting blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, and insulin index as the main observation indexes, we also pay attention to traditional Chinese medicine syndrome score scale, insulin resisting index, body mass index , serum total cholesterol, Curative effect and the occurrence of all adverse reactions in drug treatment.Of the research group 2 researchers respective selected literature, extracted data, and evaluated the risk of bias. After that we used Revman 5.7 and Stata 12.1 statistical software for meta-analysis.

   RESULTS: A total of 769 subjects were included in 10 studies for meta-analysis. Compared with metformin hydrochloride tablets, CM plus baseline treatment can reduce fasting plasma glucose (weighted mean difference [WMD] = -0.33, 95% confidence interval [CI] [-0.54, -0.13], Z = 3.15, P = .002), 2 hours postprandial blood glucose (WMD = -0.52, 95% CI [-0.70, -0.34), Z = 5.66, P < .00001], hemoglobin A1c (WMD = 0.12, 95% CI [0.04, 0.20], Z = 2.94, P = .003), fasting insulin (WMD = -3.59, 95% CI [-5.56, -1.42], Z = 10.29,P < .00001), traditional Chinese medicine syndrome score scale (WMD = -4.55, 95% CI [-7.58, -1.51], Z = 2.94, P = .003),homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (WMD = -1.76, 95% CI [-2.25, -1.27), Z = 7.08, P < .00001),body mass index (WMD = -1.28, 95% CI [-1.65, -0.92], Z = 6.91, P < .00001), serum total cholesterol (WMD = -1.01, 95% CI [-1.14, -0.83], Z = 15.51, P < .00001), meanwhile, the effective rate was increased (risk ratio [RR] = 1.31, 95% CI [1.21, 1.42], Z = 6.57, P < .00001).

   CONCLUSION: CM combined with metformin hydrochloride tablet has a synergistic effect. It can not only be used as an auxiliary treatment of T2DM, but also as an important reference way of reducing drug treatment of T2DM, improving Clinical Efficacy and reducing adverse reactions.

Abstract
  AIM: To compare the relative safety and effectiveness of bexagliflozin and sitagliptin as adjuncts to metformin for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes.

   METHODS: Participants (n = 386) were randomized to receive bexagliflozin (20 mg) or sitagliptin (100 mg) in addition to their existing doses of metformin. The primary endpoint was the non-inferiority of bexagliflozin to sitagliptin for change in HbA1c from baseline to week 24. Changes from baseline to week 24 in fasting plasma glucose (FPG), body mass (in subjects with baseline body mass index >=25 kg m-2 ) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) were secondary endpoints.

   RESULTS: The mean change from baseline to week 24 in HbA1c was -0.74 (95% CI -0.86%, -0.62%) in the bexagliflozin arm and -0.82% (95% CI -0.93%, -0.71%) in the sitagliptin arm, establishing non-inferiority. The changes from baseline FPG, body mass and SBP were -1.82 mmol L-1 , -3.35 kg and -4.23 mmHg in the bexagliflozin arm and -1.45 mmol L-1 , -0.81 kg and -1.90 mmHg in the sitagliptin arm, respectively. These differences were significant for the first two measures (one-sided P = 0.0123, P < 0.0001 and P = 0.0276, respectively.) Adverse events were experienced by 47.1% of subjects in the bexagliflozin arm and 56.0% of subjects taking sitagliptin. Serious adverse events affected 3.7% of subjects in the bexagliflozin arm and 2.1% of subjects in the sitagliptin arm.

   CONCLUSIONS: Bexagliflozin was non-inferior to sitagliptin and provided benefits over sitagliptin in FPG and body mass. Adverse event incidences in the two arms were similar. Copyright © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Abstract
  AIMS: To ensure the integrity of the planned analyses and maximize the clinical utility of the VERIFY study results by describing the detailed concepts behind its statistical analysis plan (SAP) before completion of data collection and study database lock. The SAP will be adhered to for the final primary data analysis of the VERIFY trial.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Vildagliptin efficacy in combination with metformin for early treatment of T2DM (VERIFY) is an ongoing, multicentre, randomized controlled trial aiming to demonstrate the clinical benefits of glycaemic durability and glucose control achieved with an early combination therapy in newly-diagnosed type 2 diabetes (T2DM) patients.

   RESULTS: The SAP was initially designed at the study protocol conception phase and later modified, as reported here, in collaboration between the steering committee members, statisticians, and the VERIFY study leadership team. All authors were blinded to treatment allocation. An independent statistician has additionally retrieved and presented unblinded data to the independent data safety monitoring committee. An overview of the trial design with a focus on describing the fine-tuning of the analysis plan for the primary efficacy endpoint, risk of initial treatment failure, and secondary, exploratory and pre-specified subgroup analyses is provided here.

   CONCLUSION: According to optimal trial practice, the details of the statistical analysis and data-handling plan prior to locking the database are reported here. The SAP accords with high-quality standards of internal validity to minimize analysis bias and will enhance the utility of the reported results for improved outcomes in the management of T2DM.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND & AIMS: Whether vitamin D affects lipid profile and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk is controversial. We evaluated the effect of oral daily vitamin D supplementation on lipid profile and CVD risk in patients with well-controlled type 2 diabetes.

   METHODS: Secondary analysis in the vitamin D for established type 2 diabetes (DDM2) study, a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial. 127 patients (mean age 60 years) with stable (HbA1c <= 7.5%) diabetes managed with lifestyle only or lifestyle plus metformin were randomized to receive 4000 IU/day of vitamin D3 (n = 66) or placebo (n = 61) for 48 weeks. Changes in lipid profile (total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides [TG] and TG/HDL ratio), C-reactive protein and CVD risk (calculated according the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association [ACC/AHA] guidelines) were assessed at week 24 and 48.

   RESULTS: The mean [+/-SEM] plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] level was higher in the vitamin D vs. the placebo group (20.5 +/- 1.18 vs. -1.6 +/- 1.2 ng/mL respectively; p < 0.001). There was no statistically significant change in lipid profile, C-reactive protein or CVD risk. Among patients who were not on cholesterol medication (n = 32), vitamin D supplementation reduced TG compared to placebo at week 48 (-18.74 +/- 8.91 vs. 9.69 +/- 8.60 mg/dL respectively; p = 0.032).

   CONCLUSION: One year supplementation with vitamin D3 at 4000 IU/day did not affect lipid profile, C-reactive protein and CVD risk in patients with stable type 2 diabetes not selected for vitamin D deficiency, with the exception of improvement of TG among patients not on cholesterol medication.

Abstract
  Objective: The purpose of this article is to review the pharmacological characteristics and clinical evidence of oral semaglutide for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Data Sources: A MEDLINE/PubMed search was conducted between January 1, 2005, and September 30, 2019. Search terms included semaglutide, glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist, GLP-1 receptor agonist, and type 2 diabetes. Study Selection and Data Extraction Quantification: The following study designs were included in the analysis: systematic review and/or meta-analyses, clinical trial, or observational study design. Narrative reviews were excluded. Articles were included only if they were published in the English language or evaluated oral semaglutide with regard to pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy in humans. Data Synthesis: Oral semaglutide has been Food and Drug Administration approved for the treatment of T2DM as an adjunct to diet and exercise. Oral semaglutide has been shown to result in an absolute hemoglobin A1C reduction between -0.5% and -1.5% and weight reductions between -1 and -4.7 kg. Oral semaglutide has been shown to be noninferior to placebo for cardiovascular (CV) safety although additional CV outcomes trials are ongoing. Adverse effects appear to be similar to those of other glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and are gastrointestinal in nature. Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice: Oral semaglutide may be appropriate as second- or third-line add-on therapy for patients with T2DM who are not meeting treatment goals on metformin and are overweight and reluctant to use an injectable drug. Conclusions: Oral semaglutide appears safe and effective as monotherapy and add-on pharmacological therapy for the treatment of T2DM.

Abstract
  AIM: To evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of ertugliflozin in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus inadequately controlled on metformin.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 104-week Phase III, randomized double-blind study with a 26-week placebo-controlled period (Phase A) and a 78-week period (Phase B) where blinded glimepiride was added to non-rescued placebo participants with fasting fingerstick glucose >=6.1 mmol/L. Results through week 104 are reported.

   RESULTS: Mean (standard error) change in HbA1c from baseline was -0.7% (0.07) and -1.0% (0.07) at week 52; -0.6% (0.08) and -0.9% (0.08) at week 104 for ertugliflozin 5 and 15 mg. At week 52, 34.8% and 36.6% participants had HbA1c <7.0%, and 24.6% and 33.7% at week 104, for ertugliflozin 5 and 15 mg. Ertugliflozin reduced fasting plasma glucose (FPG), body weight and systolic blood pressure (SBP) from baseline through week 104. The incidence of female genital mycotic infections (GMIs) was higher with ertugliflozin, and symptomatic hypoglycaemia was lower for ertugliflozin versus placebo/glimepiride. Minimal bone mineral density (BMD) changes were observed, similar to placebo/glimepiride, except at total hip where reduction in BMD was greater with ertugliflozin 15 mg versus placebo/glimepiride: difference in least squares means (95% CI) -0.50% (-0.95, -0.04) at week 52 and -0.84% (-1.44, -0.24) at week 104.

   CONCLUSIONS: Ertugliflozin maintained improvements from baseline in HbA1c, FPG, body weight and SBP through week 104. Ertugliflozin was well tolerated, with non-clinically relevant changes in BMD. Compared with placebo/glimepiride, ertugliflozin increased female GMIs, but reduced the incidence of symptomatic hypoglycaemia. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02033889.

Abstract
  AIM: To evaluate the long-term cost-effectiveness of an intensification strategy with sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors (pathway 1) compared with NPH insulin (pathway 2) in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) in the United Kingdom who were not at goal on metformin and sitagliptin.

   METHODS: Cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using the well-established, validated IQVIA CORE Diabetes Model from the payer perspective over a patient's lifetime. Randomized clinical trials informed treatment effect measures, while public or published sources informed economic inputs. Scenario analyses of glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), hypoglycaemia rate, body mass index effects, SGLT2 inhibitor cardiovascular protective effects, and population characteristics were conducted to assess the robustness of results.

   RESULTS: Pathway 1 increased life-years and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) compared with pathway 2 (13.49 vs. 13.37, and 9.40 vs. 9.22, respectively). Additional drug costs in pathway 1 were offset by diabetes-related complication decreases, leading to slightly lower direct medical costs for pathway 1 (25747 vs 26095). Pathway 1 was therefore cost-neutral (no interpretable incremental cost-effectiveness ratio), while improving clinical outcomes. Scenario analyses consistently showed cost-neutrality or cost-effectiveness of pathway 1. The highest result remained less than 3000/QALY, reflecting older patients (>=65 years) with lower baseline HbA1c (7%).

   CONCLUSIONS: For UK patients with T2D not at goal on metformin and sitagliptin therapy, treatment intensification with SGLT2 inhibitors prior to NPH insulin is cost-neutral or cost-effective compared with immediate NPH insulin intensification. Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Abstract
  AIMS: To compare the efficacy and safety of saxagliptin and glimepiride in type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients who are inadequately controlled with metformin monotherapy.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this 48-week, multi-centre, open-label, randomized, parallel trial (NCT02280486, clinicaltrials.gov), a total of 388 T2D patients were randomized 1:1 to saxagliptin or glimepiride groups. The primary endpoint was achievement of HbA1c <7.0%, without hypoglycaemia, defined as blood glucose <3.9 mmol/L and weight gain <3.0% after 48 weeks of treatment.

   RESULTS: Over 48 weeks, a greater proportion of patients achieved the primary endpoint with saxagliptin compared with glimepiride (43.3% vs 31.3%; odds ratio, 1.38, 95% CI, 1.05-1.82; P = 0.019), especially among patients with baseline HbA1c <8.0%, duration <5 years or baseline BMI >=25 kg/m2 . Mean reduction in HbA1c was similar in the two treatment groups at Week 48 (-0.94% with saxagliptin vs -0.98% with glimepiride; P = 0.439). Bodyweight decreased with saxagliptin, but increased with glimepiride over the treatment period, and the treatment difference was -1.6 kg (P < 0.001) at Week 48. The proportion of patients experiencing hypoglycaemia was much lower with saxagliptin vs glimepiride (3.1% vs 12.8%; P < 0.001).

   CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that, compared to glimepiride, saxagliptin more effectively achieves a composite endpoint of adequate glycaemic control without hypoglycaemia and without weight gain in T2D patients who are inadequately controlled with metformin monotherapy, especially in overweight patients with moderate hyperglycaemia and a relatively short duration of diabetes.

Abstract
  AIMS: To evaluate the effects of 12 weeks of treatment with a whey/guar preload on gastric emptying, postprandial glycaemia and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels in people with type 2 diabetes (T2DM).

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 79 people with T2DM, managed on diet or metformin (HbA1c 49 +/- 0.7 mmol/mol [6.6 +/- 0.1%]), were randomized, in single-blind fashion, to receive 150 mL flavoured preloads, containing either 17 g whey protein plus 5 g guar (n = 37) or flavoured placebo (n = 42), 15 minutes before two meals, each day for 12 weeks. Blood glucose and gastric emptying (breath test) were measured before and after a mashed potato meal at baseline (without preload), and after the preload at the beginning (week 1) and end (week 12) of treatment. HbA1c levels, energy intake, weight and body composition were also evaluated.

   RESULTS: Gastric emptying was slower (P < 0.01) and postprandial blood glucose levels lower (P < 0.05) with the whey/guar preload compared to placebo preload, and the magnitude of reduction in glycaemia was related to the rate of gastric emptying at both week 1 (r = -0.54, P < 0.001) and week 12 (r = -0.54, P < 0.0001). At the end of treatment, there was a 1 mmol/mol [0.1%] reduction in HbA1c in the whey/guar group compared to the placebo group (49 +/- 1.0 mmol/mol [6.6 +/- 0.05%] vs. 50 +/- 0.8 mmol/mol [6.7 +/- 0.05%]; P < 0.05). There were no differences in energy intake, body weight, or lean or fat mass between the groups.

   CONCLUSIONS: In patients with well-controlled T2DM, 12 weeks' treatment with a low-dose whey/guar preload, taken twice daily before meals, had sustained effects of slowing gastric emptying and reducing postprandial blood glucose, which were associated with a modest reduction in HbA1c, without causing weight gain.

Abstract
  AIMS: To compare the efficacy and safety of an intensification strategy of early triple combination therapy with dapagliflozin (DAPA) plus saxagliptin (SAXA) to a dual therapy strategy with sitagliptin (SITA) in patients with type 2 diabetes who are inadequately controlled with metformin (MET) monotherapy.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: This multinational, active-controlled, parallel-group phase 3b trial randomized 461 patients, at least 18 years of age, with glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) of 8%-10.5% (64-91 mmol/mol), to either DAPA plus SAXA or SITA, added to MET, for a 26-week double-blind treatment period and an extension of a 26-week blinded treatment period.

   RESULTS: Mean (+/- SD) baseline HbA1c was 8.8% +/- 0.9% (73.0 +/- 9.3 mmol/mol). DAPA plus SAXA (n = 232) provided a greater reduction from baseline in HbA1c at Weeks 26 and 52 compared with SITA (n = 229) (adjusted mean +/- SE change, Week 26: -1.41 +/- 0.07% vs -1.07 +/- 0.07% [-15.4 +/- 0.8 mmol/mol vs 11.7 +/- 0.8 mmol/mol]; P = 0.0008; Week 52: -1.29 +/- 0.08% vs -0.81 +/- 0.09% [14.1 +/- 0.9 mmol/mol vs 8.9 +/- 1.0 mmol/mol]). The between-group difference in adjusted mean (95% CI) change from baseline in HbA1c increased from -0.34 (-0.54, -0.14) at Week 26 to -0.48 (-0.71, -0.25) at Week 52. DAPA plus SAXA was generally well tolerated and the incidence of adverse events was similar in both treatment arms.

   CONCLUSIONS: Early intensification to triple therapy with DAPA plus SAXA results in better, more durable glycaemic control than addition of SITA only (dual therapy) in patients with high HbA1c levels who are uncontrolled with MET monotherapy.

Abstract
  AIMS: To compare the effects of continuing versus discontinuing sitagliptin when initiating and intensively titrating insulin glargine.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eligible patients had inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes on metformin (>=1500 mg/d) in combination with a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor and/or a sulphonylurea. Those on metformin + sitagliptin were directly randomized; all others were switched to metformin + sitagliptin (discontinuing other DPP-4 inhibitors and sulphonylureas) and stabilized during a run-in period. At randomization, patients were allocated to continuing sitagliptin or discontinuing sitagliptin, with both groups initiating insulin glargine and titrating to a target fasting glucose of 4.0 to 5.6 mmol/L.

   RESULTS: A total of 743 participants (mean glycated haemoglobin [HbA1c] 72.6 mmol/mol [8.8%], disease duration 10.8 years), were treated. After 30 weeks, the mean HbA1c and least squares (LS) mean change from baseline in HbA1c were 51.4 mmol/mol (6.85%) and -20.5 mmol/mol (-1.88%) in the sitagliptin group and 56.4 mmol/mol (7.31%) and -15.5 mmol/mol (-1.42%) in the placebo group; the difference in LS mean changes from baseline HbA1c was -5.0 mmol/mol (-0.46%; P < 0.001). The percentage of participants with HbA1c <53 mmol/mol (<7.0%) was higher (54% vs. 35%) and the mean daily insulin dose was lower (53 vs. 61 units) in the sitagliptin group. Despite lower HbA1c, event rates and incidences of hypoglycaemia were not higher in the sitagliptin group. Adverse events overall and changes from baseline in body weight were similar between the two treatment groups.

   CONCLUSION: When initiating insulin glargine therapy, continuation of sitagliptin, compared with discontinuation, resulted in a clinically meaningful greater reduction in HbA1c without an increase in hypoglycaemia.

Abstract
  Diabetes mellitus among older men has been associated with increased bone mineral density but paradoxically increased fracture risk. Given the interactions among medication treatment, glycemic control, and diabetes-associated comorbidities, the relative effects of each factor remains unclear. This retrospective study includes 652,901 male veterans aged >=65 years with diabetes and baseline hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) value. All subjects received primary care in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) from 2000 to 2010. Administrative data included ICD9 diagnoses and pharmacy records and was linked to Medicare fee-for-service data. Hazard ratios (HR) for any clinical fracture and hip fracture were calculated using competing risk hazards models, adjusted for fracture risk factors including age, race/ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), alcohol and tobacco use, rheumatoid arthritis, corticosteroid use, as well as diabetes-related comorbidities including cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and peripheral neuropathy. HbA1c <6.5% was associated with a higher risk of any clinical fracture (HR = 1.08, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06-1.11) compared with the reference HbA1c of 7.5% to 8.5%. Fracture risk was not increased among those with A1c >=8.5%, nor among those with A1c 6.5% to 7.5%. Use of insulin was independently associated with greater risk of fracture (HR = 1.10, 95% CI 1.07-1.12). There was a significant interaction between insulin use and HbA1c level, (p < 0.001), such that those using insulin with HbA1c <6.5% had HR = 1.23 and those with HbA1c 6.5% to 7.5% had HR = 1.15. Metformin use was associated with decreased fracture risk (HR = 0.88, 95% CI 0.87-0.90). We conclude that among older men with diabetes, those with HbA1c lower than 6.5% are at increased risk for any clinical and hip fracture. Insulin use is associated with higher fracture risk, especially among those with tight glycemic control. Our findings demonstrate the importance of the treatment regimen and avoiding hypoglycemia for fracture prevention in older men with diabetes. © 2019 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

Abstract
  AIMS: To describe the baseline clinical and laboratory findings and treatment modalities of 367 children and adolescents diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes in various paediatric endocrinology centres in Turkey.

   METHODS: A standard questionnaire regarding clinical and laboratory characteristics at onset was uploaded to an online national database system. Data for 367 children (aged 6-18 years) newly diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes at 37 different paediatric endocrinology centres were analysed.

   RESULTS: After exclusion of the children with a BMI Z-score < 1 SD, those with genetic syndromes associated with Type 2 diabetes, and those whose C-peptide and/or insulin levels were not available, 227 cases were included in the study. Mean age was 13.8 +/- 2.2 (range 6.5-17.8) years, with female preponderance (68%). Family history of Type 2 diabetes was positive in 86% of the children. The mean BMI was 31.3 +/- 6.5 kg/m2 (range 18.7-61) and BMI Z-score was 2.4 +/- 0.8 (range 1-5). More than half (57%) of the children were identified by an opportunistic diabetes screening due to existing risk markers without typical symptoms of diabetes. Only 13% (n = 29) were treated solely by lifestyle modification, while 40.5% (n = 92) were treated with metformin, 13% (n = 30) were treated with insulin, and 33.5% (n = 76) were treated with a combination of insulin and metformin initially. Mean HbA1C levels of the insulin and combination of insulin and metformin groups were 98 (11.1%) and 102 mmol/mol (11.5%), respectively, and also were significantly higher than the lifestyle modification only and metformin groups mean HbA1C levels (70(8.6%) and 67 mmol/mol (8.3%), respectively).

   CONCLUSIONS: An opportunistic screening of children who are at high risk of Type 2 diabetes is essential, as our data showed that > 50% of the children were asymptomatic at diagnosis. The other important result of our study was the high rate of exclusion from the initial registration (38%), suggesting that accurate diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes in youth is still problematic, even for paediatric endocrinologists.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Although a variety of antidiabetic drugs have significant protective action on the cardiovascular system, it is still unclear which antidiabetic drugs can improve ventricular remodeling and fundamentally delay the process of heart failure. The purpose of this network meta-analysis is to compare the efficacy of sodium glucose cotransporter type 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists, metformin (MET), sulfonylurea (SU) and thiazolidinediones (TZDs) in improving left ventricular (LV) remodeling in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and/or cardiovascular disease (CVD).

   METHODS: We searched articles published before October 18, 2019, regardless of language or data, in 4 electronic databases: PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and Web of Science. We included randomized controlled trials in this network meta-analysis, as well as a small number of cohort studies. The differences in the mean changes in left ventricular echocardiographic parameters between the treatment group and control group were evaluated.

   RESULTS: The difference in the mean change in LV ejection fraction (LVEF) between GLP-1 agonists and placebo in treatment effect was greater than zero (MD = 2.04% [0.64%, 3.43%]); similar results were observed for the difference in the mean change in LV end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD) between SGLT-2 inhibitors and placebo (MD = - 3.3 mm [5.31, - 5.29]), the difference in the mean change in LV end-systolic volume (LVESV) between GLP-1 agonists and placebo (MD = - 4.39 ml [- 8.09, - 0.7]); the difference in the mean change in E/e' between GLP-1 agonists and placebo (MD = - 1.05[- 1.78, - 0.32]); and the difference in the mean change in E/e' between SGLT-2 inhibitors and placebo (MD = - 1.91[- 3.39, - 0.43]).

   CONCLUSIONS: GLP-1 agonists are more significantly associated with improved LVEF, LVESV and E/e', SGLT-2 inhibitors are more significantly associated with improved LVEDD and E/e', and DPP-4 inhibitors are more strongly associated with a negative impact on LV end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) than are placebos. SGLT-2 inhibitors are superior to other drugs in pairwise comparisons.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Few prospective studies have compared the cardiovascular benefits of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors. We aimed to clarify the efficacy of dapagliflozin versus sitagliptin for modulating cardiometabolic risk factors including high glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, hypoglycemia, and body weight.

   METHODS: This prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded-endpoint, parallel-group trial enrolled 340 Japanese patients with early-stage type 2 diabetes receiving metformin alone or no glucose-lowering agents, who were randomized to receive dapagliflozin or sitagliptin for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved the composite endpoint of HbA1c level maintenance < 7.0% (53 mmol/mol), avoidance of hypoglycemia (maintenance of sensor glucose >= 3.0 mmol/L or >= 54 mg/dL), and >= 3.0% body weight loss from baseline. Secondary endpoints included components of the primary endpoint, other metabolic indices, and glucose variability indices measured using flash glucose monitoring.

   RESULTS: Clinical characteristics of patients were age, 58.1 +/- 12.2 years; known duration of diabetes, 5.8 +/- 6.1 years; body weight, 74.7 +/- 14.2 kg; body mass index, 27.9 +/- 4.1 kg/m2; and HbA1c level, 7.8 +/- 0.8% at baseline. The achievement ratio of primary endpoint was significantly higher in the dapagliflozin group than in the sitagliptin group (24.4% vs. 13.8%, P < 0.05). While the rates of HbA1c level maintenance < 7.0% (53 mmol/mol) and avoidance of hypoglycemia were comparable between the groups (49.4 vs. 50.0% and 88.7 vs. 92.3% for dapagliflozin vs. sitagliptin, respectively), body weight loss of >= 3.0% was significantly achieved in the dapagliflozin group (54.4 vs. 19.6%, P < 0.001). Moreover, dapagliflozin was superior to sitagliptin regarding several secondary endpoints that modulate cardiometabolic risk, namely reducing fasting plasma glucose, insulin, uric acid, increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and suppressing the increase in serum creatinine and the decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate. On the other hand, sitagliptin was superior to dapagliflozin in suppressing glucose variability.

   CONCLUSIONS: Compared to sitagliptin, dapagliflozin was significantly more effective at improving cardiometabolic risk factors, suggesting that SGLT2 inhibitors might be more suitable than DPP-4 inhibitors for preventing cardiovascular events in patients with early-stage but inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: The use of metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus has been associated with lactic acidosis. However, the information available in patients with moderate-severe chronic kidney disease is scarce.

   METHODS: The ALIMAR-C2 study is a case-control study to assess the association between metformin and lactic acidosis in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and moderate-severe chronic kidney disease. The study will be performed with computerized registered electronic health records from eight Spanish hospitals linked to their corresponding primary care health areas from 2010 to 2016, comprising approximately 22.1 million person-years of follow-up. Logistic regression will be used to assess the crude and adjusted risk of lactic acidosis associated with metformin use overall and stratifying by use and dose categories, and chronic kidney disease stage. The overall case fatality rate of lactic acidosis, as well as the case fatality rate stratified by chronic kidney disease stage, will be calculated.

   DISCUSSION: The ALIMAR-C2 study will provide useful information about the risk of lactic acidosis in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with renal impairment using metformin.

Abstract
  AIMS: Lowering postprandial lipemia may mitigate cardiovascular risk in patients with diabetic dyslipidemia. This study was aimed to investigate whether saroglitazar suppresses postprandial lipemia in patients with diabetes and dyslipidemia.

   METHODS: This was a 12-week, prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study of saroglitazar in patients with diabetes and dyslipidemia. Thirty patients were randomized (1:1) to receive saroglitazar 4 mg or placebo orally once daily with metformin for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was change in plasma triglyceride (TG) area under the curve (AUC) on a standardized 8-h fat tolerance test.

   RESULTS: Thirty participants were randomized for interventions and eventually data of 19 participants qualified for per protocol analyses. Mean (SD) age in saroglitazar was 53.1 (8.8) years and 54.9 (7.7) years in placebo group. After 12 weeks, saroglitazar significantly lowered postprandial TG-AUC by - 458.3 (144.0) (- 25.7%, 95% CI - 765.1 to - 151.4) versus an increase of + 10.9 (157.9) (+ 0.5%, 95% CI - 325.6 to 347.3) mg/dL h in placebo group (P < 0.05). Saroglitazar lowered postprandial TG incremental AUC versus placebo: - 329.4 (89.9) (- 59%) versus + 80.4 (99.4) (+ 10%) mg/dL h (P < 0.05). HbA1c (%) decreased by - 0.36 (0.42) in the saroglitazar group as compared to an increase of + 1.26 (0.46) (P < 0.05) with placebo.

   CONCLUSIONS: The saroglitazar treatment significantly improved postprandial TGs in people with diabetic dyslipidemia.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: The aim of this case-control study was to assess the efficacy of dapagliflozin combined with metformin for type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS).

   METHODS: A total of 36 patients with newly-diagnosed T2DM and OSAHS were randomized divided into two groups. Eighteen OSAHS patients with T2DM, who were treated with dapagliflozin and metformin, were assigned as the dapagliflozin group. These patients were given dapagliflozin and metformin for 24 weeks between February 2017 and February 2018. Another 18 OSAHS patients with T2DM, who were treated with glimepiride and metformin for 24 weeks, were assigned as the control group. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level, postprandial blood glucose (PPG), hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c), fasting insulin, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), blood lipids, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), minimum oxygen saturation (LSpO2), and Epworth Somnolence Scale (ESS) score were measured before and at 24 weeks after the initiation of treatment.

   RESULTS: In the dapagliflozin group, triglyceride (TG), systolic pressure (SBP) and diastolic pressure (DBP) significantly decreased following treatment, while high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) significantly increased (P < 0.05). Furthermore, a reduction in AHI, an increase in LSpO2 and a decrease in ESS score were observed in the dapagliflozin group (P < 0.05), but not in the control group. Moreover, blood glucose, HbA1c, HOMA-IR, and BMI significantly decreased in these two groups, and the decrease was more significant in the dapagliflozin group.

   CONCLUSION: These present results indicate that dapagliflozin can significantly reduce glucose, BMI, blood pressure and AHI, and improve hypoxemia during sleep and excessive daytime sleepiness, which thereby has potential as an effective treatment approach for OSAHS.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To understand the factors associated with glycemic control after starting insulin in youth with type 2 diabetes following glycemic failure (persistent HbA1c >=8%) with metformin alone, metformin + rosiglitazone or metformin + lifestyle in the TODAY study.

   METHODS: Change in HbA1c after add-on insulin therapy and the factors predictive of glycemic response were evaluated. At 1-year postinsulin initiation, 253 youth had a mean of 3.9 +/- 1.0 visits since the time of insulin initiation. Participants were divided into three groups according to glycemic control: consistent decrease in HbA1c by >=0.5%, change <0.5%, or consistent increase in HbA1c >=0.5%, at 75% or more of the visits.

   RESULTS: Within 1-year postinsulin initiation, 33.2% of participants had a consistent HbA1c decrease of >=0.5%, 46.2% changed HbA1c <0.5%, and 20.6% had an increase >=0.5%. At randomization into TODAY and at time of insulin initiation, the three glycemia groups were similar in age, sex, race-ethnicity, pubertal stage, BMI z-score, diabetes duration, and insulin secretion indices. Consistent HbA1c improvement was associated with higher insulin sensitivity (1/fasting insulin) at randomization and at time of failure, higher adiponectin at randomization, and was not associated with indices of beta-cell function.

   CONCLUSIONS: Response to add-on insulin was highly variable among youth in TODAY. Greater insulin sensitivity and higher adiponectin concentrations at randomization were associated with improved glycemic control after initiation of insulin. Due to limited information on adherence to insulin injections, the roles of adherence to the prescribed insulin regimen or psychosocial factors are unknown. Copyright © 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Type II diabetes and certain diabetes treatments have been observed to impact breast cancer risk. However, their associations with different breast cancer molecular subtype defined by estrogen receptor (ER)/progesterone receptor (PR)/HER2 status are unclear.

   METHODS: We conducted a retrospective multi-center population-based case-case study consisting of 4,557 breast cancer cases to evaluate the impact of type II diabetes and diabetes medications on the risk of different breast cancer molecular subtypes [ER+/HER2-, ER+/HER2+, triple negative (ER-/PR-/HER2-), and HER2 overexpressing (H2E, ER-/PR-/HER2+)]. Using ER+/HER2- cases as the reference group, we estimated ORs and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) for each subtype using polytomous logistic regression.

   RESULTS: Compared with those without a diabetes history, women with type II diabetes had a 38% (95% CI, 1.01-1.89) increased odds of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Current and longer term recent metformin use (13-24 months of treatment within the 24-month period prior to breast cancer diagnosis) was associated with elevated odds of TNBC (OR = 1.54; 95% CI, 1.07-2.22 and OR = 1.80; 95% CI, 1.13-2.85, respectively).

   CONCLUSIONS: The odds of having a triple-negative rather than ER+/HER2- breast cancer is greater for women with type II diabetes, and particularly for those who were users of metformin. This finding is supported by some preclinical data suggesting that diabetes may be more strongly associated with risk of triple-negative disease.

   IMPACT: Our study provides novel evidence regarding potential differential effects of type II diabetes and metformin use on risk of different molecular subtypes of breast cancer. Copyright ©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes is a kind of metabolic disease. Its clinical characteristic is hyperglycemia. Recently, more and more elderly people suffer from type 2 diabetes, and the glycemic variability of the elderly is greater. In addition, blood sugar variation is more likely to cause diabetes complications than simple hyperglycemia. Sancai podwer (SC) is based on the theory of traditional Chinese medicine and gradually formed in the summary of clinical experience. It has the effect of lowering blood sugar and alleviating clinical symptoms of diabetes. But the existing evidence of its efficacy on glycemic variability is insufficient. So, in our study, the randomized controlled trials will be used as a research method to explore the effects of SC on glycemic variability of type 2 diabetes.

   METHOD: We will use randomized controlled experiments based on the recommended diagnostic criteria, inclusion and exclusion criteria. A total of 60 elderly patients with type 2 diabetes will be randomly divided into treatment group and control group, 30 cases in each group. The control group will receive conventional western medicine and the intervention group will receive SC combined with western medicine. The standard deviation and coefficient of variation of blood glucose level will be used as evaluation indexes.

   DISCUSSION: This study can provide evidence for the clinical efficacy and safety of SC in elderly patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

   TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study is registered on the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry: ChiCTR2000032611.

Abstract
  AIMS: Metformin is first-line treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus and reduces cardiovascular events in patients with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Target tissue for metformin action is thought to be the liver, where metformin distribution depends on facilitated transport by polyspecific transmembrane organic cation transporters (OCTs). Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common liver disease in the western world with strong associations to insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome, but whether NAFLD affects metformin biodistribution to the liver is not known. In this study, the primary aim was to investigate in vivo hepatic uptake of metformin dynamically in humans with variable degrees of liver affection. As a secondary aim, we wished to correlate hepatic metformin distribution with OCT gene transcription determined in diagnostic liver biopsies.

   METHODS: Eighteen patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD were investigated using 11C-metformin PET/CT technique. Gene transcripts of OCTs were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

   RESULTS: We observed similar hepatic volume of distribution of metformin between patients with simple steatosis and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) (Vd 2.38 +/- 0.56 vs. 2.10 +/- 0.39, P = 0.3). There was no association between hepatic exposure to metformin and the degree of inflammation or fibrosis, and no clear correlation between metformin distribution and OCT gene transcription.

   CONCLUSION: Metformin is distributed to the liver in patients with NAFLD and the distribution is not impaired by inflammation or fibrosis. The findings imply that metformin action in liver in patients with NAFLD may be preserved. Copyright © 2019 The British Pharmacological Society.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: This study aim at evaluating the efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin plus saxagliptin vs monotherapy as added to metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

   METHOD: PubMed, Cochrane library, Embase, CNKI and Wanfang databases were searched up to 31 December 2019. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) applicable in dapagliflozin plus saxagliptin vs monotherapy as added to metformin in the treatment of T2DM were included. The outcomes included changes in HbA1c, FPG, body weight, SBP, DBP and adverse reactions. Fixed or random effects model were used to assess these outcomes.

   RESULTS: In this study, 8 RCTs involved 7346 patients were included. Compared with dapagliflozin plus metformin(DM) group, patients treated with dapagliflozin plus saxagliptin add on to metformin(DSM) could significantly increase the adjusted mean change levels of HbA1c, FPG, SBP and DBP(P < .00001, SMD = -4.88, 95%CI = -6.93~-2.83; P < .00001, SMD = -6.50, 95%CI = -8.55~-4.45; P < .00001, SMD = -0.97, 95%CI = -1.15~-0.78; P < .00001, SMD = -2.00, 95%CI = -2.20~-1.80), but no major difference in body weight loss showed(P = .12, SMD = 0.92, 95%CI = -0.22~2.06). Furthermore, DSM therapy displayed better effects than saxagliptin plus metformin(SM) in the adjusted mean change levels of HbA1c, FPG, body weight and SBP(P < .00001, SMD = -7.75, 95%CI = -8.84~-6.66; P < .00001, SMD = -7.75, 95%CI = -8.84~-6.66; P = .04, SMD = -3.40, 95%CI = -6.64~-0.17; P = .04, SMD = -7.75, 95%CI = -8.84~-6.66), whereas no obvious difference in lowering DBP(P = .18, SMD = -16.35, 95%CI = -40.12~7.41). Additionally, compared with DM and SM groups, there were no remarkable difference in the incidence of nausea, influenza, headache, diarrhea, urinary tract infection and renal failure for patients taking DSM, but the incidence of genital infection and hypoglycemia were higher in DSM group.

   CONCLUSIONS: Patients taking the DSM therapy had better effects in reducing the level of HbA1c, FPG, body weight, SBP and DBP than the DM and SM therapy. However, patients treated with DSM therapy are more likely to have hypoglycemia and genital infection. Dapagliflozin plus saxagliptin may be a suitable therapy strategy for patients with T2DM inadequately controlled with metformin, and this will provide a clinical reference for the treatment of T2DM.

Abstract
  PURPOSE: To determine the separated and combined effects of metformin and exercise on insulin sensitivity and free-living glycemic control in overweight individuals with prediabetes/type 2 diabetes (T2DM).

   METHODS: We recruited 16 adults with BMI of 32.7 +/- 4.3 kg m-2 and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR 3.2 +/- 0.4) under chronic metformin treatment (1234 +/- 465 g day-1) enrolled in a high-intensity interval training (HIIT) program. Participants underwent four 72-h experimental trials in a random-counterbalanced order: (1) maintaining their habitual metformin treatment (MET); (2) replacing metformin treatment by placebo (CON); (3) placebo plus two HIIT sessions (EX + CON), and (4) metformin plus two HIIT sessions (MET + EX). We used intermittently scanned continuous glucose monitoring (isCGM) during 72 h in every trial to obtain interstitial fluid glucose area under the curve (IFGAUC) and the percentage of measurements over 180 mg dL-1 (% IFGPEAKS). Insulin sensitivity was assessed on the last day of each trial with HOMA-IR index and calculated insulin sensitivity (CSI) from intravenous glucose tolerance test.

   RESULTS: IFGAUC was lower in MET + EX and MET than in CON (P = 0.011 and P = 0.025, respectively). In addition, IFGAUC was lower in MET + EX than in EX + CON (P = 0.044). %IFGPEAKS were only lower in MET + EX in relation to CON (P = 0.028). HOMA-IR and CSI were higher in CON in comparison with MET + EX (P = 0.011 and P = 0.022, respectively) and MET (P = 0.006 and P < 0.001, respectively). IFGAUC showed a significant correlation with HOMA-IR.

   CONCLUSION: Intense aerobic exercise in patients with diabetes and prediabetes under metformin treatment reduces free-living 72-h blood hyperglycemic peaks. This may help to prevent the development of cardiovascular complications associated with diabetes.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: A large number of patients with diabetic kidney disease (DKD) approach traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) owing to discontent with standard treatments. Based on TCM theory and clinical experience, the syndrome of kidney yin deficiency is a common type of DKD. Liuwei Dihuang pills (LDPs) is a common prescription of a Chinese herbal formula for patients presenting this syndrome of DKD. However, well-established data supporting the efficacy and safety of LDP in DKD treatment are lacking.

   METHODS: We have designed a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial. After a 2-week run-in period, 124 eligible participants with DKD will be assigned to either the experimental or the control group in a 1:1 ratio. Patients in the experimental group will receive LDP, while patients in the control group will receive a matched placebo. As the basic treatment in the 2 groups, metformin hydrochloride sustained-release tablets, for blood glucose control, and irbesartan tablets, for blood pressure regulation, will be provided. All participants will undergo 4 weeks of treatment and 12 weeks of follow-up. The primary outcome is the change in 24 hours urinary protein levels, measured from the baseline to the end of the treatment phase (week 24). The secondary outcomes to be assessed include the change in serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate, urinary albumin excretion rate, improvement of TCM syndromes and symptoms, fasting blood glucose and postprandial 2-hour blood glucose, blood lipids (total cholesterol, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, from baseline to weeks 12 and 24.

   DISCUSSION: The results of this study will provide high-quality evidence of the effects of LDP in DKD treatment, which will provide an alternative treatment strategy in patients with DKD.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Frailty is a geriatric syndrome that leads to poor health outcomes with aging. Previous studies have demonstrated that insulin resistance and inflammation predict frailty onset. Metformin is a widely used, well-tolerated drug that improves insulin sensitivity and displays anti-inflammatory properties. It is also known to prevent diabetes onset in adults with prediabetes. We hypothesize that metformin in older adults with prediabetes will promote healthy aging and prevent frailty. Here we describe an ongoing placebo-controlled, double-blinded clinical trial of metformin for the prevention of frailty in older adults with prediabetes.

   METHODS: Older adults aged more than 65 years are randomized to metformin or placebo and are followed for 2 years. Prediabetes, required for inclusion, is assessed by 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test. Exclusion criteria are baseline frailty (Fried criteria), diabetes, dementia, untreated depression, active malignancy, or severe cardiovascular, pulmonary, and neurologic diseases. Primary outcome is frailty; secondary outcomes are physical function (Short Physical Performance Battery), systemic and skeletal muscle tissue inflammation, muscle insulin signaling, insulin sensitivity (insulin clamp), glucose tolerance (oral glucose tolerance test), and body composition (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry). Subjects are followed every 3 months for safety assessments and every 6 months for frailty assessment (Fried criteria) and oral glucose tolerance test, and every 12 or 24 months for secondary outcomes. Enrollment of 120 subjects (completers) will take place over a 2-year period.

   CONCLUSION: Metformin is being examined in this study as a potential therapeutic agent to prevent frailty in older adults with prediabetes. Findings from this trial may have future implications for the screening and potential treatment of prediabetes in older patients with metformin for the prevention of frailty.

Abstract
  Diabetes mellitus is associated with increased levels of inflammation and oxidative stress in patients. The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that aqueous extract of Cichorium intybus seeds (AECIS) would have add-on beneficial effect in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In this double-blind randomized clinical study, 150 subjects were enrolled to assess the add-on efficacy and safety of AECIS in T2DM patients. The subjects were randomized (1:1) to the AECIS (n = 51) and placebo (n = 49) groups. The subjects in both groups continued to take prescribed doses of metformin. The standardization of AECIS was carried out by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and phytochemical analysis. The mean hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level in the AECIS and placebo groups at baseline was 8.6% and 8.5%, respectively. Mean values of HbA1c at the end of 12 weeks of intervention were 7.42% in the AECIS group (a reduction of 1.18% from baseline) and 8.4% in the placebo group (mean reduction of 0.1% from baseline). Besides, significant reduction in inflammation, oxidative stress, and hypertriglyceridemia was seen in the AECIS group (p < .05). The study shows for the first time that AECIS supplementation ameliorates the disease progression and it is beneficial as a potential adjunct dietary supplement for the management of T2DM.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: Preclinical research suggests a role of Glucagon Like Peptide-1 Receptors (GLP-1R) on the regulation of human bronchial tone. We investigated the effect of GLP-1R agonists on lung function of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) population without co-existing chronic obstructive respiratory disorders.

   METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study that examined change in lung function measurements over two years of T2DM patients (n=32) treated with metformin monotherapy (control cohort), metformin plus GLP-1R agonists (GLP-1R agonists cohort), or metformin plus insulin (insulin cohort).

   RESULTS: After 24 months of treatment, the forced expiratory volume in 1s (FEV1) significantly (p<0.05) increased from baseline in the GLP-1R agonists cohort (218ml [95%CI 88-246]), but not in the control and insulin cohorts (94ml [95%CI -28 - 216] and 26ml [95%CI -174 - 226], respectively; p>0.05 vs. baseline). The average increase in FEV1 in the GLP-1R agonists cohort was significantly greater than that in the control and insulin cohorts (delta: 110ml [95%CI 18-202] and 177ml [95%CI 85-270], respectively, p<0.05). The forced vital capacity (FVC) also increased significantly more in the GLP-1R agonists cohort than in the control and insulin cohorts (overall delta FVC: 183ml [95%CI 72-295], p<0.05). The maximal expiratory flow at 50-75% significantly (p<0.05) improved from baseline in the GLP-1R agonists cohort, but not in the control and insulin cohorts (p>0.05).

   CONCLUSION: Our preliminary results suggest a potential new therapeutic perspective to treat airway disorders with GLP-1R agonists. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVES: Fixed-dose combination (FDC) therapy can improve outcomes in type 2 diabetes (T2D). We evaluated the bioequivalence of 2 doses of an FDC of extended-release metformin (metformin XR), empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor, and linagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, versus corresponding free tablet combinations.

   METHODS: Two randomized, open-label, two-way crossover studies in healthy adults compared: 2 FDC tablets of empagliflozin 5 mg/linagliptin 2.5 mg/metformin XR 1000 mg (Study 1; N = 30), 1 FDC tablet of empagliflozin 25 mg/linagliptin 5 mg/metformin XR 1000 mg (Study 2; N = 30) versus corresponding dose of free combinations. Subjects received study medication under fed conditions; washout was >=35 days between treatments. Primary endpoints: area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from time 0 to last quantifiable data point for empagliflozin and metformin; AUC from time 0 to 72 hours for linagliptin, and peak plasma concentration (Cmax) for empagliflozin, linagliptin, and metformin. Bioequivalence was defined as adjusted geometric mean ratios (FDC: free combination) and two-sided 90% confidence intervals (CIs) of AUC and Cmax for each component within 80.00-125.00%.

   RESULTS: Study 1: 27/29 and 28/30 treated participants were included in the pharmacokinetic analysis for the FDC and free combination periods, respectively. Study 2: 29/29 treated participants were included in the pharmacokinetic analysis for both periods. The adjusted geometric mean ratios of FDCs to their respective free tablet combinations and two-sided 90% CIs were all within the predefined range. The shapes of the mean plasma concentration-time profile of empagliflozin, linagliptin, and metformin XR were similar for subjects in the FDC and free combination groups in both studies. No serious adverse events were reported.

   CONCLUSION: The evaluated doses of empagliflozin/linagliptin/metformin XR FDC tablets were bioequivalent to the corresponding free combinations. Based on these two bioequivalence studies and existing phase 3 data, the FDA has recently approved this triple FDC to improve glycemic control in adults with T2D.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Atherosclerosis in obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is associated with low-grade inflammation (LGI) and dyslipidemia, where especially small, dense lipoprotein particles are atherogenic. The glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, liraglutide, reduces cardiovascular events by poorly understood mechanisms. We investigated the effect of liraglutide combined with metformin on LGI and lipoprotein density profiles in patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) and newly diagnosed T2DM.

   METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial over a 12 + 12-week period, with >=2-week wash-out.

   INTERVENTION: liraglutide/metformin vs. placebo/metformin. Lipoproteins were separated by continuous density gradient ultracentrifugation, and LDL divided into five subfractions between 226 and 270A, considering particle size <=255A as the atherogenic pattern. Plasma C-reactive protein and tumor necrosis factor-alpha were assessed by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent-assay.

   RESULTS: 28 out of 41 randomized patients completed all visits. Intention-to-treat analysis was performed but one patient had statin dosage and was excluded from the analysis. 95% of the patients were on statin therapy. Overall, liraglutide did not affect lipid subfractions or markers of LGI compared to placebo. The combination of liraglutide and metformin reduced the total LDL subfractions, primarily by reducing the most atherogenic subfraction LDL5, and reduced CRP but not TNF-alpha. Explorative analyses suggested that the subfraction LDL5 during the wash-out period rebounded significantly at least in a per-protocol analysis of the sub-group of patients starting the liraglutide therapy.

   CONCLUSIONS: In patients with CAD and newly diagnosed T2DM on stable statin therapy, liraglutide combined with metformin may improve the atherogenic LDL lipid profile and CRP. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: For those with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), impact of short-term high-dose glucocorticoid exposure on beta-cell function is unknown. This study aims to compare the impact on beta-cell function and insulin resistance of prednisone 40 mg between adults with newly diagnosed T2DM and healthy adults.

   METHODS: Five adults with T2DM and five healthy adults, all between 18-50 years, were enrolled. T2DM diagnosis was less than one year prior, HbA1c<75 mmol/mol (9.0%), with metformin treatment only. Pre- and post-therapy testing included 75-g oral glucose tolerance, plasma glucose, C-peptide, and insulin. Intervention therapy was prednisone 40mg daily for 3 days.

   RESULTS: Upon therapy completion, HOMA-IR did not increase or differ between groups. Percentile difference for HOMA-%B and insulinogenic index in those with T2DM was significantly lower statistically (50.4% and 69.2% respectively) compared to healthy subjects (19% and 32.2%).

   CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to the assumption that insulin resistance is the main driver of glucocorticoid-induced hyperglycemia, results indicate that decreased beta-cell insulin secretion is the more likely cause in those with T2DM. This is evidenced by significant drops in C-peptide AUC and HOMA-%B and increased glucose AUC in T2DM group only. These results may be caused by increased beta-cell fragility along with reduced recovery ability after glucocorticoid exposure. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03661684.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of oral semaglutide added to insulin with or without metformin.

   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients with type 2 diabetes uncontrolled on insulin with or without metformin were randomized to oral semaglutide 3 mg (N = 184), 7 mg (N = 182), or 14 mg (N = 181) or to placebo (N = 184) in a 52-week, double-blind trial. End points were change from baseline to week 26 in HbA1c (primary) and body weight (confirmatory secondary). Two estimands were defined: treatment policy (effect regardless of trial product discontinuation or rescue medication) and trial product (effect assuming trial product continuation without rescue medication) in randomized patients.

   RESULTS: Oral semaglutide was superior to placebo in reducing HbA1c (estimated treatment difference [ETD] -0.5% [95% CI -0.7, -0.3], -0.9% [-1.1, -0.7], and -1.2% [-1.4, -1.0] for 3, 7, and 14 mg, respectively; P < 0.001) and body weight (ETD -0.9 kg [95% CI -1.8, -0.0], -2.0 kg [-3.0, -1.0], and -3.3 kg [-4.2, -2.3]; P = 0.0392 for 3 mg, P <= 0.0001 for 7 and 14 mg) at week 26 (treatment policy estimand). Significantly greater dose-dependent HbA1c and body weight reductions versus placebo were achieved with oral semaglutide at weeks 26 and 52 (both estimands). The most frequent adverse event with oral semaglutide was nausea (11.4-23.2% of patients vs. 7.1% with placebo; mostly mild to moderate).

   CONCLUSIONS: Oral semaglutide was superior to placebo in reducing HbA1c and body weight when added to insulin with or without metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: Efficacy and safety of the glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) analog oral semaglutide and the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor empagliflozin were compared in patients with type 2 diabetes uncontrolled on metformin.

   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients were randomized to once-daily open-label treatment with oral semaglutide 14 mg (n = 412) or empagliflozin 25 mg (n = 410) in a 52-week trial. Key end points were change from baseline to week 26 in HbA1c (primary) and body weight (confirmatory secondary). Two estimands addressed efficacy-related questions: treatment policy (regardless of trial product discontinuation or rescue medication) and trial product (on trial product without rescue medication) in all randomized patients.

   RESULTS: Four hundred (97.1%) patients in the oral semaglutide group and 387 (94.4%) in the empagliflozin group completed the trial. Oral semaglutide provided superior reductions in HbA1c versus empagliflozin at week 26 (treatment policy -1.3% vs. -0.9% [-14 vs. -9 mmol/mol], estimated treatment difference [ETD] -0.4% [95% CI -0.6, -0.3] [-5 mmol/mol (-6, -3)]; P < 0.0001). The treatment difference in HbA1c significantly favored oral semaglutide at week 26 for the trial product estimand (-1.4% vs. -0.9% [-15 vs. -9 mmol/mol], ETD -0.5% [95% CI -0.7, -0.4] [-6 mmol/mol (-7, -5)]; P < 0.0001) and at week 52 for both estimands (P < 0.0001). Superior weight loss was not confirmed at week 26 (treatment policy), but oral semaglutide was significantly better than empagliflozin at week 52 (trial product -4.7 vs. -3.8 kg; P = 0.0114). Gastrointestinal adverse events were more common with oral semaglutide.

   CONCLUSIONS: Oral semaglutide was superior to empagliflozin in reducing HbA1c but not body weight at 26 weeks in patients with type 2 diabetes uncontrolled on metformin. At week 52, HbA1c and body weight (trial product estimand) were significantly reduced versus empagliflozin. Oral semaglutide was well tolerated within the established safety profile of GLP-1 receptor agonists. Copyright © 2019 by the American Diabetes Association.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Worldwide, there is an increasing incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Metformin is still the recommended first-line glucose-lowering drug for people with T2DM. Despite this, the effects of metformin on patient-important outcomes are still not clarified.

   OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of metformin monotherapy in adults with T2DM.

   SEARCH METHODS: We based our search on a systematic report from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and topped-up the search in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, WHO ICTRP, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Additionally, we searched the reference lists of included trials and systematic reviews, as well as health technology assessment reports and medical agencies. The date of the last search for all databases was 2 December 2019, except Embase (searched up 28 April 2017).

   SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with at least one year's duration comparing metformin monotherapy with no intervention, behaviour changing interventions or other glucose-lowering drugs in adults with T2DM.

   DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors read all abstracts and full-text articles/records, assessed risk of bias, and extracted outcome data independently. We resolved discrepancies by involvement of a third review author. For meta-analyses we used a random-effects model with investigation of risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes, using 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for effect estimates. We assessed the overall certainty of the evidence by using the GRADE instrument.

   MAIN RESULTS: We included 18 RCTs with multiple study arms (N = 10,680). The percentage of participants finishing the trials was approximately 58% in all groups. Treatment duration ranged from one to 10.7 years. We judged no trials to be at low risk of bias on all 'Risk of bias' domains. The main outcomes of interest were all-cause mortality, serious adverse events (SAEs), health-related quality of life (HRQoL), cardiovascular mortality (CVM), non-fatal myocardial infarction (NFMI), non-fatal stroke (NFS), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Two trials compared metformin (N = 370) with insulin (N = 454). Neither trial reported on all-cause mortality, SAE, CVM, NFMI, NFS or ESRD. One trial provided information on HRQoL but did not show a substantial difference between the interventions. Seven trials compared metformin with sulphonylureas. Four trials reported on all-cause mortality: in three trials no participant died, and in the remaining trial 31/1454 participants (2.1%) in the metformin group died compared with 31/1441 participants (2.2%) in the sulphonylurea group (very low-certainty evidence). Three trials reported on SAE: in two trials no SAE occurred (186 participants); in the other trial 331/1454 participants (22.8%) in the metformin group experienced a SAE compared with 308/1441 participants (21.4%) in the sulphonylurea group (very low-certainty evidence). Two trials reported on CVM: in one trial no CVM was observed and in the other trial 4/1441 participants (0.3%) in the metformin group died of cardiovascular reasons compared with 8/1447 participants (0.6%) in the sulphonylurea group (very low-certainty evidence). Three trials reported on NFMI: in two trials no NFMI occurred, and in the other trial 21/1454 participants (1.4%) in the metformin group experienced a NFMI compared with 15/1441 participants (1.0%) in the sulphonylurea group (very low-certainty evidence). One trial reported no NFS occurred (very low-certainty evidence). No trial reported on HRQoL or ESRD. Seven trials compared metformin with thiazolidinediones (very low-certainty evidence for all outcomes). Five trials reported on all-cause mortality: in two trials no participant died; the overall RR was 0.88, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.39; P = 0.57; 5 trials; 4402 participants). Four trials reported on SAE, the RR was 0,95, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.09; P = 0.49; 3208 participants. Four trials reported on CVM, the RR was 0.71, 95% CI 0.21 to 2.39; P = 0.58; 3211 participants. Three trial reported on NFMI: in two trials no NFMI occurred and in one trial 21/1454 participants (1.4%) in the metformin group experienced a NFMI compared with 25/1456 participants (1.7%) in the thiazolidinedione group. One trial reported no NFS occurred. No trial reported on HRQoL or ESRD. Three trials compared metformin with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (one trial each with saxagliptin, sitagliptin, vildagliptin with altogether 1977 participants). There was no substantial difference between the interventions for all-cause mortality, SAE, CVM, NFMI and NFS (very low-certainty evidence for all outcomes). One trial compared metformin with a glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue (very low-certainty evidence for all reported outcomes). There was no substantial difference between the interventions for all-cause mortality, CVM, NFMI and NFS. One or more SAEs were reported in 16/268 (6.0%) of the participants allocated to metformin compared with 35/539 (6.5%) of the participants allocated to a glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue. HRQoL or ESRD were not reported. One trial compared metformin with meglitinide and two trials compared metformin with no intervention. No deaths or SAEs occurred (very low-certainty evidence) no other patient-important outcomes were reported. No trial compared metformin with placebo or a behaviour changing interventions. Four ongoing trials with 5824 participants are likely to report one or more of our outcomes of interest and are estimated to be completed between 2018 and 2024. Furthermore, 24 trials with 2369 participants are awaiting assessment.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the association between metformin treatment and the risk of neurodegenerative disease (ND) among elderly adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

   DESIGN/SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective longitudinal cohort study examined the effects of the length of metformin exposure on ND among elderly US veterans with T2DM and insulin treatment using the Veterans Affairs electronic medical record database.

   PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary clinical outcome was defined as diagnosis of ND including dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD) and mild cognitive impairment during the follow-up period. The secondary clinical outcomes were separately measured by AD, PD, HD, dementia and mild cognitive impairment.

   RESULT: Adjusted by propensity score weight, a total of 5528 patients (mean age, 63.2+/-10.9 years; male, 98%; white, 60%) with a median follow-up of 5.2 years were selected. Those with ND or other mental disorders at baseline or who were on insulin for less than two-thirds of the study period were excluded. The incidence rate of ND was 11.48 per 1000 person-years among patients with metformin treatment, compared with 25.45 per 1000 person-years for those without metformin. Compared with no metformin use, 2-4 years and >4 years of metformin exposure were significantly associated with lower risk of ND (adjusted HR (aHR)=0.62, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.85; aHR=0.19, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.31, respectively), while metformin exposure in the first 2 years showed no significant influence.

   CONCLUSION: We conclude that long-term metformin therapy (>2 years) was associated with lower incidence of ND among elderly veterans with T2DM. We need to conduct a study with more representative population and more robust method for causal inferences. Further investigation into the mechanism involved is needed along with randomised trials to confirm a potential neuroprotective effect of metformin. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To determine the comparative efficacy of once-weekly semaglutide relative to sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is) licensed in Europe and North America among patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) inadequately controlled with 1-2 oral antidiabetics (OADs), using a network meta-analysis (NMA). Design systematic review and network meta-analysis. Data Sources EMBASE, MEDLINE and CENTRAL were searched from January 1994 to August 2017.

   METHODS: Randomised controlled trials with >=20 weeks of treatment evaluating once-weekly semaglutide or SGLT-2is. Primary outcomes included change from baseline in: HbA1c, weight, systolic blood pressure, postprandial blood glucose and fasting plasma glucose. Fixed-effect and random-effect Bayesian NMA were used to indirectly compare treatment effects at 26 (+/-4) weeks. Metaregression and sensitivity analyses were conducted. Model selection was performed using the deviance information criterion and consistency was assessed by comparing indirect (edge-splitting) to direct evidence.

   RESULTS: Forty-eight publications representing 21 trials were included. The mean differences (MD) in change from baseline in HbA1c of once-weekly semaglutide 1.0 mg versus SGLT-2is ranged from -0.56% for canagliflozin 300 mg (95% credible interval (CrI): -0.76 to -0.33%), to -0.95% for dapagliflozin 5 mg (95% CrI: -1.20 to -0.69%). The MD in change from baseline in weight of once-weekly semaglutide 1.0 mg versus SGLT-2is ranged from -1.35 kg for canagliflozin 300 mg to -2.48 kg for dapagliflozin 5 mg, while change from baseline in fasting plasma glucose ranged from -0.41 mmol/L for canagliflozin 300 mg to -1.37 mmol/L for dapagliflozin 5 mg. Once-weekly semaglutide was not statistically differentiable than all SGLT-2is in reducing systolic blood pressure. NMA was not feasible for postprandial blood glucose and safety outcomes.

   CONCLUSION: Once-weekly semaglutide demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful reductions in HbA1c and body weight in T2D patients inadequately controlled with 1-2 OADs compared to all SGLT-2is licensed in Europe and North America.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: With the rising prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D), there is a substantial interest in novel, glucose-lowering drugs that may complement existing treatment options. Imeglimin is an oral antidiabetic agent currently in clinical development.

   AREAS COVERED: This review is based on a literature search using PubMed and Embase including all published manuscripts and presentations concerning imeglimin. Supplementary information was retrieved from the manufacturer's official webpage. Preclinical and clinical data are summarized with a focus on mechanisms of action as well as clinical efficacy and safety in T2D.

   EXPERT OPINION: Imeglimin's mode of action seems to be improved mitochondrial function in pancreatic beta cells leading to improved insulin secretion and lowering of plasma glucose levels. In clinical trials of up to 24 weeks, imeglimin in doses of 1,000-1,500 mg twice daily conferred modest reductions in glycates hemoglobin A1c of 6-11 mmol/mol (0.5-1.0%) (placebo-adjusted) as a monotherapy and 7 mmol/mol (0.6%) as an add-on therapy to metformin or sitagliptin in patients with T2D. Reported adverse effects were mainly gastrointestinal discomfort. The position of imeglimin among other pharmacotherapies in the treatment of T2D will be determined based on future studies more clearly outlining the safety and long-term cardiovascular effects.

   ABBREVIATIONS: AUC: area under the curve; BID: twice daily; DPP-4: dipeptidyl peptidase 4; GLP-1R: glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor; HbA1c: glycated hemoglobin A1c; HFHSD: high-fat high-sucrose diet; OAD: oral antidiabetic; OD: once daily; OGTT: oral glucose tolerance test; PPAR-gamma: peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma; PTP: permeability transition pore; SGLT-2: sodium-glucose transport protein 2; STZ: streptozotocin; T2D: type 2 diabetes.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of early management of hyperglycaemia with antidiabetic drugs plus lifestyle intervention compared with lifestyle alone, on microvascular function in adults with pre-diabetes.

   METHODS: Trial design: International, multicenter, randomised, partially double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial.

   PARTICIPANTS: Males and females aged 45-74 years with IFG, IGT or IFG+IGT, recruited from primary care centres in Australia, Austria, Bulgaria, Greece, Kuwait, Poland, Serbia, Spain and Turkey.

   INTERVENTION: Participants were randomized to placebo; metformin 1.700 mg/day; linagliptin 5 mg/day or fixed-dose combination of linagliptin/metformin. All patients were enrolled in a lifestyle intervention program (diet and physical activity). Drug intervention will last 2 years. Primary Outcome: composite end-point of diabetic retinopathy estimated by the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study Score, urinary albumin to creatinine ratio, and skin conductance in feet estimated by the sudomotor index. Secondary outcomes in a subsample include insulin sensitivity, beta-cell function, biomarkers of inflammation and fatty liver disease, quality of life, cognitive function, depressive symptoms and endothelial function.

   RESULTS: One thousand three hundred ninety one individuals with hyperglycaemia were assessed for eligibility, 424 excluded after screening, 967 allocated to placebo, metformin, linagliptin or to fixed-dose combination of metformin + linagliptin. A total of 809 people (91.1%) accepted and initiated the assigned treatment. Study sample after randomization was well balanced among the four groups. No statistical differences for the main risk factors analysed were observed between those accepting or rejecting treatment initiation. At baseline prevalence of diabetic retinopathy was 4.2%, severe neuropathy 5.3% and nephropathy 5.7%.

   CONCLUSIONS: ePREDICE is the first -randomized clinical trial with the aim to assess effects of different interventions (lifestyle and pharmacological) on microvascular function in people with pre-diabetes. The trial will provide novel data on lifestyle modification combined with glucose lowering drugs for the prevention of early microvascular complications and diabetes.

Abstract
  AIM: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of triple therapy with low-dose dapagliflozin plus saxagliptin added to metformin in uncontrolled type 2 diabetes.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: This 24-week, double-blind trial (NCT02681094) randomized 883 patients (glycated haemoglobin [HbA1c] 7.5-10.0%) on metformin >=1500 mg/d to add-on dapagliflozin 5 mg/d plus saxagliptin 5 mg/d or to add-on of either monocomponent. The primary endpoint was change in HbA1c from baseline.

   RESULTS: Baseline mean +/- SD patient characteristics were: age 56.7 +/- 10.5 years; HbA1c 8.2 +/- 0.9%; and diabetes duration 7.6 +/- 6.1 years. Triple therapy significantly decreased HbA1c versus dual therapy (-1.03% vs. -0.63% [dapagliflozin] vs. -0.69% [saxagliptin]; P < .0001). More patients achieved HbA1c <7.0% with triple versus dual therapy (41.6% vs. 21.8% [dapagliflozin; P < .0001] vs. 29.8% [saxagliptin; P = .0018]). Triple therapy significantly decreased fasting plasma glucose (-1.5 mmol/L vs. -1.1 mmol/L [dapagliflozin; P = .0135] vs. -0.7 mmol/L [saxagliptin; P < .0001]) and body weight (-2.0 kg vs. -0.4 kg [saxagliptin; P < .0001]), and beta-hydroxybutyrate levels were lower than with dapagliflozin plus metformin (mean difference -0.51; P = .0009). Urinary tract/genital infections and hypoglycaemia occurred in <5.0% and 5.8% of patients, respectively, with triple therapy.

   CONCLUSIONS: Triple therapy with once-daily dapagliflozin 5 mg, saxagliptin 5 mg and metformin significantly improved glycaemic control versus dual therapy with either agent added to metformin in uncontrolled type 2 diabetes, and was generally well tolerated.

Abstract
  AIMS: Dulaglutide, a once weekly GLP-1 receptor agonist, is approved at two doses (1.5 and 0.75 mg) for treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Two higher doses of dulaglutide (3.0 and 4.5 mg) were evaluated for safety and efficacy to determine whether these doses warrant further study for improved control of glucose and body weight.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: This 18-week, double-blind, phase 2 trial randomized 318 patients with T2D using >=1500 mg metformin, to receive subcutaneous injection of placebo (n = 82), dulaglutide 1.5 mg (n = 81), dulaglutide 3.0 mg (n = 79) or dulaglutide 4.5 mg (n = 76). The primary objective was superiority of dulaglutide doses over placebo in reduction of HbA1c at 18 weeks. Secondary objectives included superiority of dulaglutide over placebo in change from baseline in body weight and fasting serum glucose (FSG) at 18 weeks. Investigational doses of dulaglutide were compared to the 1.5 mg dose as an exploratory objective.

   RESULTS: HbA1c reduction at 18 weeks was significantly greater with dulaglutide vs placebo (placebo, -0.44% +/- 0.10% [-4.8 +/- 1.1 mmol/mol]; dulaglutide 1.5 mg, -1.23% +/- 0.10% [-13.5 +/- 1.1 mmol/mol]; dulaglutide 3.0 mg, -1.31% +/- 0.10% [-14.3 +/- 1.1 mmol/mol]; dulaglutide 4.5 mg, -1.40% +/- 0.10% [-15.3 +/- 1.1 mmol/mol]; P < 0.001, each dose), as were changes in body weight (placebo, -1.6 +/- 0.39 kg; dulaglutide 1.5 mg, -2.8 +/- 0.39 kg; dulaglutide 3.0 mg, -3.9 +/- 0.39 kg; dulaglutide 4.5 mg, -4.1 +/- 0.41 kg; P < 0.001, each dose). All three dulaglutide doses significantly reduced FSG from baseline (1.5 mg, -36.2 +/- 4.7 mg/dL [-2.0 +/- 0.3 mmol/L]; 3.0 mg, -34.5 +/- 4.5 mg/dL [-1.9 +/- 0.3 mmol/L]; 4.5 mg, -38.0 +/- 4.7 mg/dL [-2.1 +/- 0.3 mmol/L]) vs placebo (-12.4 +/- 4.5 mg/dL [-0.7 +/- 0.3 mmol/L]) (P < 0.001, all). Safety profiles of the higher doses were consistent with the established safety profile for dulaglutide. Gastrointestinal events were mostly mild to moderate, and was dose-related for nausea.

   CONCLUSION: All three dulaglutide doses were superior to placebo in improving glycaemic control and reducing body weight in participants with T2D using metformin. The potential for doses of dulaglutide of 3.0 and 4.5 mg to provide additional glycaemic benefit and weight reduction with an acceptable safety profile, compared with the 1.5 mg dose, warrants further study in a phase 3 trial.

Abstract
  This post hoc analysis of an 18-week randomized trial explored the utility of calculating baseline glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), postprandial glucose (PPG) increments and nocturnal glucose change in predicting efficacy and safety outcomes in response to bolus insulin intensification in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Analyses were conducted on 236 participants with T2D receiving metformin: 116 received fast-acting insulin aspart (faster aspart) basal-bolus therapy and 120 received basal-only insulin. Participants were grouped according to baseline HbA1c, PPG increments and nocturnal glucose change variables; analyses were performed on the end-of-trial treatment differences between "high" and "low" baseline values. The change from baseline in end-of-trial mean HbA1c and mean PPG increments was in favour of faster aspart across all subgroups. Significantly greater treatment differences were observed in participants with high (vs. low) baseline nocturnal glucose change and PPG increments. For baseline HbA1c, significantly greater treatment differences were observed for change in end-of-trial PPG increments, but not end-of-trial HbA1c. In conclusion, both nocturnal glucose change and PPG increments may be more useful than HbA1c for identifying subgroups of people with T2D who would most benefit from bolus intensification.

Abstract
  AIMS: To assess the efficacy and safety of twice-daily insulin degludec/insulin aspart (IDegAsp) versus biphasic insulin aspart 30 (BIAsp 30) twice daily, both +/- metformin, in Chinese adults (N = 543) with type 2 diabetes (T2D) inadequately controlled on premixed/self-mixed or basal insulin +/- metformin.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a 26-week, phase III, open-label, treat-to-target, 2:1 randomized trial. Hierarchical testing was used with non-inferiority of glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) change from baseline to week 26 as the primary endpoint and superiority for the confirmatory secondary endpoints which were as follows: change from baseline in fasting plasma glucose (FPG); nocturnal confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes (12:01-5:59 am, inclusive); total confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes (severe or plasma glucose <3.1 mmol/L with/without symptoms); body weight; and percentage of responders (HbA1c <53 mmol/mol [<7.0%]) without confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes.

   RESULTS: Non-inferiority for change from baseline to week 26 in HbA1c and superiority of IDegAsp twice daily versus BIAsp 30 twice daily for change in FPG, nocturnal confirmed and total confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes, was demonstrated. Estimated rates of nocturnal confirmed and total confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes were 47% and 43% lower, respectively, with IDegAsp twice daily versus BIAsp 30 twice daily. Superiority for change in body weight was not confirmed. Participants were more likely to reach the HbA1c goal of <53 mmol/mol (<7.0%) without confirmed hypoglycaemia with IDegAsp twice daily versus BIAsp 30 twice daily by trial end. No new safety signals were identified.

   CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy and safety of IDegAsp in Chinese patients with T2D was demonstrated, confirming results from international trials. Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Abstract
  AIM: To determine if a 4-week course of 14 mg weekly GLP-1 agonist LY2428757 combined with 3 mg or 2 mg daily gastrin analogue TT223 (LY+TT223) results in long-term glycaemic changes.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with in adequately-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus +/-metformin (N=151) were randomized to a 4-week course of LY+TT223 (3 mg), LY+TT223 (2 mg), LY+TT223 placebo (LY-only) or LY placebo+TT223 placebo (placebo). The primary objective was change in HbA1c from baseline to 5 month safter completion of therapy (i.e. at 6 months) and safety and tolerability with LY+TT223 versus LY-only.

   RESULTS: LY groups showed HbA1c reductions during the active treatment phase. These did not persist during follow-up phase. Combining TT223 with LY did not result in additional glycaemic effects during treatment or follow-up. At 6 months, LSM +/- SE for change in HbA1c from baseline was: LY+TT223 (3 mg): -0.1 +/- 0.2%; LY+TT223 (2 mg): 0.1 +/- 0.2%; LY-only: -0.2 +/- 0.2%; placebo: 0.04 +/- 0.2%. Secondary analyses were consistent with primary results. LY+TT223 was not superior to LY for other time points or end points, including insulin secretory response to mixed meal tolerance tests. The most common adverse events (nausea and vomiting) were more frequent with LY+TT223 versus LY-only. The safety profile was consistent with previous findings.

   CONCLUSION: GLP-1+gastrin combination therapy did not improve glycaemic control versus GLP-1 alone. Copyright © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Abstract
  AIMS: Using a pragmatic approach, the LIRA-PRIME trial aims to address a knowledge gap by comparing efficacy in controlling glycaemia with glucagon-like peptide-1 analog liraglutide vs oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) uncontrolled with metformin monotherapy in primary care practice. We report the study design and patient baseline characteristics.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: This 104-week, two-arm, open-label, active-controlled trial is active in 219 primary care practices across nine countries. At screening, eligible patients with T2D were at least 18 years of age, had been using a stable daily dose of metformin >=1500 mg or the maximum tolerated dose for >=60 days, and had a glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) of 7.5% to 9.0%, measured <=90 days before screening. Patients were randomized (1:1) to liraglutide or OAD, both in addition to pre-trial metformin. Individual OADs were chosen by the treating physician based on local guidelines. The primary endpoint is time to inadequate glycaemic control, defined as HbA1c above 7.0% at two scheduled consecutive visits after the first 26 weeks of treatment.

   RESULTS: The trial randomized 1997 patients with a mean (standard deviation) age of 56.9 (10.8) years, T2D duration of 7.2 (5.9) years (range, <1-47 years), and HbA1c of 8.2%. One-fifth of patients had a history of diabetes complications, and most were overweight (24.8%) or had obesity (65.3%).

   CONCLUSIONS: This pragmatically designed, large-scale, multinational, randomized clinical trial will help guide treatment decisions for patients with T2D who are inadequately controlled with metformin monotherapy and treated in primary care.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: Fixed-ratio combinations of basal insulin plus glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) allow concomitant administration of two proven complementary injectable therapies for type 2 diabetes. This study investigated switching to a titratable fixed-ratio combination of insulin glargine plus lixisenatide (iGlarLixi) in patients with type 2 diabetes receiving daily or weekly GLP-1 RA therapy.

   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: LixiLan-G, a randomized, open-label, 26-week trial, compared switching to iGlarLixi versus continuing prior GLP-1 RA in patients with type 2 diabetes and HbA1c 7-9% (53-75 mmol/mol) taking maximum tolerated doses of a GLP-1 RA daily (60% on liraglutide once daily or exenatide twice daily) or weekly (40% on dulaglutide, exenatide extended release, or albiglutide) with metformin with or without pioglitazone and with or without sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors. Adherence to randomized treatment was closely monitored throughout the study.

   RESULTS: iGlarLixi (n = 257) reduced HbA1c more than continued GLP-1 RA therapy (n = 257) from a baseline 7.8% (62 mmol/mol) in both to 6.7% (50 mmol/mol) and 7.4% (57 mmol/mol), respectively, at 26 weeks (least squares mean difference -0.6%; P < 0.0001). More iGlarLixi patients achieved HbA1c <7% (53 mmol/mol) (62% vs. 26%; P < 0.0001) and the composite of HbA1c <7% without documented symptomatic hypoglycemia (<54 mg/dL). Nausea and vomiting rates as well as numbers of documented symptomatic hypoglycemia events per patient-year were generally low but greater with iGlarLixi versus continued GLP-1 RA therapy.

   CONCLUSIONS: Switching to iGlarLixi improves glucose control for patients with type 2 diabetes insufficiently controlled on a maximum tolerated dose of a GLP-1 RA plus oral antihyperglycemic agents. Copyright © 2019 by the American Diabetes Association.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: GRADE (Glycemia Reduction Approaches in Diabetes: A Comparative Effectiveness Study) is a 36-center unmasked, parallel treatment group, randomized controlled trial evaluating four diabetes medications added to metformin in people with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). We report baseline characteristics and compare GRADE participants to a National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) cohort.

   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Participants were age >=30 years at the time of diagnosis, with duration of T2DM <10 years, HbA1c 6.8-8.5% (51-69 mmol/mol), prescribed metformin monotherapy, and randomized to glimepiride, sitagliptin, liraglutide, or insulin glargine.

   RESULTS: At baseline, GRADE's 5,047 randomized participants were 57.2 +/- 10.0 years of age, 63.6% male, with racial/ethnic breakdown of 65.7% white, 19.8% African American, 3.6% Asian, 2.7% Native American, 7.6% other or unknown, and 18.4% Hispanic/Latino. Duration of diabetes was 4.2 +/- 2.8 years, with mean HbA1c of 7.5 +/- 0.5% (58 +/- 5.3 mmol/mol), BMI of 34.3 +/- 6.8 kg/m2, and metformin dose of 1,944 +/- 204 mg/day. Among the cohort, 67% reported a history of hypertension, 72% a history of hyperlipidemia, and 6.5% a history of heart attack or stroke. Applying GRADE inclusion criteria to NHANES indicates enrollment of a representative cohort with T2DM on metformin monotherapy (NHANES cohort average age, 57.9 years; mean HbA1c, 7.4% [57 mmol/mol]; BMI, 33.2 kg/m2; duration, 4.2 +/- 2.5 years; and 7.2% with a history of cardiovascular disease).

   CONCLUSIONS: The GRADE cohort represents patients with T2DM treated with metformin requiring a second diabetes medication. GRADE will inform decisions about the clinical effectiveness of the addition of four classes of diabetes medications to metformin. Copyright © 2019 by the American Diabetes Association.

Abstract
  Coronary artery disease (CAD) is more frequent among individuals with dysglycemia. Preventive interventions for diabetes can improve cardiometabolic risk factors (CRFs), but it is unclear whether the benefits on CRFs are similar for individuals at different genetic risk for CAD. We built a 201-variant polygenic risk score (PRS) for CAD and tested for interaction with diabetes prevention strategies on 1-year changes in CRFs in 2,658 Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) participants. We also examined whether separate lifestyle behaviors interact with PRS and affect changes in CRFs in each intervention group. Participants in both the lifestyle and metformin interventions had greater improvement in the majority of recognized CRFs compared with placebo (P < 0.001) irrespective of CAD genetic risk (P interaction > 0.05). We detected nominal significant interactions between PRS and dietary quality and physical activity on 1-year change in BMI, fasting glucose, triglycerides, and HDL cholesterol in individuals randomized to metformin or placebo, but none of them achieved the multiple-testing correction for significance. This study confirms that diabetes preventive interventions improve CRFs regardless of CAD genetic risk and delivers hypothesis-generating data on the varying benefit of increasing physical activity and improving diet on intermediate cardiovascular risk factors depending on individual CAD genetic risk profile.

Abstract
  Aim. To compare the effects of once-weekly Dulaglutide with once-daily glargine in poorly oral-antidiabetic controlled patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Method. A total of 25 patients with T2DM admitted into Department of Endocrinology from December 2012 to August 2013 were randomly assigned into two groups: Dulaglutide group (n = 16) and glargine group (n = 9). All patients received either Dulaglutide or glargine treatments for 52 weeks. Continuous glucose monitoring systems (CGMS) were applied to them for two 72 h periods at before and after the treatment each. Patient general clinical data were collected and analyzed. Result. Fast blood glucose (FBG) of the glargine group declined more significantly than the Dulaglutide group after treatment (p < 0.05). The mean blood glucose (MBG), standard deviation of blood glucose (SDBG), mean amplitude of glycemic excursion (MAGE) within a day, the largest amplitude of glycemic excursion (LAGE), M-value, absolute means of daily difference (MODD) of glycemic excursion, the percentage of time (<=2.8 mmol/L, <=3.9 mmol/L, >=10.0 mmol/L, >=13.9 mmol/L, 3.9-7.8 mmol/L, and 9-10.0 mmol/L), maximum glycemic value, and minimum glycemic value were similar between the two groups (p > 0.05). The incidence of hypoglycemia was also similar between the two groups (p > 0.05). Though serum levels of TNF-alpha, IL-6, and 8-PGF2alpha all decreased, significant reduction was found in TNF-alpha and 8-PGF2alpha. TNF-alpha was only significantly reduced in the Dulaglutide group, while 8-PGF2alpha was seen in both groups. Conclusion. For T2DM patients with poorly controlled oral antidiabetic drugs, once-weekly Dulaglutide not only has the same effect on glucose fluctuation as once-daily glargine but also significantly reduced TNF-alpha and 8-PGF2alpha after a 52 week treatment protocol.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Metformin is first-line therapy for type 2 diabetes mellitus, although its effects on the cardiovascular system are unproved.

   METHODS: In this post hoc analysis, patients in SAVOR-TIMI 53 (Saxagliptin and Cardiovascular Outcomes in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus) with baseline biomarker samples (n=12 156) were classified as ever versus never taking metformin during the trial period. Associations between metformin exposure and outcomes were estimated with inverse probability of treatment weighting Cox modeling for the composite end point of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or ischemic stroke, as well as cardiovascular death and all-cause mortality, with biomarkers included as covariates. Additional sensitivity analyses included propensity score matching and Cox multivariable models.

   RESULTS: Of the 12 156 patients with baseline biomarker samples, 8971 (74%) had metformin exposure, 1611 (13%) had prior heart failure, and 1332 (11%) had at least moderate chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate <=45 mL.min-1.1.73 m-2). Metformin use was associated with no difference in risk for the composite end point (hazard ratio for inverse probability of treatment weighting, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.76-1.11]) but lower risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio for inverse probability of treatment weighting, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.59-0.95]). There was no significant relationship between metformin use and these end points in patients with prior heart failure or moderate to severe chronic kidney disease.

   CONCLUSIONS: In a cohort of 12 156 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and high cardiovascular risk, metformin use was associated with lower rates of all-cause mortality, including after adjustment for clinical variables and biomarkers, but not lower rates of the composite end point of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or ischemic stroke. This association was most apparent in patients without prior heart failure or moderate to severe chronic kidney disease.

Abstract
  Cardiovascular and renal outcome trials demonstrate nephroprotection with sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors in people with type 2 diabetes. Attenuation of hyperfiltration is believed to be responsible for the nephroprotection, and studies in young adults with type 1 diabetes suggest that afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction induced by a tubuloglomerular feedback mechanism may be responsible for this effect. The study by van Bommel et al. suggests that this mechanism may not hold true in older adults with type 2 diabetes, who instead attenuate elevated glomerular filtration rate via post-glomerular vasodilation.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: An estimated 4.3 million people aged >= 65 years with diabetes live in Japan. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of linagliptin in older Japanese patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes (T2DM).

   METHODS: In this phase 4, randomised, placebo-controlled national study (part of a global study) conducted in Japan over a period of 52 weeks, 102 patients on stable treatment with basal insulin +/- metformin/alpha-glucosidase inhibitors were randomised (1:1) to receive linagliptin 5 mg qd or placebo. The primary end point was the change in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) after 24 weeks of treatment, with additional analyses at 52 weeks.

   RESULTS: Mean age and HbA1c of the study population were 71 years and 8.1%, respectively. Approximately two-thirds of participants were aged >= 70 years, two-thirds had macrovascular complications, approximately half had a baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2, and two-thirds had a time since diagnosis of diabetes > 10 years. Significant HbA1c reductions with linagliptin vs. placebo were observed at 24 weeks, - 0.71% (95% CI - 0.96, - 0.45, p < 0.0001), and maintained at 52 weeks, - 0.58% (95% CI - 0.82, - 0.34, p < 0.0001). Linagliptin improved the chances of achieving a categorical HbA1c target (< 8.0% and < 7.0%) at 24 and 52 weeks in patients who were not at their respective target at the beginning of the study. Addition of linagliptin to insulin was associated with a numerical increase in the risk of any hypoglycaemia, but not in the risk of clinically significant hypoglycaemia, severe hypoglycaemia or recurring hypoglycaemia.

   CONCLUSION: Linagliptin was effective in improving glucose control in Japanese patients aged >= 60 years with T2DM on stable glucose-lowering therapy with basal insulin. Linagliptin was well tolerated and no new safety concerns were raised. The results presented here are highly consistent with the results from the global study, which was conducted over a 24-week period.

Abstract
  Diabetes-related complications including cardiovascular disease, heart failure (HF), chronic kidney disease, retinopathy, and neuropathy are associated with a high burden of disease. Early initiation of glucose-lowering therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes to achieve glycemic control is important for reduction of not only microvascular risk but also of CV (cardiovascular) risk. Clinical studies have indicated that early achievement of glycemic targets is likely to have the greatest effect on preventing microvascular and macrovascular complications. In addition to improvements in glycemic control and CV risk factors, CV outcomes trials (CVOTs) of empagliflozin (EMPA-REG OUTCOME), canagliflozin (CANVAS), and dapagliflozin (DECLARE-TIMI 58) showed significant glucose-independent reductions in the risk of major adverse CV events and/or hospitalization for HF, as well as reductions in the risk of kidney disease progression, versus placebo. These CVOTs and a renal outcomes study of canagliflozin (CREDENCE) support the early initiation of sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT)-2 inhibitors to potentially provide the most benefit toward glycemic control and CV and renal risk. Thus, current treatment recommendations include the early addition of SGLT-2 inhibitor therapy, not only in patients with established CVD, HF, and/or CKD but also in the general population of patients with T2D.Funding: AstraZeneca.
Other Abstract
  plain-language-summary People with type 2 diabetes (T2D) are at risk of developing complications, including macrovascular [cardiovascular disease (CVD), strokes, and heart failure (HF)] and microvascular [chronic kidney disease (CKD) and damage to the eyes and nerves] conditions. Reduction of blood sugar (glucose) levels (glycemic control) can prevent or halt these complications. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors are a class of glucose-lowering drugs that improve glycemic control, reduce CV (cardiovascular) risk factors such as being overweight and having high blood pressure, and have a low risk of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar levels). Health care providers who treat people with T2D sometimes add SGLT-2 inhibitors after initial treatment with metformin alone. Recently, clinical trials and real-world studies in patients with T2D have shown that SGLT-2 inhibitors (empagliflozin, canagliflozin, and dapagliflozin) reduced the risk of CV events, CV death, and hospitalization for HF and reduced worsening of kidney disease. Although the reduction in CV events with SGLT-2 inhibitor treatment was greatest for patients who already had CVD, the risk was also reduced in those without CVD. Reductions in death from CV causes or hospitalization for HF and kidney events were similar for patients with or without CVD. Some updated treatment guidelines for T2D, therefore, recommend early use of SGLT-2 inhibitors in patients with T2D, not only those with established CVD. This review describes the reasons for starting early treatment with SGLT-2 inhibitors when the potential benefit may be greatest, providing protection against CV events, hospitalization for HF, and progression of CKD.

Abstract
  Background: Type 2 diabetes patients have decreased pancreatic beta cell mass with a decline in beta cell function. Gastrin has increased beta cell proliferation in vitro and in animal studies. High gastric acid levels inhibit gastrin secretion. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) lower gastric acid, subsequently increasing gastrin levels. This may stimulate beta cell proliferation and function, and improve glycemic control. Studies with small numbers of type 2 diabetes patients have shown a slightly lower A1C in those taking PPI versus non-PPI users. Methods: This study was a retrospective multicenter electronic data analysis using data obtained from health care facilities within Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) 21. Patients were included if they had established care within VISN 21 and had type 2 diabetes with an A1C > 6.5%, were started on a PPI concurrently with stable doses of metformin or sulfonylurea (SFU) monotherapy, had at least two documented A1C values, and had a medication possession ratio >80% for metformin, SFU, or a PPI. Veterans were excluded if they were using insulin, combination antihyperglycemic therapy, or oral corticosteroids. A control group not using PPI was also identified. Results: There was a statistically significant decrease in A1C within each group. However, there was no statistically significant difference between the PPI and control group in the post-A1C. Conclusion:  In patients with type 2 diabetes, A1C improved in both groups, but PPI addition did not affect glycemic control. Future randomized controlled trials are needed to determine the value of PPIs as a treatment option for patients with type 2 diabetes.

Abstract
  To investigate the effect of antidiabetic agents on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), 75 patients with T2DM and NAFLD under inadequate glycemic control by metformin were randomized (1:1:1) to receive add-on liraglutide, sitagliptin, or insulin glargine in this 26-week trial. The primary endpoint was the change in intrahepatic lipid (IHL) from baseline to week 26 as quantified by magnetic resonance imaging-estimated proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF). Secondary endpoints included changes in abdominal adiposity (subcutaneous adipose tissue [SAT] and visceral adipose tissue [VAT]), glycated hemoglobin, and body weight from baseline to week 26. We analysed data from intent-to-treat population. MRI-PDFF, VAT, and weight decreased significantly with liraglutide (15.4% +/- 5.6% to 12.5% +/- 6.4%, P < 0.001; 171.4 +/- 27.8 to 150.5 +/- 30.8, P = 0.003; 86.6 +/- 12.9 kg to 82.9 +/- 11.1 kg, P = 0.005, respectively) and sitagliptin (15.5% +/- 5.6% to 11.7% +/- 5.0%, P = 0.001; 153.4 +/- 31.5 to 139.8 +/- 27.3, P = 0.027; 88.2 +/- 13.6 kg to 86.5 +/- 13.2 kg, P = 0.005, respectively). No significant change in MRI-PDFF, VAT, or body weight was observed with insulin glargine. SAT decreased significantly in the liraglutide group (239.9 +/- 69.0 to 211.3 +/- 76.1; P = 0.020) but not in the sitagliptin and insulin glargine groups. Changes from baseline in MRI-PDFF, VAT, and body weight were significantly greater with liraglutide than insulin glargine but did not differ significantly between liraglutide and sitagliptin. Conclusion : Combined with metformin, both liraglutide and sitagliptin, but not insulin glargine, reduced body weight, IHL, and VAT in addition to improving glycemic control in patients with T2DM and NAFLD.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Accumulating evidence suggests that patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and hyperinsulinemia are at an increased risk of developing malignancies. It remains to be fully elucidated whether the use of metformin, an insulin sensitizer, and/or sulfonylureas, insulin secretagogues, affects cancer incidence in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

   OBJECTIVE: A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to compare the risk of cancer incidence associated with monotherapy with metformin compared with monotherapy with sulfonylureas in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients.

   METHODS: Search was performed throughout MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, Google Scholar, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and ClinicalTrials.gov up until December 2018. In this meta-analysis, each raw data (unadjusted) and study-specific (adjusted) relative risks (RRs) was combined and the pooled unadjusted and adjusted RRs with the 95% CI were calculated using the random-effects model with inverse-variance weighting. Heterogeneity among the studies was evaluated using I 2 statistics. Publication bias was evaluated using the funnel plot asymmetry test. The Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS) was used to assess the study quality.

   RESULTS: A total of 8 cohort studies were included in the meta-analysis. Obvious heterogeneity was noted, and monotherapy with metformin was associated with a lower risk of cancer incidence (unadjusted RR = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.55-0.99, I 2 = 97.89%, p < 0.00001; adjusted RR = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.54-1.07, I 2 = 98.12%, p < 0.00001) compared with monotherapy with sulfonylurea, using the random-effects model with inverse-variance weighting.

   CONCLUSIONS: According to this review, the monotherapy with metformin appears to be associated with a lower risk of cancer incidence than monotherapy with sulfonylurea in patients with type 2 diabetes. This analysis is mainly based on cohort studies, and our findings underscore the need for large-scale randomized controlled trials to establish the effect of metformin monotherapy, relative to sulfonylureas monotherapy on cancer.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: two common anti-diabetic treatments used are sitagliptin and sulphonylureas however evidence examining their comparative effectiveness in older people is limited.

   OBJECTIVE: to evaluate effectiveness of sitagliptin vs sulphonylureas when added to metformin in older (aged >=75) vs younger people (18-75).

   DESIGN: retrospective cohort study.

   SETTING: UK Primary Care.

   SUBJECTS: 2,904 individuals prescribed sitagliptin (223 aged>=75) and 13,683 prescribed sulphonylureas (1,725 aged >=75).

   METHODS: multivariable regression to analyse difference in HbA1c and weight, 12 months after add-on initiation and proportion achieving different glycaemic targets.

   RESULTS: after multivariate adjustment to remove baseline differences, the HbA1c after 12 months of treatment was on average 1 mmol/mol (95%CI -0.7 to 2.8) higher with sitagliptin vs sulphonylureas in older people though this was not statistically significant. The weight however, was significantly lower -1.4 kg (95%CI -2.1 to -0.7) with sitagliptin vs sulphonylureas. A lower proportion prescribed sitagliptin vs sulphonylureas recorded HbA1c < 48 mmol/mol by study end: Odds Ratio 0.63 (95%CI 0.42-0.95). In younger people, similar HbA1c reductions were also observed with both treatments, however weight after 12 months was even lower with sitagliptin vs sulphonylureas: -2.3 kg (95%CI -2.5 to -2.0).

   CONCLUSIONS: similar HbA1c reduction was observed when sitagliptin or sulphonylureas were added to metformin in older and younger age-groups. Sitagliptin use led to modest comparative weight loss. There may be greater risk of over-treatment with sulphonylureas evidenced by greater proportion recording HbA1c < 48 mmol/mol by study end. This evidence supporting use of sitagliptin when add-on therapy is selected in older adults should be considered alongside the wider evidence-base and patient-preference.

Abstract
  Objective: To assess the safety and efficacy of ertugliflozin over 104 weeks in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) inadequately controlled on metformin. Methods: In this double-blind, multicenter, randomized, phase III study (VERTIS SU; NCT01999218), adults with T2DM and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) 7.0-9.0% on metformin >=1500 mg/day received ertugliflozin 5 mg or 15 mg, or glimepiride. The primary efficacy time point was Week 52; double-blinded treatment continued until Week 104. Results: Baseline characteristics of randomized, treated patients (n = 1315) were similar across groups (mean age 58.2 years, HbA1c 7.8%); 76.4% completed the study; 61.6% completed on study medication. Mean glimepiride dose at 104 weeks was 3.5 mg/day. At Week 104, least squares mean change from baseline in HbA1c (95% confidence intervals) were -0.3% (-0.4, -0.2), -0.4% (-0.5, -0.3) and -0.4% (-0.5, -0.3) for ertugliflozin 5 mg, 15 mg, and glimepiride, respectively. Ertugliflozin provided sustained reductions in body weight and systolic blood pressure (SBP) over 104 weeks. The incidence of adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs was similar across groups. The incidence of symptomatic hypoglycemia was 3.8%, 6.4% and 22.1% in the ertugliflozin 5 mg, 15 mg, and glimepiride groups, respectively. Genital mycotic infections were reported in 5.3%, 2.6% and 0% of men, respectively, and 9.2%, 12.3% and 1.4% of women, respectively. The incidence of urinary tract infection and hypovolemia AEs was similar across groups. Conclusions: Ertugliflozin was well tolerated and provided clinically meaningful glycemic control and durable reductions in body weight and SBP over 104 weeks.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is associated with increased risk of colon cancer (CC), whereas metformin use seems to be protective. However, the impact of metformin use on the risk of death or disease recurrence after radical surgery for CC remains uncertain.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a substudy conducted in patients with high-risk stage II or stage III CC randomized in the TOSCA trial, which compared 3 versus 6 months of fluoropyrimidine-oxaliplatin adjuvant chemotherapy. Objective of the study was to investigate the impact of metformin exposure during adjuvant chemotherapy on overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS). We also evaluated the impact of T2DM or metformin dosage on clinical outcomes.

   RESULTS: Out of 3,759 patients enrolled in the TOSCA trial, 133 patients with diabetes (9.2%) and 1,319 without diabetes (90.8%) were recruited in this study. After excluding 13 patients with diabetes without information on metformin exposure, 76 patients with T2DM (63.3%) were defined as metformin users and 44 (36.7%) as metformin nonusers. After a median follow-up of 60.4 months, 26 (21.7%) patients relapsed and 16 (13.3%) died. Metformin use was neither associated with OS (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.48-4.77; p = .4781) nor with RFS (HR, 1.56; 95% CI, 0.69-3.54; p = .2881). Similarly, we found no association between T2DM or metformin dosage and OS or RFS.

   CONCLUSIONS: Metformin use and T2DM did not impact on OS or RFS in patients with resected CC treated with adjuvant fluoropyrimidine-oxaliplatin chemotherapy. Larger studies and longer follow-up are required to clarify the potential efficacy of metformin in improving the prognosis of patients with CC.

   IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The role of the antidiabetic drug metformin in colon cancer prevention and treatment is highly debated. While low-dose metformin reduced the incidence of colorectal adenomas in two prospective studies, its effect in patients with already established colon cancer remains unclear. In this study, the potential impact of metformin on the survival of resected colon cancer patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy was investigated in the context of the TOSCA study. We did not find any association between metformin use or dosages and patient survival. Prospective studies are required to draw definitive conclusions about metformin impact on colon cancer recurrence and survival. Copyright © AlphaMed Press 2019.

Abstract
  AIMS: Our study aimed to analyse treatment strategies after failure of initial metformin mono-therapy in adult patients with type-2 diabetes (T2DM).

   METHODS: The DIVE and DPV databases were combined and 16,681 adult patients with T2DM and metformin mono-therapy identified. Patients were analysed depending on whether metformin was continued (MET), or whether it was combined with other oral antidiabetics (OAD), with GLP-1 antagonists (GLP-1) or with basal insulin (BOT/BOT plus). Metabolic control, body weight and hypoglycaemia, micro- and macro-vascular events were compared within 1 year.

   RESULTS: A total of 11,911 (71%) participants continued MET until the end of the observation period, 3334 (20.0%) were intensified using OAD, 579 (3%) started on GLP-1, and 857 (5%) were initiated on BOT/BOTplus. Predictors of OAD and BOT/BOTplus therapy were elevated HbA1c, longer diabetes duration and the presence of micro- and macro-vascular diseases, while GLP-1 therapy was predicted by younger age, female sex, higher body weight and shorter diabetes duration. Micro- and macro-vascular diseases were negative predictors of GLP-1 therapy. Effects on HbA1c were highest in the BOT/BOTplus and OAD group, while GLP-1 treatment had the best effect on body weight.

   CONCLUSIONS: BOT/BOTplus and OAD show good HbA1c reduction even in patients with longer diabetes duration and in older patients. GLP-1 therapy is effective concerning weight loss in overweight patients and is more often used in females and patients with shorter diabetes duration. Interestingly, despite several studies showing positive effects on micro- and macro-vascular outcomes, prevalent macro-vascular diseases are no predictors of GLP-1 use.

Abstract
  Ertugliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus, is expected to be coadministered with sitagliptin, metformin, glimepiride, and/or simvastatin. Four separate open-label, randomized, single-dose, crossover studies were conducted in healthy adults to assess the potential pharmacokinetic interactions between ertugliflozin 15 mg and sitagliptin 100 mg (n = 12), metformin 1000 mg (n = 18), glimepiride 1 mg (n = 18), or simvastatin 40 mg (n = 18). Noncompartmental pharmacokinetic parameters derived from plasma concentration-time data were analyzed using mixed-effects models to assess interactions. Coadministration of sitagliptin, metformin, glimepiride, or simvastatin with ertugliflozin had no effect on area under the plasma concentration-time profile from time 0 to infinity (AUCinf ) or maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax ) of ertugliflozin (per standard bioequivalence boundaries, 80% to 125%). Similarly, ertugliflozin did not have any impact on AUCinf or Cmax of sitagliptin, metformin, or glimepiride. AUCinf for simvastatin (24%) and simvastatin acid (30%) increased slightly after coadministration with ertugliflozin and was not considered clinically relevant. All treatments were well tolerated. The lack of clinically meaningful pharmacokinetic interactions demonstrates that ertugliflozin can be coadministered safely with sitagliptin, metformin, glimepiride, or simvastatin without any need for dose adjustment.

Abstract
  The aim of this article is to review and present the most important studies published in the field of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) during 2018. These studies were presented in a lecture given on this topic at the Endorama Meeting in Patras, Greece, in January 2019. In order to identify the most important and relevant articles, a search in the English language was conducted in PubMed for publications up to the end of December 2018, with special attention paid to publications in high impact factor journals. The highlights of the main Diabetes Meetings [ADA (American Diabetes Association) and EASD (European Association of Diabetes)], as well as Medscape, were also reviewed. Last but not least, press releases regarding advances in the diagnosis and treatment of T2DM were considered. We finally selected and discussed important studies concerning diagnosis, pathophysiology, and management of this very common clinical entity (19 studies). The majority of studies were clinical trials dealing with new therapeutic tools for treatment of the disease, with the greatest focus being on GLP-1RA. We also presented in brief the main points of new guidelines published for T2DM by various scientific societies (3 sets of guidelines). During 2018, not only leading diabetes associations published guidelines on the disease, but also societies belonging to other primary scientific fields. This is indicative of the awareness of physicians and scientists that T2DM constitutes today a major health problem and of the need for public health strategies for its treatment and prevention.

Abstract
  AIM: Phase III, randomized, double-blind study evaluating the efficacy and safety of ertugliflozin in Asian patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) inadequately controlled on metformin, including evaluation in the China subpopulation.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 26-week, double-blind study of 506 Asian patients (80.2% from mainland China), randomized 1:1:1 to placebo, ertugliflozin 5- or 15 mg, was performed. Primary endpoint was change from baseline in HbA1c at week 26. Secondary endpoints were change from baseline at week 26 in fasting plasma glucose (FPG), body weight (BW), systolic/diastolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP), and proportion of patients with HbA1c <7.0%. Hypotheses for the primary endpoint and FPG and BW secondary endpoints were tested in the China subpopulation.

   RESULTS: At week 26, least squares mean (95% CI) change from baseline HbA1c was significantly greater with ertugliflozin 5- and 15 mg versus placebo: -1.0% (-1.1, -0.9), -0.9% (-1.0, -0.8), -0.2% (-0.3, -0.1), respectively. Ertugliflozin significantly reduced FPG, BW and SBP. Reductions in DBP with ertugliflozin were not significant. At week 26, 16.2%, 38.2% and 40.8% of patients had HbA1c <7.0% with placebo, ertugliflozin 5- and 15 mg, respectively. 59.3%, 56.5% and 53.3% of patients experienced adverse events with placebo, ertugliflozin 5- and 15 mg, respectively. Incidence of symptomatic hypoglycaemia was higher for ertugliflozin 15 mg vs placebo. Results in the China subpopulation were consistent.

   CONCLUSIONS: Ertugliflozin significantly improved glycaemic control and reduced BW and SBP in Asian patients with T2DM. Ertugliflozin was generally well-tolerated. Results in the China subpopulation were consistent with the overall population. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02630706. Copyright © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Abstract
  AIMS: Insulin-treated patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity are challenged in achieving body weight stability or reduction, in addition to glycaemic control. Post-hoc analyses of body weight and insulin dose data from the AWARD-4 trial involved comparison of treatment with once-weekly dulaglutide 1.5 mg (N = 295) or 0.75 mg (N = 293) and treatment with daily insulin glargine (N = 296), each with prandial insulin lispro (+/- metformin).

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Changes in weight and in the proportion of patients without weight gain or with weight loss of at least 3%, 5% or 10% or composites of HbA1c less than 7% without weight gain and weight loss of at least 3% after 52 weeks were compared between the dulaglutide (either dose) groups and the insulin glargine group, overall and by baseline BMI (<30, 30-<35, >=35 kg/m2 ), using analysis of covariance and logistic regression, including interaction terms.

   RESULTS: The following parameters were statistically significant (P < 0.01) in favour of the dulaglutide-treated groups, at lower mean total daily insulin doses, vs the insulin glargine group. The achieved targets were more pronounced with dulaglutide 1.5 mg than with insulin glargine: LSM weight change difference, -3.23 kg; proportion of patients without weight gain, 49.0% vs 19.0%; proportion of patients with weight loss >=3%, 21.7% vs 5.7% or with weight loss >=5%, 10.5% vs 2.4%; proportion of patients with HbA1c <7% without weight gain, 26.2% vs 7.9%; proportion of patients with HbA1c <7% and weight loss >=3%, 11.9% vs 1.4%, respectively. Treatment effect for these parameters was not significantly different across BMI categories.

   CONCLUSIONS: Larger proportions of patients in late-stage T2D needing treatment intensification achieved glycemic control without weight gain or with weight loss at lower insulin doses with once-weekly dulaglutide plus daily prandial insulin than with a basal-bolus insulin regimen, overall and across all three BMI subgroups.

Abstract
  AIMS: A post-hoc analysis to assess the impact in people with type 2 diabetes, of increasing doses of basal insulin on glycaemic measures, body weight and hypoglycaemia.

   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We included data from prospective, randomized controlled treat-to-target trials of >=24 weeks' duration in people with type 2 diabetes, uncontrolled on metformin and sulphonylureas, and treated with insulin glargine 100 units/mL (U100), who had at least six fasting plasma glucose (FPG) measurements. The impact of insulin dose on glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) values, FPG, hypoglycaemia incidence (<3.9 mmol/L [70 mg/dL]), and body weight was analysed. A total of 458 participants from three eligible trials were included.

   RESULTS: The observed relationship between higher basal insulin doses and glycaemic control was non-linear, with increasing insulin dose leading to smaller reductions in FPG and HbA1c for doses >0.3 IU/kg/d, with a plateauing effect at 0.5 IU/kg/d. Total daily dose of insulin >0.5 IU/kg/d resulted in greater weight gain, but without higher rates of hypoglycaemia, compared with insulin doses <=0.5 IU/kg/d.

   CONCLUSIONS: This analysis indicates that basal insulin doses >0.5 IU/kg/d have diminishing additional impact on improving glycaemic measures, with the disadvantage of additional weight gain. Clinicians should consider anti-hyperglycaemic treatment intensification at doses approaching 0.5 IU/kg/d. Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Abstract
  AIMS: This meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the fracture risk among patients with T2DM treated with sulfonylurea.

   METHODS: The PubMed and other databases were searched for eligible studies. Both randomized controlled trials and observational studies that compared the fracture risk of sulfonylurea to other hypoglycemic agents were included. Pooled risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Subgroup analysis and meta-regression analyses were conducted to explore the source of heterogeneity.

   RESULTS: A total of 11 studies involving 255,644 individuals were included in our meta-analysis. In comparing sulfonylurea users with patients who had not taken sulfonylurea, the pooled risk ratio for developing fracture was 1.14 (95% confifidence interval, 1.08-1.19). In subgroup analyses, the pooled risk ratio of bone fracture in patients receiving sulfonylurea versus thiazolidinedione, metformin and insulin was 0.90 (95% CI, 0.76-1.06), 1.25 (95% CI, 1.18-1.32) and 0.81 (95% CI, 0.74-0.89) respectively. Meta regression showed that age and gender were not related to the effect of sulfonylurea on fracture.

   CONCLUSIONS: Sulfonylurea use was associated with 14% increase in the risk of developing fracture in T2DM. The risk of fracture caused by sulfonylurea was similar to thiazolidinedione, higher than metformin and lower than insulin. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Novartis Access is a Novartis programme that offers a portfolio of non-communicable disease medicines at a wholesale price of US$1 per treatment per month in low-income and middle-income countries. We evaluated the effect of Novartis Access in Kenya, the first country to receive the programme.

   METHODS: We did a cluster-randomised controlled trial in eight counties in Kenya. Counties (clusters) were randomly assigned to the intervention or the control group with a covariate-constrained randomisation procedure that maximised balance on a set of demographic and health variables. In intervention counties, public and non-profit health facilities were allowed to purchase Novartis Access medicines from the Mission for Essential Drugs and Supplies (MEDS). Data were collected from all facilities served by MEDS and a sample of households in study counties. Households were eligible if they had at least one adult patient who had been diagnosed and prescribed medicines for one of the non-communicable diseases targeted by the programme: hypertension, heart failure, dyslipidaemia, type 2 diabetes, asthma, or breast cancer. Primary outcomes were availability and price of portfolio medicines at health facilities, irrespective of brand; and availability of medicines at patient households. Impacts were estimated with intention-to-treat analysis. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02773095).

   FINDINGS: On March 8, 2016, we randomly assigned eight clusters to intervention (four clusters; 74 health facilities; 342 patients) or control (four clusters; 63 health facilities; 297 patients). 69 intervention and 58 control health facilities, and 306 intervention and 265 control patients were evaluated after a 15 month intervention period (last visit February 28, 2018). Novartis Access significantly increased the availability of amlodipine (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.84, 95% CI 1.10 to 7.37; p=0.031) and metformin (aOR 4.78, 95% CI 1.44 to 15.86; p=0.011) at health facilities, but did not affect the availability of portfolio medicines overall (adjusted beta [abeta] 0.05, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.10; p=0.096) or their price (abeta 0.48, 95% CI -1.12 to 0.72; p=0.500). The programme did not affect medicine availability at patient households (aOR 0.83, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.57; p=0.569).

   INTERPRETATION: Novartis Access had little effect in its first year in Kenya. Access programmes operate within complex health systems and reducing the wholesale price of medicines might not always or immediately translate to improved patient access. The evidence generated by this study will inform Novartis's efforts to improve their programme going forward. The study also contributes to the public evidence base on strategies for improving access to medicines globally.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: We aimed to investigate the effectiveness and safety of adding basal insulin to initiating dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor and metformin and/or sulfonylurea (SU) in achieving the target glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

   METHODS: This was a single-arm, multicenter, 24-week, open-label, phase 4 study in patients with inadequately controlled (HbA1c >=7.5%) T2DM despite the use of DPP-4 inhibitor and metformin. A total of 108 patients received insulin glargine while continuing oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs). The primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage of subjects achieving HbA1c <=7.0%. Other glycemic profiles were also evaluated, and the safety endpoints were adverse events (AEs) and hypoglycemia.

   RESULTS: The median HbA1c at baseline (8.9%; range, 7.5% to 11.1%) decreased to 7.6% (5.5% to 11.7%) at 24 weeks. Overall, 31.7% subjects (n=33) achieved the target HbA1c level of <=7.0%. The mean differences in body weight and fasting plasma glucose were 1.2+/-3.4 kg and 56.0+/-49.8 mg/dL, respectively. Hypoglycemia was reported in 36 subjects (33.3%, 112 episodes), all of which were fully recovered. There was no serious AE attributed to insulin glargine. Body weight change was significantly different between SU users and nonusers (1.5+/-2.5 kg vs. -0.9+/-6.0 kg, P=0.011).

   CONCLUSION: The combination add-on therapy of insulin glargine, on metformin and DPP-4 inhibitors with or without SU was safe and efficient in reducing HbA1c levels and thus, is a preferable option in managing T2DM patients exhibiting dysglycemia despite the use of OADs.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To examine whether metformin use was associated with knee cartilage volume loss over 4 years and risk of total knee replacement over 6 years in obese individuals with knee osteoarthritis.

   METHODS: This study analysed the Osteoarthritis Initiative participants with radiographic knee osteoarthritis (Kellgren-Lawrence grade >= 2) who were obese (body mass index [BMI] >= 30 kg/m2). Participants were classified as metformin users if they self-reported regular metformin use at baseline, 1-year and 2-year follow-up (n = 56). Non-users of metformin were defined as participants who did not report the use of metformin at any visit from baseline to 4-year follow-up (n = 762). Medial and lateral cartilage volume (femoral condyle and tibial plateau) were assessed using magnetic resonance imaging at baseline and 4 years. Total knee replacement over 6 years was assessed. General linear model and binary logistic regression were used for statistical analyses.

   RESULTS: The rate of medial cartilage volume loss was lower in metformin users compared with non-users (0.71% vs. 1.57% per annum), with a difference of - 0.86% per annum (95% CI - 1.58% to - 0.15%, p = 0.02), after adjustment for age, gender, BMI, pain score, Kellgren-Lawrence grade, self-reported diabetes, and weight change over 4 years. Metformin use was associated with a trend towards a significant reduction in risk of total knee replacement over 6 years (odds ratio 0.30, 95% CI 0.07-1.30, p = 0.11), after adjustment for age, gender, BMI, Kellgren-Lawrence grade, pain score, and self-reported diabetes.

   CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that metformin use may have a beneficial effect on long-term knee joint outcomes in those with knee osteoarthritis and obesity. Randomised controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings and determine whether metformin would be a potential disease-modifying drug for knee osteoarthritis with the obese phenotype.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: Combining antihyperglycemic agents in order to rapidly and safely achieve the best possible glycemic control is the standard of care today for the management of type 2 diabetes. Agents should ideally have mechanisms of actions that are complementary and that improve glycemic control without unacceptable gain in body weight or hypoglycemia. Areas covered: Ertugliflozin and metformin hydrochloride (ertugliflozin/metformin, SEGLUROMET) is a recently approved fixed-dose combination tablet containing the sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor ertugliflozin and metformin. This review summarizes key characteristics of ertugliflozin and metformin, as well as the efficacy and safety results of co-administration of these agents in the ertugliflozin clinical development program. This information comes from the ertugliflozin/metformin prescribing information as well as published clinical trials obtained through a PubMed search. Expert commentary: SGLT-2 inhibitors are an important class of antihyperglycemic agents that are efficacious as monotherapy and in combination with other antihyperglycemic agents. Given their favorable effects on glycemia control as well as 'extra-glycemic' parameters such as body weight and blood pressure, they are ideal agents for appropriate patients with type 2 diabetes. The fixed-dose combination of ertugliflozin with metformin is an effective combination that is conveniently administered and may improve medication adherence and persistence.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Existing guidelines for management of type 2 diabetes recommend a patient-centred approach to guide the choice of pharmacological agents. Although glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are increasingly used as second-line agents, direct comparisons between these treatments are insufficient. In the SUSTAIN 8 trial, we compared the efficacy and safety of semaglutide (a GLP-1 receptor agonist) with canagliflozin (an SGLT2 inhibitor) in patients with type 2 diabetes.

   METHODS: This was a double-blind, parallel-group, phase 3b, randomised controlled trial done at 111 centres in 11 countries. Eligible patients were at least 18 years old and had uncontrolled type 2 diabetes (HbA1c 7.0-10.5% [53-91 mmol/mol]) on stable daily metformin therapy. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) by use of an interactive web response system to subcutaneous semaglutide 1.0 mg once weekly or oral canagliflozin 300 mg once daily. The primary endpoint was change from baseline in HbA1c, and the confirmatory secondary endpoint was change from baseline in bodyweight, both at week 52. The primary analysis population included all randomly assigned patients, using on-treatment data collected before initiation of rescue medication. The safety analysis was done on a population that included all patients exposed to at least one dose of trial product. The trial was powered for HbA1c and bodyweight superiority under reasonable assumptions. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03136484.

   FINDINGS: Between March 15, 2017, and Nov 16, 2018, 788 patients were randomly assigned to semaglutide 1.0 mg (394 patients) or canagliflozin 300 mg (394 patients). 739 patients completed the trial (367 in the semaglutide group and 372 in the canagliflozin group). From overall baseline mean, patients receiving semaglutide had significantly greater reductions in HbA1c and bodyweight than those receiving canagliflozin (HbA1c estimated treatment difference [ETD] -0.49 percentage points, 95% CI -0.65 to -0.33; -5.34 mmol/mol, 95% CI -7.10 to -3.57; p<0.0001; and bodyweight ETD -1.06 kg, 95% CI -1.76 to -0.36; p=0.0029). Gastrointestinal disorders, most commonly nausea, were the most frequently reported adverse events with semaglutide, occurring in 184 (47%) of 392 patients; whereas infections and infestations (defined using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, version 21.0), most commonly urinary tract infections, occurred more frequently with canagliflozin, in 136 (35%) of 394 patients. Premature treatment discontinuation because of adverse events occurred in 38 (10%) of 392 patients with semaglutide and in 20 (5%) of 394 patients with canagliflozin. One fatal adverse event confirmed unlikely to be caused by treatment occurred in the semaglutide group.

   INTERPRETATION: Once-weekly semaglutide 1.0 mg was superior to daily canagliflozin 300 mg in reducing HbA1c and bodyweight in patients with type 2 diabetes uncontrolled on metformin therapy. These outcomes might guide treatment intensification choices.

Abstract
  PURPOSE: Nature is a phenomenal treasure of remedies. Numerous previous studies reported that Nigella sativa NS improved glycemic control, reduced insulin resistance, and improved lipid profile. NS was never investigated before as a monotherapy for newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus T2DM patients. Our aim was to investigate the potential metabolic benefits of NS monotherapy in newly diagnosed T2DM patients.

   METHOD: Prospective, open-label randomized clinical trial at outpatient endocrinology clinic at Ain-Shams University hospital. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to either metformin tablets or NS oil capsules. Both groups received treatment for 3 months. Glycemic index (FBG, 2 h pp, A1C, insulin sensitivity %S, secretory function %B, insulin resistance IR), lipid profile (TC, LDL, HDL, TG), liver and kidney functions (AST, ALT, Sr cr), total antioxidant capacity TAC, weight, waist circumference WC and body mass index BMI were assessed at baseline and at the end of treatment period.

   RESULTS: A concentration of 1350 mg/day NS in newly diagnosed T2DM patients was inferior to metformin in terms of lowering FBG, 2 h pp, and A1C or increasing %B. However, NS was comparable to metformin in lowering weight, WC, and BMI significantly. NS was comparable to metformin in regards of their effects on fasting insulin, %S, IR, ALT, TC, LDL, HDL, TG, and TAC. Metformin showed significant increase in AST and creatinine which was reserved in NS group.

   CONCLUSION: NS administration in newly diagnosed T2DM was tolerable with no side effects as compared to metformin; however, it was inferior to metformin in terms of diabetes management.

Abstract
  CONTEXT: Hypoglycemic drugs with proven cardiovascular (CV) benefits are recommended for patients with type 2 diabetes and CV disease. Whether the beneficial effects extend to those at lower risk remains unclear.

   AIM: We investigated the long-term CV effects of pioglitazone or sulfonylureas (SUs) across the spectrum of pretreatment CV risk.

   METHODS: Among 2820 participants of the TOSCA.IT trial, four subgroups with different risk of outcome-a composite of all-cause death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, urgent coronary revascularization-were identified by the RECursive Partitioning and AMalgamation (RECPAM) method. Within each group, the effect of SUs or pioglitazone on the outcome was evaluated.

   RESULTS: Sex was the first splitting variable, followed by urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) (>9 mg/g or <=9 mg/g) and body mass index (BMI) (>28.7 or <=28.7 kg/m2). Female patients had the lowest risk (reference); male patients with UACR >9 mg/g and BMI >28.7 kg/m2 had the highest risk [hazard ratio (HR), 5.58; 95% CI, 3.32 to 9.69]. Patients in this group present a cluster of conditions suggestive of marked insulin resistance (higher BMI, waist circumference, triglycerides, blood pressure, and UACR and lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol) than the other groups. Treatment with pioglitazone in this group was associated with a significantly lower occurrence of the outcome than SUs (HR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.25 to 0.76). No significant difference between study treatments was observed in the other RECPAM classes.

   CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to identify patients with type 2 diabetes early in the stage of their disease and who are largely free from evident CV disease in whom add-on pioglitazone to metformin confers CV protection as compared with SUs. Copyright © 2019 Endocrine Society.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Semaglutide is a once-weekly glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue for type 2 diabetes. Few clinical trials have reported on the concomitant use of GLP-1 receptor agonists with sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors. We aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of semaglutide when added to SGLT-2 inhibitor therapy in patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes.

   METHODS: The SUSTAIN 9 double-blind, parallel-group trial was done at 61 centres in six countries (Austria, Canada, Japan, Norway, Russia, and the USA). Adults with type 2 diabetes and HbA1c 7.0-10.0% (53-86 mmol/mol), despite at least 90 days of treatment with an SGLT-2 inhibitor, were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive subcutaneous semaglutide 1.0 mg or volume-matched placebo once weekly for 30 weeks, after a dose-escalation schedule of 4 weeks of 0.25 mg semaglutide or placebo and 4 weeks of 0.5 mg semaglutide or placebo. Existing antidiabetic medications, including SGLT-2 inhibitor treatment, were continued for the duration of the trial. Rescue medication, defined as intensification of background antidiabetic treatment or the initiation of new glucose-lowering medications, could be given to patients meeting specific criteria at the discretion of the investigator. The primary outcome was change in HbA1c from baseline at week 30, assessed in the full analysis set (all patients randomly allocated to treatment) using on-treatment data collected before rescue medication was started. The confirmatory secondary outcome was change in bodyweight from baseline to week 30. Safety was also assessed in the safety analysis set (all patients who received at least one dose of treatment). The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03086330).

   FINDINGS: Between March 15, and Dec 4, 2017, 302 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive semaglutide 1.0 mg or placebo (full analysis set), of whom 301 received at least one dose of treatment (safety analysis set). One patient was assigned to semaglutide but was not treated (reason unknown). 294 (97.4%) patients completed the trial and 267 (88.4%) completed treatment. Baseline characteristics were generally comparable between groups. In addition to randomised medication and SGLT-2 inhibitor, 216 (71.5%) patients were taking metformin and 39 (12.9%) were taking sulphonylurea. Patients given semaglutide had greater reductions in HbA1c (estimated treatment difference -1.42% [95% CI -1.61 to -1.24]; -15.55 mmol/mol [-17.54 to -13.56]) and bodyweight (-3.81 kg [-4.70 to -2.93]) versus those randomised to placebo (both p<0.0001). 356 adverse events were reported by 104 (69.3%) patients in the semaglutide group, and 247 adverse events were reported by 91 (60.3%) patients in the placebo group. Gastrointestinal adverse events were most common and were reported in 56 (37.3%) patients in the semaglutide group and 20 (13.2%) in the placebo group. Serious adverse events occurred in seven (4.7%) patients in the semaglutide group and six (4.0%) in the placebo group. Severe or blood glucose-confirmed hypoglycaemic events were reported in four patients on semaglutide (2.7%). 16 patients stopped treatment early because of an adverse event, 13 of whom were in the semaglutide group. There were no deaths during the trial.

   INTERPRETATION: Adding semaglutide to SGLT-2 inhibitor therapy significantly improves glycaemic control and reduces bodyweight in patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes, and is generally well tolerated.

Abstract
  We read with interest a recent article written by Yan et al.(1) The authors conducted a randomized trial in patients with coexisting type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) to receive liraglutide, sitagliptin, or insulin glargine as add-on to metformin. The authors observed glycemic control and a reduction in body weight, intrahepatic lipid, and visceral adipose tissue in patients who received liraglutide or sitagliptin and then reported these add-on therapies to be novel pharmacotherapeutic therapies in patients with NAFLD and T2DM. However, the clinical meaningfulness of these pharmacologic treatments has not been conclusively established, especially since histopathology was not used to diagnose and determine the severity of NAFLD in that study.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Research using data-driven cluster analysis has proposed five subgroups of diabetes with differences in diabetes progression and risk of complications. We aimed to compare the clinical utility of this subgroup-based approach for predicting patient outcomes with an alternative strategy of developing models for each outcome using simple patient characteristics.

   METHODS: We identified five clusters in the ADOPT trial (n=4351) using the same data-driven cluster analysis as reported by Ahlqvist and colleagues. Differences between clusters in glycaemic and renal progression were investigated and contrasted with stratification using simple continuous clinical features (age at diagnosis for glycaemic progression and baseline renal function for renal progression). We compared the effectiveness of a strategy of selecting glucose-lowering therapy using clusters with one combining simple clinical features (sex, BMI, age at diagnosis, baseline HbA1c) in an independent trial cohort (RECORD [n=4447]).

   FINDINGS: Clusters identified in trial data were similar to those described in the original study by Ahlqvist and colleagues. Clusters showed differences in glycaemic progression, but a model using age at diagnosis alone explained a similar amount of variation in progression. We found differences in incidence of chronic kidney disease between clusters; however, estimated glomerular filtration rate at baseline was a better predictor of time to chronic kidney disease. Clusters differed in glycaemic response, with a particular benefit for thiazolidinediones in patients in the severe insulin-resistant diabetes cluster and for sulfonylureas in patients in the mild age-related diabetes cluster. However, simple clinical features outperformed clusters to select therapy for individual patients.

   INTERPRETATION: The proposed data-driven clusters differ in diabetes progression and treatment response, but models that are based on simple continuous clinical features are more useful to stratify patients. This finding suggests that precision medicine in type 2 diabetes is likely to have most clinical utility if it is based on an approach of using specific phenotypic measures to predict specific outcomes, rather than assigning patients to subgroups.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Oral semaglutide is the first oral glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist for glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is commonly associated with renal impairment, restricting treatment options. We aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of oral semaglutide in patients with type 2 diabetes and moderate renal impairment.

   METHODS: This randomised, double-blind, phase 3a trial was undertaken at 88 sites in eight countries. Patients aged 18 years and older, with type 2 diabetes, an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 30-59 mL/min per 1.73 m2, and who had been receiving a stable dose of metformin or sulfonylurea, or both, or basal insulin with or without metformin for the past 90 days were eligible. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) by use of an interactive web-response system, with stratification by glucose-lowering medication and renal function, to receive oral semaglutide (dose escalated to 14 mg once daily) or matching placebo for 26 weeks, in addition to background medication. Participants and site staff were masked to assignment. Two efficacy-related estimands were defined: treatment policy (regardless of treatment discontinuation or rescue medication) and trial product (on treatment without rescue medication) in all participants randomly assigned. Endpoints were change from baseline to week 26 in HbA1c (primary endpoint) and bodyweight (confirmatory secondary endpoint), assessed in all participants with sufficient data. Safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one dose of study drug. This trial is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02827708, and the European Clinical Trials Registry, number EudraCT 2015-005326-19, and is now complete.

   FINDINGS: Between Sept 20, 2016, and Sept 29, 2017, of 721 patients screened, 324 were eligible and randomly assigned to oral semaglutide (n=163) or placebo (n=161). Mean age at baseline was 70 years (SD 8), and 168 (52%) of participants were female. 133 (82%) participants in the oral semaglutide group and 141 (88%) in the placebo group completed 26 weeks on treatment. At 26 weeks, oral semaglutide was superior to placebo in decreasing HbA1c (estimated mean change of -1.0 percentage point (SE 0.1; -11 mmol/mol [SE 0.8]) vs -0.2 percentage points (SE 0.1; -2 mmol/mol [SE 0.8]); estimated treatment difference [ETD]: -0.8 percentage points, 95% CI -1.0 to -0.6; p<0.0001) and bodyweight (estimated mean change of -3.4 kg [SE 0.3] vs -0.9 kg [SE 0.3]; ETD, -2.5, 95% CI -3.2 to -1.8; p<0.0001) by the treatment policy estimand. Significant differences were seen for the trial product estimand: mean change in HbA1c -1.1 percentage points (SE 0.1; -12 mmol/mol [SE 0.8] versus -0.1 percentage points (SE 0.1; -1 mmol/mol [SE 0.8]; ETD -1.0 percentage points, 95% CI -1.2 to -0.8; p<0.0001); mean change in bodyweight -3.7 kg (SE 0.3) versus -1.1 kg (SE 0.3; ETD -2.7 kg, 95% CI -3.5 to -1.9; p<0.0001). More patients taking oral semaglutide than placebo had adverse events (120 [74%] of 163 vs 105 [65%] of 161), and discontinued treatment as a result (24 [15%] vs eight [5%]). Gastrointestinal events, mainly mild-to-moderate nausea, were more common with oral semaglutide than with placebo. Three deaths occurred during the treatment period that were not condsidered to be treatment related, one in the semaglutide group and two in the placebo group.

   INTERPRETATION: Oral semaglutide was effective in patients with type 2 diabetes and moderate renal impairment, potentially providing a new treatment option for this population. Safety, including renal safety, was consistent with the GLP-1 receptor agonist class.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Oral insulin 338 (I338) is a long-acting, basal insulin analogue formulated in a tablet with the absorption-enhancer sodium caprate. We investigated the efficacy and safety of I338 versus subcutaneous insulin glargine (IGlar) in patients with type 2 diabetes.

   METHODS: This was a phase 2, 8-week, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled, parallel trial completed at two research institutes in Germany. Insulin-naive adult patients with type 2 diabetes, inadequately controlled on metformin monotherapy or combined with other oral antidiabetic drugs (HbA1c 7.0-10.0%; BMI 25.0-40.0 kg/m2), were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive once-daily I338 plus subcutaneous placebo (I338 group) or once-daily IGlar plus oral placebo (IGlar group). Randomisation occurred by interactive web response system stratified by baseline treatment with oral antidiabetic drugs. Patients and investigators were masked to treatment assignment. Weekly insulin dose titration aimed to achieve a self-measured fasting plasma glucose (FPG) concentration of 4.4-7.0 mmol/L. The recommended daily starting doses were 2700 nmol I338 or 10 U IGlar, and maximum allowed doses throughout the trial were 16 200 nmol I338 or 60 U IGlar. The primary endpoint was treatment difference in FPG concentration at 8 weeks for all randomly assigned patients receiving at least one dose of trial product (ie, the full analysis set). The trial has been completed and is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02470039.

   FINDINGS: Between June 1, 2015, and Oct 19, 2015, 82 patients were screened for eligibility and 50 patients were randomly assigned to the I338 group (n=25) or the IGlar group (n=25). Mean FPG concentration at baseline was 9.7 (SD 2.8) in the I338 group and 9.1 (1.7) in the IGlar group. Least square mean FPG concentration at 8 weeks was 7.1 mmol/L (95% CI 6.4-7.8) in the I338 group and 6.8 mmol/L (6.5-7.1) in the IGlar group, with no significant treatment difference (0.3 mmol/L [-0.5 to 1.1]; p=0.46). I338 and IGlar were well tolerated by patients. Adverse events were reported in 15 (60%) patients in the I338 group and 17 (68%) patients in the IGlar group. The most common adverse events were diarrhoea (three [12%] patients in each group) and nasopharyngitis (five [20%] in the I338 group and two [8%] in the IGlar group). Most adverse events were graded mild (47 of 68 events), and no severe adverse events were reported. One patient in the IGlar group had a treatment-emergent serious adverse event (urogenital haemorrhage of moderate intensity, assessed by the investigator as unlikely to be related to treatment; the patient recovered). Incidence of hypoglycaemia was low in both groups (n=7 events in the I338 group; n=11 in the IGlar group), with no severe episodes.

   INTERPRETATION: I338 can safely improve glycaemic control in insulin-naive patients with type 2 diabetes with no evidence of a difference compared with insulin glargine, a widely used subcutaneously administered basal insulin. Further development of this particular oral insulin project was discontinued because I338 doses were high and, therefore, production of the required quantities of I338 for wide public use was deemed not commercially viable. Improvement of technologies involved in the product's development is the focus of ongoing research.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: The use of metformin after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) has been associated with reduced mortality in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, it is not known if it is acutely cardioprotective in patients taking metformin at the time of AMI. We compared patient outcomes according to metformin status at the time of admission for fatal and non-fatal AMI in a large cohort of patients in England.

   METHODS: This study used linked data from primary care, hospital admissions and death registry from 4.7 million inhabitants in England, as part of the CALIBER resource. The primary endpoint was a composite of acute myocardial infarction requiring hospitalisation, stroke and cardiovascular death. The secondary endpoints were heart failure (HF) hospitalisation and all-cause mortality.

   RESULTS: 4,030 patients with T2DM and incident AMI recorded between January 1998 and October 2010 were included. At AMI admission, 63.9% of patients were receiving metformin and 36.1% another oral hypoglycaemic drug. Median follow-up was 343 (IQR: 1-1436) days. Adjusted analyses showed an increased hazard of the composite endpoint in metformin users compared to non-users (HR 1.09 [1.01-1.19]), but not of the secondary endpoints. The higher risk of the composite endpoint in metformin users was only observed in people taking metformin at AMI admission, whereas metformin use post-AMI was associated with a reduction in risk of all-cause mortality (0.76 [0.62-0.93], P = 0.009).

   CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that metformin use at the time of first AMI is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and death in patients with T2DM, while its use post-AMI might be beneficial. Further investigation in well-designed randomised controlled trials is indicated, especially in view of emerging evidence of cardioprotection from sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To explore the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of once-weekly efpeglenatide, a long-acting glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA), in early type 2 diabetes (T2D) (drug naive or on metformin monotherapy).

   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: EXCEED 203 was a 12-week, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group, dose-ranging study of efpeglenatide once weekly referenced to open-label liraglutide 1.8 mg (exploratory analysis). Participants , ~90% on metformin monotherapy, were randomized to one of five efpeglenatide doses (0.3, 1, 2, 3, or 4 mg q.w.; n = 181), placebo (n = 37), or liraglutide (<=1.8 mg daily; n = 36). The primary efficacy end point was change in HbA1c from baseline to week 13.

   RESULTS: From a baseline HbA1c of 7.7-8.0% (61.0-63.9 mmol/mol), all efpeglenatide doses >=1 mg significantly reduced HbA1c versus placebo (placebo-adjusted least squares [LS] mean changes 0.6-1.2%, P < 0.05 for all) to a final HbA1c of 6.3-6.8% (45.4-50.6 mmol/mol); masked efpeglenatide 4 mg was noninferior to open-label liraglutide. Greater proportions treated with efpeglenatide >=1 mg than placebo achieved HbA1c <7% (61-72% vs. 24%, P < 0.05 for all), and greater reductions in body weight were observed with efpeglenatide 3 and 4 mg versus placebo (placebo-adjusted LS mean differences -1.4 and -2.0 kg, respectively, P < 0.05 for both). Rates of nausea and vomiting were consistent with other GLP-1 RAs and rapidly subsided after the initial 2 weeks. No neutralizing antibodies were detected with efpeglenatide.

   CONCLUSIONS: Efpeglenatide once weekly led to significant reductions in HbA1c and weight, with a safety profile consistent with the GLP-1 RA class in patients with early T2D mostly on metformin monotherapy. Copyright © 2019 by the American Diabetes Association.

Abstract
  The economic issues related to medical treatments in youth with type 2 diabetes (T2D) are rarely reported and thus not fully understood. The Treatment Options for type 2 Diabetes in Adolescents and Youth clinical trial of youth recently diagnosed with T2D collected healthcare and related cost information from the largest cohort studied to date. Costs related to medical treatments and expenses faced by caregivers were identified over a 2-year period from 496 participants. Data were collected by surveys and diaries to document frequency of use of diabetes care (excluding study laboratory tests), non-diabetes care services and treatments, caregiver time, and expenses related to exercise and dietary activities recommended for patients. Economic costs were derived by applying national cost values to the reported utilization frequency data. Annual medical costs in the first year varied by the treatment group, averaging $1798 in those assigned to metformin alone (M), $2971 to combination drug therapy with metformin + rosiglitazone (M + R), and $2092 to metformin + an intensive lifestyle and behavior change program (M + L). Differences were primarily due to costs related to combination drug therapy. Adult caregiver support costs were higher for participants in the lifestyle program, which was delivered in weekly sessions in the first 6 months. Expenses for purchases to enhance diet and exercise change did not vary by treatment assignment. In year 2, medication costs increased in M and M + L due to the initiation of insulin in subjects who failed to maintain glycemic control on the assigned treatment. Data are reported for use by researchers and those providing healthcare to this vulnerable patient population. Copyright © 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVES: Maintaining glycemic control limits costly health risks in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), but accomplishing this may require individualized strategies. Generic medications (eg, sulfonylureas [SU], insulin) are common in T2D management due to their efficacy and costs; however, relatively new drug classes (eg, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 [DPP-4] inhibitors, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 [SGLT2] inhibitors) have demonstrated clinical benefits in combination therapy. The objective of this study was to evaluate the long-term cost-effectiveness of a strategy involving branded combination therapy with DPP-4 inhibitors and SGLT2 inhibitors (pathway 1) compared with a generic alternative with SU and insulin (pathway 2) on a background of metformin.

   STUDY DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis using the validated IQVIA CORE Diabetes Model from the US payer perspective.

   METHODS: Cost-effectiveness analysis. Lifetime clinical and economic outcomes (discounted 3%/year) were modeled for a T2D cohort failing to achieve glycemic goal on metformin monotherapy. Patient baseline data and treatment effects reflect results of clinical trials. Direct medical cost inputs are from multiple published sources. Scenario analyses on key intervention effects and assumptions tested robustness of results.

   RESULTS: Pathway 1 had higher direct medical costs compared with pathway 2, yet also increased total quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) by 0.24. Increased costs were partially offset by a reduction in diabetes-related complications and delayed insulin initiation. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for pathway 1 is favorable at $64,784/QALY. Scenario analyses showed limited impact; nearly all ICERs were less than $100,000/QALY.

   CONCLUSIONS: In the United States, sequential addition of SGLT2 inhibitors to DPP-4 inhibitors may be considered cost-effective compared with traditional treatment with generic medications for patients who fail to achieve glycemic goal on metformin.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: No randomized controlled trials evaluating metformin therapy efficacy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and acute coronary syndrome (ACS) have been reported. We aimed to examine the mortality benefit of metformin therapy in patients with type 2 DM and ACS, compared with non-metformin anti-diabetes agents users.

   METHODS: Data were extracted from the prospective nationwide ACS-DM Taiwan Society of Cardiology registry. Propensity score (PS) matching on baseline characteristics and treatment measures was performed for metformin versus non-metformin users. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to compare mortality outcomes among the PS-matched cohort as the primary analysis. The Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for all pre-determined covariates and quintiles of the PS among the overall population were performed as the secondary analyses.

   RESULTS: Of 1157 patients with type 2 DM and ACS receiving anti-diabetes agents, 78 patients (6.7%) died over the 2-year follow-up period. After PS matching, 318 metformin users were matched with 318 non-metformin users. Metformin users had a lower all-cause mortality rate (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.50, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.26-0.95) in the primary analysis. The survival benefit of metformin therapy was consistent in the secondary analyses (aHR 0.30, 95% CI 0.17-0.54 while adjusting for all pre-determined covariates, and aHR 0.34, 95% CI 0.19-0.59 while adjusting for quintiles of the PS).

   CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with type 2 DM and ACS, metformin was associated with lower all-cause mortality. However, a detrimental effect of any of the comparators could not be excluded. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The treatment of type 2 diabetes in older adults requires special considerations including avoidance of hypoglycemia, yet variation in diabetes treatment with aging is not well understood. In this study, we compared nationally representative diabetes treatment patterns and trends between older adults (>=65 y) and younger adults (30-64 y).

   DESIGN: Repeated cross-sectional physician surveys from 2006 to 2015.

   SETTING: The National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, an annual probability sample of visits to office-based US physicians.

   PARTICIPANTS: Adults with type 2 diabetes using one or more diabetes medications.

   MEASUREMENTS: Proportions of visits in which patients treated with each diabetes medication class were compared between older and younger adults in 2-year intervals.

   RESULTS: From 2006 to 2015, the average number of yearly visits for older and younger adults was 25.4 million and 24.2 million, respectively. In 2014-2015, visits for older compared with younger adults involved less use of metformin (56.0% vs 70.0%; p < .001) and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (2.9% vs 6.2%; p = .004), and more use of long-acting insulin (30.2% vs 22.4%; p = .017); other classes were used similarly. During the study period, long-acting insulin use increased markedly in older adults, particularly between 2010 and 2015 where it rose from 12.5% to 30.2% of visits (P-trend <.001). In younger adult visits, long-acting insulin use increased modestly (17.2% to 22.4%) and at a slower rate compared with older adult visits (p < .001).

   CONCLUSION: The ambulatory treatment of type 2 diabetes differs between older and younger adults, with the treatment of older adults characterized by low use of newer diabetes medications and a greater and rapidly increasing use of long-acting insulin. These findings call for further research clarifying the comparative effectiveness and safety of newer diabetes medications and long-acting insulin to optimize diabetes care for older patients.

Abstract
  PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The number of bariatric surgeries for patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes continues to grow. Clinicians are challenged to choose therapies that reach glycemic targets without inducing adverse effects in post-bariatric patients without published guidelines. This review evaluates data supporting the best strategies for diabetes management in patients undergoing bariatric surgery.

   RECENT FINDINGS: Though few clinical trials have evaluated the safety and effectiveness of different glucose-lowering therapies following bariatric surgery, remission of diabetes or reduced medications is an established benefit of bariatric surgery. Adverse events including diabetic ketoacidosis in post-bariatric patients on sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors or inadequate insulin have been reported in patient's with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Metformin, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibitors, insulin, and sulfonylureas have been used successfully in the perioperative period for other surgeries and guidelines recommend adjusting the doses of these medications especially in the perioperative period. Clinicians should favor weight-neutral or weight-loss promoting therapies in post-bariatric surgery patients such as medical nutrition therapy, metformin, GLP-1 agonists, SGLT2 inhibitors, and DPP-4 inhibitors.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most lethal cancers. Nutrition- and life style-associated risk factors are increasingly prevalent. Metformin, the mainstay of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)-treatment, reduces the risk of hepatocarcinogenesis. However, its influence on the prognosis of patients with HCC has not been investigated on a large scale, yet.

   METHODS: Five thousand and ninety-three patients treated for HCC between 2000 and 2016 at three referral centres were included in this retrospective multicentre study. The aim of this study was to assess whether treatment with metformin for T2DM is associated with a prolonged overall survival (OS) in patients diagnosed with HCC.

   RESULTS: Among 5093 patients with HCC, 1917 patients (37.6%) were diagnosed with T2DM, of which 338 (17.6%) received treatment with metformin. Compared to diabetic patients not treated with metformin, patients on metformin had a significantly better hepatic function (Child-Pugh-Score A: 69.2% vs 47.4%, P < 0.001) and underwent significantly more often tumour resection (22.1% vs 16.5%, P = 0.024). Patients on metformin had a significantly longer median OS (mOS) compared to diabetic patients not treated with metformin (22 vs 15 months, P = 0.019). The prolongation of survival was most significant in patients treated with surgery. Using a propensity score match (PSM), patients were adjusted for hepatic function and initial therapy. In the matched cohorts, mOS remained significantly longer in metformin-treated patients (22 vs 16 months, P = 0.021). Co-treatment of metformin and sorafenib was associated with a survival disadvantage.

   CONCLUSION: Treatment with metformin was associated with an improved survival in patients with T2DM and HCC. This effect was most pronounced in patients at potentially curative tumour stages. Copyright © 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Abstract
  Natriuretic peptides are cardiac-derived hormones that enhance insulin sensitivity and reduce fat accumulation. Low natriuretic peptide levels are associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2); a condition with variable prevalence across racial/ethnic groups. Few studies have examined whether circulating natriuretic peptide levels and their response to preventive interventions for DM2 differ by race/ethnicity. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) is a clinical trial (July 31, 1996- July 31, 2001) that randomized participants to preventive interventions for DM2. Using stored serum samples, we examined N-terminus pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels in 3,220 individuals (56% white; 19% African-American; 15% Hispanic; 5% American-Indian; 5% Asian). The influence of race/ethnicity on NT-proBNP concentrations at baseline and after two years of treatment with placebo, lifestyle, or metformin was examined with multivariable-adjusted regression. At baseline, NT-proBNP differed significantly by race (P < .001), with the lowest values in African-American individuals. Hispanic individuals also had lower baseline NT-proBNP levels compared with whites (P< .001), while NT-proBNP levels were similar between white, American-Indian, and Asian individuals. At two years of follow-up, NT-proBNP levels decreased in African-Americans in each of the DPP study arms, whereas they were stable or increased in the other racial/ethnic groups. In the DPP, African-American individuals had lower circulating NT-proBNP levels compared with individuals in other racial/ethnic groups at baseline and after two years of preventive interventions. Further studies should examine the cardio-metabolic implications of lower natriuretic peptide levels in African-Americans. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00004992.

Abstract
  Metformin is a widely prescribed antidiabetic agent, whereas Scutellaria baicalensis (SB) is a commonly used medicinal herb for treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Gut microbiota is involved in pathophysiology of metabolic diseases including T2D, and intestinal microbiota may be one of the important therapeutic targets for the ailment. This study was conducted to investigate the effects of SB combined with metformin on treatment of T2D while evaluating changes in the gut microbiota composition. Patients with T2D were randomized into control and treatment groups. Subjects who had already been prescribed metformin were allotted to additional SB (3.52 g/day) group or placebo group. The initial treatment session was 8 wk, and after washout period for 4 wk they were crossed over to the opposite treatment for another 8 wk. The influence of SB and placebo on the intestinal microbiota was analyzed by MiSeq system based on 16S rRNA gene. Glucose tolerance was lower in the SB group than the placebo group. Similarly, the relative RNA expression of TNF-alpha was significantly reduced after SB treatment. SB treatment influenced the gut microbiota, especially Lactobacillus and Akkermansia, which showed remarkable increases after SB treatment. Some subjects showed high liver enzyme levels after SB treatment, and their microbiota composition at baseline differed with subjects whose liver enzymes were not affected. We also predicted that selenocompound metabolism was increased and naphthalene degradation was decreased after SB treatment. These results suggest that SB with metformin treatment may improve the glucose tolerance and inflammation and influence the gut microbiota community in T2D.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: Outcomes in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) could be optimized by identifying which treatments are likely to produce the greatest improvements in glycemic control for each patient.

   OBJECTIVES: We aimed to identify patient characteristics associated with achieving and maintaining a target glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) of <= 7% using machine learning methodology to analyze clinical trial data on combination therapy for T2DM. By applying a new machine learning methodology to an existing clinical dataset, the practical application of this approach was evaluated and the potential utility of this new approach to clinical decision making was assessed.

   METHODS: Data were pooled from two phase III, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group studies of empagliflozin/linagliptin single-pill combination therapy versus each monotherapy in patients who were treatment-naive or receiving background metformin. Descriptive analysis was used to assess univariate associations between HbA1c target categories and each baseline characteristic. After the descriptive analysis results, a machine learning analysis was performed (classification tree and random forest methods) to estimate and predict target categories based on patient characteristics at baseline, without a priori selection.

   RESULTS: In the descriptive analysis, lower mean baseline HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) were both associated with achieving and maintaining the HbA1c target. The machine learning analysis also identified HbA1c and FPG as the strongest predictors of attaining glycemic control. In contrast, covariates including body weight, waist circumference, blood pressure, or other variables did not contribute to the outcome.

   CONCLUSIONS: Using both traditional and novel data analysis methodologies, this study identified baseline glycemic status as the strongest predictor of target glycemic control attainment. Machine learning algorithms provide an hypothesis-free, unbiased methodology, which can greatly enhance the search for predictors of therapeutic success in T2DM. The approach used in the present analysis provides an example of how a machine learning algorithm can be applied to a clinical dataset and used to develop predictions that can facilitate clinical decision making.
Other Abstract
  plain-language-summary What did this study look at? This study looked at whether a computer program could predict which people with type 2 diabetes would respond best to a particular treatment. The study treatment was a single-pill combination of two medicines, empagliflozin [em-PAH-gli-FLOW-zin] and linagliptin [LYNN-nah-GLIP-tin]. It is used to lower blood sugar (blood glucose) in people with type 2 diabetes. The researchers used machine learning to analyze data from people who received this treatment. Machine learning uses computer models to find patterns in information. The results helped to predict which people might respond best to the treatment. Who took part in this study? The researchers looked at results collected from two earlier studies of the treatment. 1363 people took part. Approximately half of them were male. Their average age was 55 years. Approximately half of them had not received any previous diabetes treatment, and approximately half (50.3%) had received metformin treatment for diabetes. What did the study show? The researchers found that two blood tests commonly used in clinical practice helped them predict who would have the best response to treatment. These tests were HbA1c levels (a measure of long-term blood glucose control), and their fasting plasma glucose (blood glucose levels when they had not eaten for 10-16 h). This study suggests that machine learning could be a useful tool to help doctors decide which treatments will work best for individuals with type 2 diabetes. Language: English

Abstract
  CONTEXT: The combination of two beneficial antidiabetes interventions, regular exercise and pharmaceuticals, is intuitively appealing. However, metformin, the most commonly prescribed diabetes medication, attenuates the favorable physiological adaptations to exercise; in turn, exercise may impede the action of metformin.

   OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine the influence of an alternative diabetes treatment, sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibition, on the response to endurance exercise training.

   DESIGN, PARTICIPANTS, AND INTERVENTION: In a randomized, double-blind, repeated measures parallel design, 30 sedentary overweight and obese men and women were assigned to 12 weeks of supervised endurance exercise training, with daily ingestion of either a placebo or SGLT2 inhibitor (dapagliflozin: <=10 mg/day).

   OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Endurance exercise training favorably modified body mass, body composition (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry), peak oxygen uptake (graded exercise with indirect calorimetry), responses to standardized submaximal exercise (indirect calorimetry, heart rate, and blood lactate), and skeletal muscle (vastus lateralis) citrate synthase activity (main effects of exercise training, all P < 0.05); SGLT2 inhibition did not influence any of these physiological adaptations (exercise training x treatment interaction, all P > 0.05). However, after endurance exercise training, fasting blood glucose was greater with SGLT2 inhibition, and increased insulin sensitivity (oral glucose tolerance test/Matsuda index) was abrogated with SGLT2 inhibition (exercise training x treatment interaction, P < 0.01).

   CONCLUSION: The efficacy of combining two beneficial antidiabetes interventions, regular endurance exercise and SGLT2 inhibition, was not supported. SGLT2 inhibition blunted endurance exercise training-induced improvements in insulin sensitivity, independent of effects on aerobic fitness or body composition. Copyright © 2019 Endocrine Society.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: The projected rise in the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) could develop into a substantial health problem worldwide. Whether metformin can prevent or delay T2DM and its complications in people with increased risk of developing T2DM is unknown.

   OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of metformin for the prevention or delay of T2DM and its associated complications in persons at increased risk for the T2DM.

   SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Scopus, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and the reference lists of systematic reviews, articles and health technology assessment reports. We asked investigators of the included trials for information about additional trials. The date of the last search of all databases was March 2019.

   SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a duration of one year or more comparing metformin with any pharmacological glucose-lowering intervention, behaviour-changing intervention, placebo or standard care in people with impaired glucose tolerance, impaired fasting glucose, moderately elevated glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) or combinations of these.

   DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors read all abstracts and full-text articles and records, assessed risk of bias and extracted outcome data independently. We used a random-effects model to perform meta-analysis and calculated risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes, using 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for effect estimates. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE.

   MAIN RESULTS: We included 20 RCTs randomising 6774 participants. One trial contributed 48% of all participants. The duration of intervention in the trials varied from one to five years. We judged none of the trials to be at low risk of bias in all 'Risk of bias' domains. Our main outcome measures were all-cause mortality, incidence of T2DM, serious adverse events (SAEs), cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction or stroke, health-related quality of life and socioeconomic effects. The following comparisons mostly reported only a fraction of our main outcome set. Fifteen RCTs compared metformin with diet and exercise with or without placebo: all-cause mortality was 7/1353 versus 7/1480 (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.41 to 3.01; P = 0.83; 2833 participants, 5 trials; very low-quality evidence); incidence of T2DM was 324/1751 versus 529/1881 participants (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.65; P < 0.001; 3632 participants, 12 trials; moderate-quality evidence); the reporting of SAEs was insufficient and diverse and meta-analysis could not be performed (reported numbers were 4/118 versus 2/191; 309 participants; 4 trials; very low-quality evidence); cardiovascular mortality was 1/1073 versus 4/1082 (2416 participants; 2 trials; very low-quality evidence). One trial reported no clear difference in health-related quality of life after 3.2 years of follow-up (very low-quality evidence). Two trials estimated the direct medical costs (DMC) per participant for metformin varying from $220 to $1177 versus $61 to $184 in the comparator group (2416 participants; 2 trials; low-quality evidence). Eight RCTs compared metformin with intensive diet and exercise: all-cause mortality was 7/1278 versus 4/1272 (RR 1.61, 95% CI 0.50 to 5.23; P = 0.43; 2550 participants, 4 trials; very low-quality evidence); incidence of T2DM was 304/1455 versus 251/1505 (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.37; P = 0.42; 2960 participants, 7 trials; moderate-quality evidence); the reporting of SAEs was sparse and meta-analysis could not be performed (one trial reported 1/44 in the metformin group versus 0/36 in the intensive exercise and diet group with SAEs). One trial reported that 1/1073 participants in the metformin group compared with 2/1079 participants in the comparator group died from cardiovascular causes. One trial reported that no participant died due to cardiovascular causes (very low-quality evidence). Two trials estimated the DMC per participant for metformin varying from $220 to $1177 versus $225 to $3628 in the comparator group (2400 participants; 2 trials; very low-quality evidence). Three RCTs compared metformin with acarbose: all-cause mortality was 1/44 versus 0/45 (89 participants; 1 trial; very low-quality evidence); incidence of T2DM was 12/147 versus 7/148 (RR 1.72, 95% CI 0.72 to 4.14; P = 0.22; 295 participants; 3 trials; low-quality evidence); SAEs were 1/51 versus 2/50 (101 participants; 1 trial; very low-quality evidence). Three RCTs compared metformin with thiazolidinediones: incidence of T2DM was 9/161 versus 9/159 (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.41 to 2.40; P = 0.98; 320 participants; 3 trials; low-quality evidence). SAEs were 3/45 versus 0/41 (86 participants; 1 trial; very low-quality evidence). Three RCTs compared metformin plus intensive diet and exercise with identical intensive diet and exercise: all-cause mortality was 1/121 versus 1/120 participants (450 participants; 2 trials; very low-quality evidence); incidence of T2DM was 48/166 versus 53/166 (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.10 to 2.92; P = 0.49; 332 participants; 2 trials; very low-quality evidence). One trial estimated the DMC of metformin plus intensive diet and exercise to be $270 per participant compared with $225 in the comparator group (94 participants; 1 trial; very-low quality evidence). One trial in 45 participants compared metformin with a sulphonylurea. The trial reported no patient-important outcomes. For all comparisons there were no data on non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke or microvascular complications. We identified 11 ongoing trials which potentially could provide data of interest for this review. These trials will add a total of 17,853 participants in future updates of this review.

   AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Metformin compared with placebo or diet and exercise reduced or delayed the risk of T2DM in people at increased risk for the development of T2DM (moderate-quality evidence). However, metformin compared to intensive diet and exercise did not reduce or delay the risk of T2DM (moderate-quality evidence). Likewise, the combination of metformin and intensive diet and exercise compared to intensive diet and exercise only neither showed an advantage or disadvantage regarding the development of T2DM (very low-quality evidence). Data on patient-important outcomes such as mortality, macrovascular and microvascular diabetic complications and health-related quality of life were sparse or missing.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Chronic lower respiratory diseases (CLRD) increase the risk of type 2 diabetes, which in turn may worsen lung function. Metformin, a common antidiabetic with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, may improve respiratory outcomes. Therefore, we examined the association of metformin use with the risk of mortality from CLRD.

   METHODS: We analysed data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey during 1988-1994 and 1999-2010 for participants aged 40 years or older who had diabetes and were followed up for mortality through 2011. Information on prescription medicine was collected at baseline and CLRD-related mortality during follow-up was defined using the 10th Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). Cox proportional hazards modelling was used to determine the mortality hazard ratio (HR) associated with metformin use, adjusting for relevant covariates.

   RESULTS: A total of 5266 participants with a median follow-up of 6.1 years were included. The prevalence of metformin use was 31.9% and 1869 participants died during follow-up, including 72 of CLRD. In the adjusted Cox proportional regression analysis, metformin was associated with a decreased risk of CLRD mortality in the overall population (HR: 0.39, 95% CI: 0.15-0.99) and among participants with baseline CLRD (HR: 0.30, 95% CI: 0.10-0.93), after adjusting for age, gender, race/ethnicity, cigarette smoking, body mass index, current asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), insulin and other diabetic medications, and glycohaemoglobin level. We found no association between other antidiabetic medications and CLRD mortality.

   CONCLUSION: In this sample representative of the U.S. population, metformin was associated with lower CLRD mortality in adults with diabetes. Copyright © 2019 Asian Pacific Society of Respirology.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated whether an oral combination of a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor and a dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor achieved glycemic control similar to basal insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes, poorly controlled with metformin, without increasing hypoglycemia or body weight.

   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In a multinational, open-label, randomized, phase 3 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov reg. no. NCT02551874), adults with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin, with or without sulfonylurea, were randomized (1:1) to receive dapagliflozin (DAPA) plus saxagliptin (SAXA) or titrated insulin glargine (INS). The primary end point was change in glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) from baseline to week 24. DAPA + SAXA treatment was tested for noninferiority versus INS.

   RESULTS: The efficacy data set included 643 patients (mean +/- SD HbA1c, 9.1 +/- 1.0% [75 +/- 11 mmol/mol]). At week 24, DAPA + SAXA treatment versus INS resulted in noninferior reductions in HbA1c (adjusted mean +/- SE change, -1.7 +/- 0.1% vs. -1.5 +/- 0.1% [18.3 +/- 0.7 mmol/mol vs. 16.8 +/- 0.7 mmol/mol]; P = 0.118), significantly different body weight change (between-group difference, -3.64 kg [95% CI -4.20 to -3.09]; P < 0.001), fewer patients with confirmed hypoglycemia (21.3% vs. 38.4%, P < 0.001), more patients achieving HbA1c <7.0% (53 mmol/mol) without hypoglycemia (20.9% vs. 13.1%, P = 0.008), and a similar proportion of patients achieving HbA1c <7.0% (33.2% vs. 33.5%, P = 0.924). Mean reductions in 24-h glucose measurements from baseline to week 2 were greater with DAPA + SAXA than with INS (P < 0.0001). No patients in the DAPA + SAXA group and three patients (0.9%) in the INS group experienced severe hypoglycemia.

   CONCLUSIONS: Adding DAPA + SAXA to insulin-naive patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes achieved similar glycemic control, a lower risk of hypoglycemia, and a clinically relevant body weight difference compared with basal INS. Copyright © 2019 by the American Diabetes Association.

Abstract
  Objectives: To evaluate the risk of cancers of digestive system with incretin-based therapies among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

   Research design and methods: Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library and ClinicalTrials.gov databases were searched for randomized controlled clinical trials that compared incretin-based drugs with placebo or other antidiabetic drugs. Paired reviewers independently screened citations, extracted data and assessed risk of bias of included studies. Network meta-analysis was performed, followed by subgroup analysis. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation system was used to assess the quality of evidence.

   Results: A total of 84 studies (n=101 595) involving cancers of digestive system were identified (a median follow-up of 30 weeks). The risk of cancers of digestive system with incretin-based therapies was comparable with insulin (OR: 0.86, 95% CI 0.27 to 2.69), metformin (OR: 0.32, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.38), sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (OR: 5.26, 95% CI 0.58 to 47.41), sulfonylureas (OR: 1.27, 95% CI 0.68 to 2.39), thiazolidinediones (OR: 0.42, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.42), alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (OR: 2.98, 95% CI 0.12 to 73.80), and placebo (OR: 0.87, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.05). The results of subgroup analysis based on the type of digestive system cancers indicated that incretin-based therapies did not increase the risk of gastrointestinal cancers, respectively. The results of subgroup analysis based on age, duration, mean HbA1c, trial duration, and sample size did not indicate the risk of digestive system cancers.

   Conclusions: Moderate to high Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation evidence suggests that incretin-based therapies were not associated with an increased risk of cancer of digestive system in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: We evaluated the efficacy and safety of acarbose add-on therapy in Korean patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who are inadequately controlled with metformin and sitagliptin.

   METHODS: A total of 165 subjects were randomized to metformin and sitagliptin (Met+Sita, n=65), metformin, sitagliptin, and acarbose (Met+Sita+Acarb, n=66) and sitagliptin and acarbose (Sita+Acarb, exploratory assessment, n=34) therapy in five institutions in Korea. After 16 weeks of acarbose add-on or metformin-switch therapy, a triple combination therapy was maintained from week 16 to 24.

   RESULTS: The add-on of acarbose (Met+Sita+Acarb group) demonstrated a 0.44%+/-0.08% (P<0.001 vs. baseline) decrease in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) at week 16, while changes in HbA1c were insignificant in the Met+Sita group (-0.09%+/-0.10%, P=0.113). After 8 weeks of triple combination therapy, HbA1c levels were comparable between Met+Sita and Met+Sita+Acarb group (7.66%+/-0.13% vs. 7.47%+/-0.12%, P=0.321). Acarbose add-on therapy demonstrated suppressed glucagon secretion (area under the curve of glucagon, 4,726.17+/-415.80 ng.min/L vs. 3,314.38+/-191.63 ng.min/L, P=0.004) in the absence of excess insulin secretion during the meal tolerance tests at week 16 versus baseline. The incidence of adverse or serious adverse events was similar between two groups.

   CONCLUSION: In conclusion, a 16-week acarbose add-on therapy to metformin and sitagliptin, effectively lowered HbA1c without significant adverse events. Acarbose might be a good choice as a third-line therapy in addition to metformin and sitagliptin in Korean subjects with T2DM who have predominant postprandial hyperglycemia and a high carbohydrate intake.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Combination of metformin to reduce the fasting plasma glucose level and an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor to decrease the postprandial glucose level is expected to generate a complementary effect. We compared the efficacy and safety of a fixed-dose combination of voglibose plus metformin (vogmet) with metformin monotherapy in drug-naive newly-diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus.

   METHODS: A total of 187 eligible patients aged 20 to 70 years, with a glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level of 7.0% to 11.0%, were randomized into either vogmet or metformin treatments for 24 weeks. A change in the HbA1c level from baseline was measured at week 24.

   RESULTS: The reduction in the levels of HbA1c was -1.62%+/-0.07% in the vogmet group and -1.31%+/-0.07% in the metformin group (P=0.003), and significantly more vogmet-treated patients achieved the target HbA1c levels of <6.5% (P=0.002) or <7% (P=0.039). Glycemic variability was also significantly improved with vogmet treatment, estimated by M-values (P=0.004). Gastrointestinal adverse events and hypoglycemia (%) were numerically lower in the vogmet-treated group. Moreover, a significant weight loss was observed with vogmet treatment compared with metformin (-1.63 kg vs. -0.86 kg, P=0.039).

   CONCLUSION: Vogmet is a safe antihyperglycemic agent that controls blood glucose level effectively, yields weight loss, and is superior to metformin in terms of various key glycemic parameters without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia. Copyright © 2019 Korean Diabetes Association.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and poor glycemic control receiving metformin (MET), glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) are recommended as the adjunctive therapy. However, there are only a few studies involving the comparative effects of exenatide twice a day (EXBID) and exenatide once weekly (EXQW) on HOMA-beta. This meta assessed the comparative effects of EXQW and EXBID on HOMA-beta among T2DM patients.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Embase databases were searched to collect randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Network meta-analysis was performed, and network diagrams were constructed to evaluate the effects. The primary outcome is HOMA-beta, and the secondary outcomes are fasting blood glycose (FBG), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and weight loss.

   RESULTS: A total of 8 studies with 3506 subjects were included. Compared with other antidiabetic agents, EXQW has a greater improvement in HOMA-beta than EXBID (weight mean difference (WMD) = -0.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) [-0.64, -0.28], P = 0.001). The effect of EXQW on HbA1c is superior to that of sitagliptin (SITA) (WMD = 0.51, 95% CI [0.03, 0.99], P = 0.037). The significant reduction of weight was detected for EXBID in comparison with EXQW (WMD = -0.73, 95% CI [-1.13, -0.33], P = 0.001), and no significant difference was found between EXQW and MET.

   CONCLUSIONS: EXQW shows a greater improvement in HOMA-beta than EXBID. Moreover, the efficacy of EXQW on glycemic control is similar to other antidiabetic agents including EXBID. It is an advisable treatment for diabetic patients to improve HOMA-beta and has an advantage of fewer number of injections compared with EXBID, to increase patients' adherence and quality of life.

Abstract
  Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is one of the most common chronic diseases. Patients are generally advised lifestyle changes with antihyperglycemic agents prescribed. The major drawback of prescribing antihyperglycemic agents is the risk of hypoglycemia which subsequently impacts on health-related quality of life (HRQoL). This study is aimed at examining association between previous history of hypoglycemia and HRQoL. The study was a multicenter cross-sectional study, conducted from February 2013 to March 2015 at 5 tertiary care hospitals in Thailand (Srinagarind, Phramongkutklao, Ramathibodi, King Chulalongkorn Memorial, and Siriraj hospitals). The study population were males or females diagnosed with type 2 DM according to ADA criteria, 30 years of age or older, who had been treated with sulfonylurea (SU) monotherapy or SU and metformin combination for at least 6 months. Prespecified medical factors were extracted from medical records 12 months prior to patients' enrolment. The experience of hypoglycemia questionnaire was used to collect and measure severity of hypoglycemia experienced during the previous 6 months. HRQoL was assessed using the 3-level version of EuroQol-5-dimension (EQ-5D-3L) and visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS) questionnaires. Of 659 eligible patients surveyed, 202 patients (30.65%) had experienced symptoms of hypoglycemia. HRQoL was significantly lower among patients reporting at least one of hypoglycemic symptoms, measured by EQ-VAS scores (mean +/- SD; 73.66 +/- 13.18, 73.56 +/- 15.10, or 68.93 +/- 14.76 vs. 77.01 +/- 13.02, one-way ANOVA; p = 0.006) and EQ-5D-3L index scores (0.62 +/- 0.47, 0.68 +/- 0.38, or 0.58 +/- 0.51 vs. 0.79 +/- 0.31, one-way ANOVA; p < 0.001) for mild, moderate, or severe/very severe hypoglycemic patients compared with patients without hypoglycemic symptoms. After adjusting for confounding factors in a multiple linear regression model, patients with hypoglycemic symptoms either mild, moderate, or severe/very severe demonstrated significantly higher impairment for EQ-VAS and EQ-5D indexes than those who did not experience hypoglycemic symptoms. In conclusion, our study showed decreased HRQoL determined by EQ-5D and EQ-VAS in patients reporting symptoms of hypoglycemia compared with patients not reporting hypoglycemic symptoms, relative to severity of hypoglycemia.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: In the Treatment Options for Type 2 Diabetes in Adolescents and Youth (TODAY) study, metformin plus rosiglitazone (M + R) maintained glycemic control better than metformin alone (M) or metformin plus lifestyle (M + L) in youth with type 2 diabetes (T2D). We hypothesized that changes in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) would explain the differential treatment effects on glycemia.

   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In 626 youth ages 11-17 years with T2D duration <2 years, VAT and SAT were estimated by DXA at baseline and at 6 and 24 months. Changes from baseline were analyzed in linear mixed models.

   RESULTS: Baseline mean age was 13.9 years, 66.4% were female, 72.2% were Hispanic/non-Hispanic black, and 20.3% were non-Hispanic white (NHW). Mean BMI was 33.7 kg/m2. VAT increased more in M + R (13.1%) than M + L (3.9%, P = 0.0006) or M (6.5%, P = 0.0146). SAT also increased more in M + R (13.3%) than in M + L (5.4%, P < 0.0001) or M (6.4%, P = 0.0005), indicating no significant fat redistribution in M + R. In NHWs, VAT increased more in M + R than M (P = 0.0192) and M + L (P = 0.0482) but did not explain the race-ethnicity differences in treatment effects on glycemic control among treatment groups. VAT and SAT increases correlated with higher HbA1c, lower insulin sensitivity, and lower oral disposition index (all P < 0.05), but associations did not differ by treatment group.

   CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to the existing reports in adults with T2D, in TODAY, M + R resulted in the most VAT accumulation compared with M + L or M. Differential effects on depot-specific indirect measures of adiposity are unrelated to treatment effects in sustaining glycemic control. Additional studies are needed to understand the clinical markers of metabolic risk profile in youth with T2D on rosiglitazone. Copyright © 2019 by the American Diabetes Association.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Prediabetes is a highly prevalent health problem with a high risk of complications and progression to type 2 diabetes (T2D). The goals of this study were to evaluate the effect of the combination of lingaliptin+metformin+lifestyle on glucose tolerance, pancreatic beta-cell function and T2D incidence in patients with prediabetes.

   METHODS: A single center parallel double-blind randomized clinical trial with 24months of follow-up in patients with impaired glucose tolerance plus two T2D risk factors which were randomized to linagliptin 5mg+metformin 1700mg daily+lifestyle (LM group) or metformin 1700mg daily+lifestyle (M group). Primary outcomes were regression to normoglycemia and T2D incidence; glucose levels and pancreatic beta-cell function were secondary outcomes.

   RESULTS: Subjects were screened for eligibility by OGTT and 144 patients with prediabetes were randomized to LM group (n=74) or M group (n=70); 52 and 36 participants in the LM group and 52 and 27 participants in the M group, completed the 12 and 24months of treatment, respectively; average follow-up was 17+/-6 and 18+/-7months in M and LM group, respectively. Glucose levels during OGTT improved more in LM group. OGTT disposition index (DI) improved significantly better during the first months in LM group, increasing from 1.31 (95% CI: 1.14-1.49) to 2.41 (95% CI: 2.10-2.72) and to 2.07 (95% CI: 1.82-2.31) at 6 and 24months in LM group vs from 1.21 (95% CI: 0.98-1.34) to 1.56 (95% CI: 1.17-1.95) and to 1.72 (95% CI: 1.45-1.98) at 6 and 24months in M group (p<.05). T2D incidence was higher in M group in comparison to LM group (HR 4.0, 95% CI: 1.24-13.04, p=.020). The probability of achieving normoglycemia was higher in LM group (OR 3.26 CI 95% 1.55-6.84). No major side effects were observed during the study.

   CONCLUSIONS: The combination of linagliptin, metformin and lifestyle improved significantly glucose metabolism and pancreatic beta-cell function, and reduced T2D incidence in subjects with prediabetes as compared to metformin and lifestyle. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  The global epidemic of type 2 diabetes has prompted numerous studies and public health efforts to reduce its development. A variety of interventions, including lifestyle modifications and pharmacological agents directed at ameliorating the major risk factors for type 2 diabetes, are of proven efficacy in reducing the development of type 2 diabetes in people with impaired glucose tolerance. While prevention of the hyperglycaemia characteristic of diabetes is arguably an important, clinically relevant outcome, a more compelling outcome with greater clinical significance is the prevention or reduction of the relatively diabetes-specific microvascular and less-specific cardiovascular disease (CVD) complications associated with diabetes. These complications cause the majority of morbidity and excess mortality associated with diabetes. Any reduction in diabetes should, logically, also reduce the occurrence of its long-term complications; however, most diabetes prevention trials have not been of sufficient duration to allow such an evaluation. The limited long-term data, largely from the Da Qing Diabetes Prevention Study (DQDPS) and the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) and their respective follow-up studies (DQDPOS and DPPOS), suggest a reduction in microvascular complications and amelioration of CVD risk factors. Only the DQDPOS and Study to Prevent Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus (STOP-NIDDM) studies have shown a reduction in CVD events and only DQDPOS has demonstrated a decrease in CVD and overall mortality. While these limited data are promising, whether diabetes prevention directly reduces complication-related morbidity and mortality remains unclear. Longer follow-up of prevention studies is needed to supplement the limited current clinical trial data, to help differentiate the effects of diabetes prevention itself from the means used to reduce diabetes development and to understand the balance among benefits, risks and costs of prevention.

Abstract
  Management guidelines continue to identify metformin as initial pharmacologic antidiabetic therapy of choice for people with type 2 diabetes without contraindications, despite recent randomized trials that have demonstrated significant improvements in cardiovascular outcomes with newer classes of antidiabetic therapies. The purpose of this review is to summarize the current state of knowledge of metformin's therapeutic actions on blood glucose and cardiovascular clinical evidence and to consider the mechanisms that underlie them. The effects of metformin on glycaemia occur mainly in the liver, but metformin-stimulated glucose disposal by the gut has emerged as an increasingly import site of action of metformin. Additionally, metformin induces increased secretion of GLP-1 from intestinal L-cells. Clinical cardiovascular protection with metformin is supported by three randomized outcomes trials (in newly diagnosed and late stage insulin-treated type 2 diabetes patients) and a wealth of observational data. Initial evidence suggests that cotreatment with metformin may enhance the impact of newer incretin-based therapies on cardiovascular outcomes, an important observation as metformin can be combined with any other antidiabetic agent. Multiple potential mechanisms support the concept of cardiovascular protection with metformin beyond those provided by reduced blood glucose, including weight loss, improvements in haemostatic function, reduced inflammation, and oxidative stress, and inhibition of key steps in the process of atherosclerosis. Accordingly, metformin remains well placed to support improvements in cardiovascular outcomes, from diagnosis and throughout the course of type 2 diabetes, even in this new age of improved outcomes in type 2 diabetes.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety of a twice daily injection of insulin aspart (BIAsp) 30 and BIAsp50 in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) poorly controlled with oral hypoglycemic agents (OHAs).

   METHODS: In this 12 week prospective, randomized, parallel trial, a total of 80 T2DM patients, 59 +/- 10 years old with a disease duration of 9.3 +/- 6.6 years and HbA1c >7% despite large doses of metformin and sulfonylurea administration, were randomized to receive BIAsp30 (n = 40) or BIAsp50 (n = 40). The primary endpoint was a change in HbA1c at week 12.

   RESULTS: The changes in HbA1c from baseline were -2.5% +/- 1.0% in the BIAsp50 group and -2.5% +/- 1.2% in the BIAsp30 group (p = .897). No difference was observed in the rate of HbA1c target achievement (<7.0%) between BIAsp50 (42.5%) and BIAsp30 (32.5%) (p = .495). The change in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) in the BIAsp50 group was lower than that in the BIAsp30 group (p < .001), while the change in two-hour postprandial blood glucose (2hPBG) was higher and blood glucose excursion was lower in the BIAsp50 group than that in the BIAsp30 group (p < .001, p < .001). A significant improvement in HbA1c was observed with BIAsp50 in subgroups with baseline blood glucose excursion >7.8 mmol/L or 2hPBG >17.6 mmol/L compared with BIAsp30. There were no differences in hypoglycemia or body weight between groups.

   CONCLUSIONS: Compared with BIAsp30, BIAsp50 showed greater efficacy in patients with baseline BG excursion >7.8 mmol/L or 2hPBG >17.6 mmol/L as well as good safety for hypoglycemia.

Abstract
  AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15), a suggested biomarker for metformin use, may explain the potential cardioprotective and anti-cancer properties of metformin. We conducted a Mendelian randomisation study to examine the role of GDF-15 in risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) and breast and colorectal cancer. Secondary analyses included examination of the association of GDF-15 with type 2 diabetes, glycaemic traits, BP, lipids and BMI.

   METHODS: We obtained SNPs strongly (p value <5 x 10-8) predicting GDF-15 from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) (n = 5440) and applied them to genetic studies of CAD (CARDIoGRAMplusC4D 1000 Genomes-based GWAS [n = 184,305]), type 2 diabetes (DIAGRAM [DIAbetes Genetics Replication And Meta-analysis; n = 898,130]), glycaemic traits (MAGIC [the Meta-Analyses of Glucose and Insulin-related traits Consortium; HbA1c: n = 123,665; fasting glucose: n = 46,186]), BP, breast cancer and colorectal cancer (UK Biobank [n <= 401,447]), lipids (GLGC [Global Lipids Genetic Consortium; n <= 92,820]) and adiposity (GIANT [Genetic Investigation of ANthropometric Traits Consortium; n = 681,275]). Causal estimates were obtained using inverse variance weighting, taking into account correlations between SNPs. Sensitivity analyses included focusing on the lead SNP (rs888663) and validation for CAD in the UK Biobank and for breast cancer in the Breast Cancer Association Consortium.

   RESULTS: Using 5 SNPs, increased GDF-15 was associated with lower CAD (OR 0.93 per SD increase, 95% CI 0.87, 0.99) and breast cancer (OR 0.89 per SD increase, 95% CI 0.82, 0.96), with similar results from lead SNP analysis. However, the associations with CAD (OR 0.99 per SD increase, 95% CI 0.93, 1.04) and breast cancer (OR 0.97 per SD increase, 95% CI 0.94, 1.01) in the validation studies were not as apparent. GDF-15 was not associated with type 2 diabetes, glycaemic traits, CAD risk factors or colorectal cancer.

   CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: There is no convincing evidence that GDF-15 reduces risk of CAD or breast or colorectal cancer. Whether the observed inverse association of metformin use with cancer risk is via other unexplored mechanistic pathways warrants further investigation.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: The prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) continues to increase, and the disease burden is the highest of any medical condition in Korea. However, large-scale clinical studies have not yet conducted to establish the basis for diabetes prevention in Korea.

   METHODS: The hospital-based Korean Diabetes Prevention Study (H-KDPS) is a prospective, multi-center, randomized, open-label controlled study conducted at university hospitals for the purpose of gathering data to help in efforts to prevent type 2 DM. Ten university hospitals are participating, and 744 subjects will be recruited. The subjects are randomly assigned to the standard care group, lifestyle modification group, or metformin group, and their clinical course will be observed for 36 months.

   RESULTS: All intervention methodologies were developed, validated, and approved by Korean Diabetes Association (KDA) multi-disciplinary team members. The standard control group will engage in individual education based on the current KDA guidelines, and the lifestyle modification group will participate in a professionally guided healthcare intervention aiming for >=5% weight loss. The metformin group will begin dosing at 250 mg/day, increasing to a maximum of 1,000 mg/day. The primary endpoint of this study is the cumulative incidence of DM during the 3 years after randomization.

   CONCLUSION: The H-KDPS study is the first large-scale clinical study to establish evidence-based interventions for the prevention of type 2 DM in Koreans. The evidence gathered by this study will be useful for enhancing the health of Koreans and improving the stability of the Korean healthcare system (Trial registration: CRIS KCT0002260, NCT02981121).

Abstract
  The strategy for the management of type 2 diabetes (T2D) has been updated late 2019-2020 by a group of experts of the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD). The indications of two pharmacological classes that have demonstrated a cardiovascular and renal protection, i.e. sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1AR), are now extended because of the favourable results of recent clinical trials. In patients with T2D at high cardiovascular risk (even without previous event, but with indicators of atherosclerotic disease), the addition of these antidiabetic agents to metformin background therapy is now recommended independently of the glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) level. For SGLT2i, the prescription may be extended to patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate down to 30 (instead of 60) ml/min/1.73 m2, in particular in patients with progressive renal disease and albuminuria and in patients at risk of heart failure, especially if left ventricular ejection fraction is reduced. However, these new proposals could not be applied stricto sensu because of strict reimbursement criteria based upon HbA1c currently applied in our country.
Other Abstract
  Publisher Une actualisation des recommandations pour le traitement du diabete de type 2 (DT2) a ete publiee par un groupe d'experts au nom de l'American Diabetes Association (ADA) et l'European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) fin 2019-debut 2020. Les indications de deux classes de medicaments qui ont demontre une protection cardiovasculaire et renale, les inhibiteurs des sodium-glucose cotransporteurs de type 2 (iSGLT2) et les agonistes des recepteurs du glucagon-like peptide-1 (ARGLP-1), ont ete elargies au vu des resultats favorables des essais cliniques recents. Chez les patients avec DT2 a haut risque cardiovasculaire (meme sans evenement anterieur, mais avec des indicateurs de maladie atheromateuse), l'ajout de ces medicaments a la metformine est dorenavant recommande quel que soit le niveau d'hemoglobine glyquee (HbA1c). Pour les iSGLT2, la prescription peut etre etendue jusqu'a un debit de filtration glomerulaire de 30 (et non plus 60) ml/min/1,73 m2, en particulier chez les patients avec insuffisance renale progressive et albuminurie et chez les patients a risque d'insuffisance cardiaque, notamment si la fraction d'ejection du ventricule gauche est reduite. Ces nouvelles recommandations ne peuvent cependant pas encore etre appliquees stricto sensu, compte tenu des criteres de remboursement bases sur le taux d'HbA1c imposes actuellement pour ces medicaments dans notre pays.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the changes in inflammatory biomarkers between newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes (T2DM) patients under one-year acarbose treatments and those under metformin managements.

   METHODS: Seventy patients with newly diagnosed T2DM and 32 volunteers with normal glucose tolerance (normal controls, NCs) were enrolled. Seventy patients with T2DM were randomly assigned to two subgroups and treated with acarbose (n=34) or metformin (n=36) for 1 year. Blood glucose, insulin, glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C), triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and inflammatory biomarker levels (interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), interleukin-2 (IL-2), and ferritin) were detected at 0, 6 and 12 months.

   RESULTS: After adjusting for sex, the waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) and body mass index (BMI), higher fasting plasma glucose (FPG), standard meal test 1/2 hr and 2 hr glucose, TG, TC, LDL-C, IL-6, TNF-alpha, IL-2 and ferritin levels were observed in T2DM group than in NCs (P<0.05). After 6 months of treatment, TNF-alpha levels were significantly decreased in both subgroups, and IL-6 and ferritin levels were significantly decreased after 12 months (P<0.05). However, no significant differences in the IL-6, TNF-alpha and ferritin levels were observed between the two subgroups. Moreover, significantly higher IL-6 and TNF-alpha levels were detected in the T2DM group than in NCs after 12 months of treatment (P<0.05).

   CONCLUSION: Patients with newly diagnosed T2DM exhibited a marked chronic inflammatory state characterized by increased IL-6, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-2 and ferritin levels. After 1 year of treatment with acarbose or metformin, IL-6, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and ferritin levels were significantly decreased compared with the baseline. The anti-inflammatory effects of acarbose and metformin were comparable and required a long-term treatment (1 year), but the characteristics were different. Further investigations are needed to determine whether this effect was independent of the hypoglycemic effects.

Abstract
  Metformin is the most widely used glucose lowering drug worldwide in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes, since we have experience with this drug for more than 60 years about the efficacy and safety. Metformin is very effective in HbA1c lowering associated with some weight loss, but does not increase risk for hypoglycemia. At the moment all guidelines in the world recommend to use metformin in monotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed diabetes or in combination with other antidiabetic drugs with documented CV (and renal) benefit in cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOT). Although a randomized placebo controlled CVOT with metformin is lacking, many observational studies in patients with coronary heart disease, heart failure and chronic kidney disease have demonstrated consistent beneficial effects. A recent metanalysis of 26 observational studies including 815 839 patients showed that metformin use was associated with a significantly lower rate of all-cause mortality (HR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.68-0.81). Whether this very consistent reduction of all-cause mortality is related to the incidence/outcome of several cancers has still to be investigated. In the future early combination therapy of metformin e.g. with SGLT-2 inhibitors should be more often used. Copyright © 2019. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Abstract
  Type 2 diabetes mellitus has long been recognized as a major risk factor for adverse atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events; however, recent data indicate that heart failure is now emerging as the most common and morbid cardiovascular complication of type 2 diabetes mellitus. When heart failure develops in patients with type 2 diabetes, prognosis is ominous, highlighting the need for glucose-lowering therapies that can prevent heart failure, improve outcomes, or both. Prior to 2008, there was a paucity of randomized controlled trials evaluating long-term cardiovascular outcomes with glucose-lowering therapies. This changed after guidance on the assessment of novel glucose-lowering agents was issued by both the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency. Since then, significant progress has been made as a result of large cardiovascular outcomes trials. Though randomized controlled trials on insulin, sulfonylureas, and metformin are still limited, cardiovascular outcomes trials on newer glucose-lowering agents have included hundreds of thousands of patients with multiple years of follow-up. The increased risk of thiazolidinediones on heart failure had been well theorized and is now established; however, the increase in heart failure hospitalization with certain dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors was unexpected. The reasons for discrepancies with regard to heart failure risk with different dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors remain unclear, and further mechanistic studies are ongoing. The role of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists among patients with heart failure also remains unclear, and their effects may differ in patients with and without established heart failure, particularly those with decompensated heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: We aimed to retrospectively analyze the efficacy of 10 mg dapagliflozin (DAPA), which is a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor, in Korean patients with type 2 diabetes who visited a primary diabetes clinic.

   METHODS: In total, 83 patients with type 2 diabetes, who received treatment with DAPA for the first time in a primary diabetes clinic between January 2015 and October 2015, were included in the study. The effect of DAPA in lowering glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels was evaluated via chart review at 6 months follow-up. The patients were categorized into five groups according to add-on to or switched from other glucose-lowering agents: add-on to metformin (MET, n=10), add-on to MET+dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor (DPP4i, n=12), switched from sulfonylurea (SU, n=13), switched from DPP4i (n=11), and switched from thiazolidinedione (TZD, n=37). All the participants had already used MET for their regimen.

   RESULTS: Treatment with DAPA reduced HbA1c level by 1.2%+/-0.8%. Moreover, a significant decrease was observed in all subgroups: add-on to MET, -1.2%+/-0.7%; add-on to MET+DPP4i, -1.4%+/-0.8%; switched from SU, -1.4%+/-0.7%; switched from DPP4i, -0.5%+/-0.7%; and switched from TZD, -1.2%+/-0.9% (P<0.01). A significant decrease in body weight (-3.1+/-2.6 kg, P<0.001) was observed after DAPA administration. Estimated glomerular filtration rate and urine microalbumin were significantly decreased after 6 months of treatment with DAPA (-4.0+/-13.5 mL/min/1.73 m2, P=0.03; -23.6+/-45.9 mg/L, P<0.001).

   CONCLUSION: Treatment with DAPA, whether added to or switched from other glucose-lowering agents, significantly decreased HbA1c levels in Korean patients with type 2 diabetes who visited a single primary diabetes clinic. DAPA can be considered as an optimal second-line treatment for patients with type 2 diabetes, as supported by real-world evidence studies. Copyright © 2019 Korean Endocrine Society.

Abstract
  Treatment options for type 2 diabetes have expanded. While metformin remains the first line treatment in most cases, choices for second line treatment now extend beyond sulfonylureas and include the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1) receptor agonists, and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitors. SGLT2 inhibitors are recommended for people with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure or kidney disease. Diabetic ketoacidosis is an uncommon but important side effect; its occurrence can be minimised with appropriate patient education and management, especially during perioperative periods and times of illness. GLP1 receptor agonists are recommended for people with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Gastrointestinal side effects are common but are less prominent with the longer acting agents and can be minimised with slow titration of the shorter acting agents. DPP4 inhibitors are generally well tolerated, but alogliptin and saxagliptin should be used with caution in people with risk factors for heart failure. To optimise the management of type 2 diabetes, clinicians need to be aware of the pharmacological characteristics of each class of blood glucose-lowering medications and of the effect on cardiovascular health and renal function, balanced by potential adverse effects. Medications that have cardiovascular or renal benefits should be prescribed for patients with these comorbidities, and this is reflected in recent international guidelines.

Abstract
  PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Hyperglycemia contributes to a significant increase in morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs in the hospital. Professional associations recommend insulin as the mainstay of diabetes therapy in the inpatient setting. The standard of care basal-bolus insulin regimen is a labor-intensive approach associated with a significant risk of iatrogenic hypoglycemia. This review summarizes recent evidence from observational studies and clinical trials suggesting that not all patients require treatment with complex insulin regimens.

   RECENT FINDINGS: Evidence from clinical trials shows that incretin-based agents are effective in appropriately selected hospitalized patients and may be a safe alternative to complicated insulin regimens. Observational studies also show that older agents (i.e., metformin and sulfonylureas) are commonly used in the hospital, but there are few carefully designed studies addressing their efficacy. Therapy with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, alone or in combination with basal insulin, may effectively control glucose levels in patients with mild to moderate hyperglycemia. Further studies with glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor analogs and older oral agents are needed to confirm their safety in the hospital.

Abstract
  Introduction and aim: The of this research was to conduct a network meta-analysis based on a systematic literature search to compare the relative frequency of urinary tract infections using sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors combined with metformin in the therapy of type 2 diabetes. Method: MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched to identify publications of randomized, controlled trials investigating SGLT2 inhibitors combined with metformin in the therapy of type 2 diabetes and providing information on the frequency of urinary tract infections. Results: 10 165 unique citations were screened to identify 10 publications to be included in the network meta-analysis. The network meta-analysis showed reduced risk of urinary tract infections for low-dose ertugliflozin compared to other SGLT2 inhibitors (ertugliflozin 5 mg vs. empagliflozin 10 mg: RR: 0.606, 95% CrI: 0.264-1.415; ertugliflozin 5 mg vs. dapagliflozin 10 mg: RR = 0.853, 95% CrI: 0.301-2.285). For high-dose comparisons, empagliflozin 25 mg showed reduced risk of urinary tract infections compared to both ertugliflozin 15 mg (RR = 0.745, 95% CrI 0.330-1.610) and dapagliflozin 10 mg (RR = 0.680, 95% CrI: 0.337-1.289). The difference between active substances and their doses was not statistically significant for the relative frequency of urinary tract infections. The meta-regression revealed a statistically significant association between baseline fasting plasma glucose level and relative frequency of urinary tract infections (beta = 0.785, 95% CrI: 0.062-1.587). Conclusion:  There was no statistically significant difference between SGLT2 inhibitors investigated in this study in terms of the relative frequency of urinary tract infections. This research demonstrates the applicability of network meta-analyses when assessing the relative effectiveness and safety of interventions. Orv Hetil. 2020; 161(13): 491-501.

Abstract
  AIMS: Metformin could have benefits on cardiovascular disease and kidney disease progression but is often withheld from individuals with diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) because of a concern that it may increase the risk of lactic acidosis.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: All-cause mortality, cardiovascular death, cardiovascular events (death, hospitalization for heart failure, myocardial infarction, stroke or myocardial ischemia), end stage renal disease (ESRD) and the kidney disease composite (ESRD or death) were compared in metformin users and non-users with diabetes and CKD enrolled in the Trial to Reduce Cardiovascular Events with Aranesp (darbepoeitin-alfa) Therapy (TREAT) (NCT00093015). Outcomes were compared after propensity matching of users and non-users and in multivariable proportional hazards models.

   RESULTS: There were 591 individuals who used metformin at baseline and 3447 non-users. Among propensity-matched users, the crude incidence rate for mortality, cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular events and the combined endpoint was lower in metformin users than in non-users, but ESRD was marginally higher (4.0% vs 3.6%). Metformin use was independently associated with a reduced risk of all-cause mortality (HR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.36-0.69), cardiovascular death (HR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.32-0.74), the cardiovascular composite (HR, 0.67, 95% CI, 0.51-0.88) and the kidney disease composite (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.61-0.98). Associations with ESRD (HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.65-1.55) were not significant. Results were qualitatively similar in adjusted analyses of the full population. Two cases of lactic acidosis were observed.

   CONCLUSIONS: Metformin may be safer for use in CKD than previously considered and may lower the risk of death and cardiovascular events in individuals with stage 3 CKD. Copyright © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Abstract
  Metformin has been shown to modulate the cardiovascular response to intraduodenal glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM), and may have the capacity to regulate postprandial blood pressure (BP), which is often inadequately compensated in T2DM, resulting in postprandial hypotension. In the present study, we evaluated the acute effects of metformin on the BP and heart rate (HR) responses to oral glucose in patients with T2DM. Ten diet-controlled T2DM patients were evaluated on two occasions in a double-blind, randomized, crossover design. Participants received either metformin 1 g or saline (control) intraduodenally 60 minutes before ingesting a 50 g glucose drink labelled with 150 mg 13 C-acetate. BP, HR, plasma glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and gastric emptying (breath test) were evaluated over 180 minutes. Systolic and diastolic BP decreased and HR increased after oral glucose (P < 0.001 for all) on both days. Metformin attenuated the fall in systolic BP (P < 0.001), increased plasma GLP-1 concentrations (P < 0.05) and slowed gastric emptying (P < 0.05) without significantly affecting diastolic BP or HR. In conclusion, metformin acutely attenuates the hypotensive response to oral glucose, associated with augmented GLP-1 secretion and delayed gastric emptying, effects potentially relevant to its favourable cardiovascular profile.

Abstract
  AIMS: To characterize the glycaemic efficacy and safety of initiation of the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor sitagliptin during metformin dose escalation in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) not at glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) goal on a sub-maximal dose of metformin.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Study participants with HbA1c >=58 mmol/mol and <=97 mmol/mol (>=7.5% and <=11.0%) while on 1000 mg/d metformin were randomized to sitagliptin 100 mg once daily or placebo. All were to uptitrate metformin to 2000 mg/d. A longitudinal data analysis model was used to test the primary hypothesis that sitagliptin is superior to placebo when initiated during uptitration of metformin in reducing HbA1c at week 20. [ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02791490, EudraCT: 2015-004224-59] RESULTS: A total of 458 participants (mean HbA1c 71.1 mmol/mol [8.7%], T2D duration 6.3 years) were treated. After 20 weeks, the least squares (LS) mean changes from baseline in HbA1c were -12.1 mmol/mol (-14.0, -10.1) (-1.10% [-1.28, -0.93]) and -7.6 mmol/mol (-9.6, -5.6) (-0.69% [-0.88, -0.51]) with sitagliptin and placebo, respectively; the between-group difference in LS mean changes from baseline HbA1c was -4.5 mmol/mol (-6.5, -2.5) (-0.41% [-0.59, -0.23]); P < 0.001. The likelihood of having HbA1c <53 mmol/mol (<7.0%) at week 20 was higher in the sitagliptin group than in the placebo group in the overall population (relative risk 1.7, P = 0.002) and in those with a baseline HbA1c >=69 mmol/mol (>=8.5%) (relative risk 2.4, P = 0.026). There were no notable differences between groups with regard to adverse events overall, hypoglycaemia events, changes in body weight or other safety variables.

   CONCLUSION: In participants not at HbA1c goal on a sub-maximal dose of metformin, addition of sitagliptin at the time of metformin dose uptitration improved glycaemic response and HbA1c goal attainment, with similar safety and tolerability, compared to metformin uptitration alone.

Abstract
  Latino youth have the highest prevalence of overweight and obesity among all ethnic groups and are disproportionally affected by pre diabetes and type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Interventions that effectively reduce the risk of pre diabetes and T2DM in this population are urgently needed. Studies have shown that without any change, 50% of Latino children and adolescents will develop T2DM. This has important public health implications. Few pharmacologic options are approved for use in the pediatric population. The largest clinical trial to date did include a significant sample of Latinos, however the intervention used metformin or rosiglitazone in addition to lifestyle management and did not show meaningful weight loss, with around half of the participants meeting criteria for treatment failure. On the other hand, a smaller trial on surgical treatment of adolescents with severe obesity and T2DM resulted in superior glycemic control, reduced weight, and improvement of other co-morbidities of T2DM in youth. Lastly, culturally tailored programs that focus on building healthy communities appear to be a promising intervention to reduce diabetes risk in Latino youth. This review provides an update on the clinical aspects of T2DM in Latino youth and focuses on management and prevention strategies. Copyright © 2018. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Abstract
  AIM: This post hoc analysis explored whether mealtime fast-acting insulin aspart treatment provided an advantage in postprandial plasma glucose (PPG) control vs. insulin aspart in people with Type 2 diabetes receiving high doses of bolus insulin.

   METHODS: A post hoc, post-randomization, subgroup analysis of a 26-week, randomized, double-blind, treat-to-target trial (onset 2) that compared mealtime fast-acting insulin aspart vs. mealtime insulin aspart, both in a basal-bolus regimen, in people with Type 2 diabetes uncontrolled on basal insulin therapy and metformin. At the end of trial, the impact of fast-acting insulin aspart and insulin aspart on PPG control was assessed with a standard liquid meal test and participants were grouped into three post-randomization subgroups: meal test bolus insulin dose <= 10 units per dose (n = 171), > 10-20 units per dose (n = 289) and > 20 units per dose (n = 146).

   RESULTS: A statistically significant treatment difference in favour of fast-acting insulin aspart vs. insulin aspart was observed for the change in PPG increment at all post-meal time points (from 1 to 4 h) for those in the > 20 units bolus insulin subgroup. There was no difference in the magnitude of change from baseline in HbA1c level between fast-acting insulin aspart and insulin aspart in any of the bolus insulin dose subgroups (data herein).

   CONCLUSION: Fast-acting insulin aspart may hold promise as a more effective treatment compared with insulin aspart for controlling PPG in people with insulin-resistant Type 2 diabetes. Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Diabetic Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Diabetes UK.

Abstract
  PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a common pregnancy complication that has short- and long-term health implications for both the mother and child. While lifestyle modifications, insulin therapy, and oral agents such as metformin are effective, they can be difficult to adhere to, and there remain concerns over long-term effects of oral agents on the infant. Further, GDM has no proven preventive strategies, which could be more effective than treatment postdiagnosis. Nutritional supplements are an appealing, potentially safer, and better tolerated alternative to pharmaceuticals to treat and/or prevent GDM. Here, we review the existing evidence for nutritional supplementation for treatment and prevention of GDM.

   RECENT FINDINGS: There is limited evidence that myo-inositol, vitamins D and B6, magnesium, selenium, zinc, fatty acids, and probiotics might be beneficial for the prevention or treatment of GDM. There are very few studies for each nutrient, and the existing studies tend to have few participants. Where multiple studies of a nutrient exist, often those studies were conducted within the same country, limiting the generalizability of the findings, or alternatively there was no consensus across findings. There is limited evidence that nutritional supplementation of myo-inositol, vitamins D and B6, magnesium, selenium, zinc, fatty acids, and probiotics could improve glycemic control or prevent GDM. Our understanding is constrained by the small number of studies, small sample sizes in most studies, and by lack of consistency across findings. Further large, high-quality, randomized controlled trials are required to determine the efficacy of nutritional supplements to treat or prevent GDM.

Abstract
  CONTEXT: Altered tissue-specific glucocorticoid metabolism has been described in uncomplicated obesity and type 2 diabetes. We hypothesized that weight loss induced by diet and exercise, which has previously been shown to reverse abnormal cortisol metabolism in uncomplicated obesity, also normalizes cortisol metabolism in patients with type 2 diabetes.

   OBJECTIVE: Test the effects of a diet intervention with added exercise on glucocorticoid metabolism.

   DESIGN: Two groups followed a Paleolithic diet (PD) for 12 weeks with added 180 min of structured aerobic and resistance exercise per week in one randomized group (PDEX).

   SETTING: Umea University Hospital.

   PARTICIPANTS: Men and women with type 2 diabetes treated with lifestyle modification +/- metformin were included. Twenty-eight participants (PD, n = 15; PDEX, n = 13) completed measurements of glucocorticoid metabolism.

   MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Changes in glucocorticoid metabolite levels in 24-h urine samples, expression of HSD11B1 mRNA in s.c. adipose tissue and conversion of orally administered cortisone to cortisol measured in plasma. Body composition and insulin sensitivity were measured using a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, and liver fat was measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy.

   RESULTS: Both groups lost weight and improved insulin sensitivity. Conversion of orally taken cortisone to plasma cortisol and the ratio of 5alpha-THF + 5beta-THF/THE in urine increased in both groups.

   CONCLUSIONS: These interventions caused weight loss and improved insulin sensitivity with concomitant increases in the conversion of cortisone to cortisol, which is an estimate of hepatic HSD11B1 activity. This suggests that dysregulation of liver glucocorticoid metabolism in these patients is a consequence rather than a cause of metabolic dysfunction.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Role of multi-strain probiotic formulations in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has rarely been reported. In the present study, the effects of the probiotic formulation, UB0316 (L. salivarius UBLS22, L. casei UBLC42, L. plantarum UBLP40, L. acidophilus UBLA34, B. breve UBBr01, B. coagulans Unique IS2, 5 billion CFU each and fructo-oligosaccharides, 100 mg) in patients with T2DM were assessed.

   METHODS: A total of 79 eligible subjects (18-65 years, on stable metformin therapy) were randomly assigned to receive UB0316 or placebo, twice-a-day for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was change in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), secondary were assessment of blood glucose levels, HOMA-IR (homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance), insulin, body weight, and blood lipids. Quality of life, vital signs, physical investigations, safety and Physician/Subject's Global assessment were also evaluated.

   RESULTS: Twelve week multi-strain probiotic (UB0316) supplementation significantly reduced HbA1c (7.70 +/- 0.79%; p = 0.0023) and weight (67.00 +/- 8.82 kg; p < 0.001) as compared to placebo (HbA1c: 8.30 +/- 1.35%; weight: 67.60 +/- 9.46 kg). The changes recorded in fasting blood glucose (FBG), HOMA-IR, insulin, TC, TG, HDL, and LDL levels were however not significantly altered as compared to placebo. No severe adverse events, abnormal vital and physical signs were reported. The quality of life of T2DM was significantly improved.

   CONCLUSIONS: UB0316 significantly improved glycemic control as indicated by the decrease in HbA1c levels. There was also a significant decrease in weight in the probiotic treated subjects as compared to placebo.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated whether regression from impaired glucose regulation (IGR) to normal glucose regulation (NGR) after 1 year of a lifestyle intervention reduces diabetes risk in American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs). In addition, we sought to identify predictors for regression to NGR and understand possible mechanisms for the association between NGR and future diabetes risk.

   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Data from participants enrolled from 2006 to 2009 in the Special Diabetes Program for Indians Diabetes Prevention Program with IGR at baseline and an oral glucose tolerance test at year 1 were analyzed (N = 1,443). Cox regression models were used to estimate the subsequent diabetes risk (year 1 to year 3) by year 1 glucose status. Mediation analysis was used to estimate the proportions of the association between year 1 glycemic status and diabetes risk explained by specific factors.

   RESULTS: Those who reverted to NGR at year 1 (38%) had lower diabetes risk than those with sustained IGR (adjusted hazard ratio 0.28, 95% CI 0.12-0.67). The lower risk associated with regression to NGR was explained by both baseline risk factors and differences in weight loss. Metformin use, weight loss, and an increase in exercise were modifiable risk factors associated with higher odds of regression to NGR.

   CONCLUSIONS: Patients with prediabetes who reverted to NGR had a reduced risk of developing type 2 diabetes over the next 2 years. Both baseline and modifiable risk factors explained the risk reduction associated with NGR. Copyright © 2019 by the American Diabetes Association.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: Large numbers of people with type 2 diabetes are obese. However, changes in cognition and related brain function in obese people with diabetes have not been characterized. Here, we investigated cognition, olfactory function, and odor-induced brain alterations in these patients and therapeutic effects of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1Ras) on their psychological behavior and olfactory networks.

   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Cognitive, olfactory, and odor-induced brain activation assessments were administered to 35 obese and 35 nonobese people with type 2 diabetes and 35 control subjects matched for age, sex, and education. Among them, 20 obese individuals with diabetes with inadequate glycemic control and metformin monotherapy received GLP-1Ra treatment for 3 months and were reassessed for metabolic, cognitive, olfactory, and neuroimaging changes.

   RESULTS: Obese subjects with diabetes demonstrated lower general cognition and olfactory threshold scores, decreased left hippocampal activation, and disrupted seed-based functional connectivity with right insula compared with nonobese subjects with diabetes. Negative associations were found between adiposity and episodic memory and between fasting insulin and processing speed test time in diabetes. Mediation analyses showed that olfactory function and left hippocampus activation mediated these correlations. With 3-month GLP-1Ra treatment, obese subjects with diabetes exhibited improved Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score, olfactory test total score, and enhanced odor-induced right parahippocampus activation.

   CONCLUSIONS: Obese subjects with type 2 diabetes showed impaired cognition and dysfunctional olfaction and brain networks, the latter of which mediated adiposity in cognitive impairment of diabetes. GLP-1Ras ameliorated cognitive and olfactory abnormalities in obese subjects with diabetes, providing new perspectives for early diagnosis and therapeutic approaches for cognitive decrements in these patients.

Abstract
  Novel biomarkers of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and response to preventative treatment in individuals with similar clinical risk may highlight metabolic pathways that are important in disease development. We profiled 331 metabolites in 2,015 baseline plasma samples from the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP). Cox models were used to determine associations between metabolites and incident T2D, as well as whether associations differed by treatment group (i.e., lifestyle [ILS], metformin [MET], or placebo [PLA]), over an average of 3.2 years of follow-up. We found 69 metabolites associated with incident T2D regardless of treatment randomization. In particular, cytosine was novel and associated with the lowest risk. In an exploratory analysis, 35 baseline metabolite associations with incident T2D differed across the treatment groups. Stratification by baseline levels of several of these metabolites, including specific phospholipids and AMP, modified the effect that ILS or MET had on diabetes development. Our findings highlight novel markers of diabetes risk and preventative treatment effect in individuals who are clinically at high risk and motivate further studies to validate these interactions.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: This study aimed to compare the acute effects of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) versus moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) on glycemic control in middle-aged and older patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), using treadmill walking as aerobic exercise mode.

   METHODS: Fifteen patients with T2D (60.25 +/- 3.14 years; glycated hemoglobin 7.03 +/- 0.33%; medicated with metformin and/or gliptins), participated in a randomized controlled crossover trial. They underwent three experimental conditions (treadmill walking HIIT session (5 x (3 min at 70% of heart rate reserve (HRR) + 3 min at 30% HRR)); treadmill walking MICT session (30 min at 50% HRR); and a control session of rest (CON)) in random order and in the postprandial state. Measurements of capillary blood glucose (BG) were taken immediately before, during, and until 50 min after the experimental conditions.

   RESULTS: Both HIIT and MICT treadmill walking sessions reduced BG levels during exercise and laboratory 50 min recovery period compared to CON (time*condition interaction effect; p < 0.001). The effect of HIIT was greater compared with MICT (p = 0.017).

   CONCLUSIONS: Treadmill walking HIIT seems a safe and more effective exercise strategy on immediate acute glycemic control compared with MICT in middle-aged and older patients with T2D under therapy with metformin and/or gliptins.

Abstract
  Identifying factors that may impact vildagliptin's efficacy could contribute to individualized treatment for patients with type 2 diabetes. In the current study, we aimed to assess the correlation between patient baseline triglyceride (TG) and efficacy of vildagliptin in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes in a post hoc analysis of the VISION study. TG-based subgroup analysis was performed to evaluate baseline TG's impact on the decrease of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in patients receiving vildagliptin plus low-dose metformin (VLDM) vs. high-dose metformin (HDM). Additionally, multivariate linear regression was performed to assess the association between baseline TG and HbA1c reduction at weeks 12 and 24 for patients receiving VLDM vs. HDM. For patients receiving VLDM, baseline TG <= 2.03 mmol/L was associated with significantly greater HbA1c reduction vs. TG > 2.03 mmol/L at week 12, but not at week 24. Additionally, multivariate linear regression analysis revealed a significant independent association and an association short of statistical significance between patient baseline TG and the HbA1c-reducing efficacy of VLDM at weeks 12 (P < 0.001) and 24 (P = 0.082), respectively, while such association was absent for HDM. Collectively, baseline TG was an independent predictive factor for the efficacy of a dipeptidyl peptidase-IV in treating type 2 diabetes during its initial use.

Abstract
  AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Metformin is the endorsed first-line glucose-lowering drug for treating patients with type 2 diabetes but despite more than 50 years of use, no consensus has been reached on its mechanisms of action. In this study, we investigated the glucose-lowering effects of metformin in individuals with type 2 diabetes and non-diabetic individuals.

   METHODS: We performed a randomised, placebo-controlled trial in 24 individuals with recent-onset type 2 diabetes (diabetes duration 50 [48] months) who had good glycaemic control (HbA1c 48 mmol/mmol [6.5%]). The studies were conducted at Aarhus University Hospital between 2013 and 2016. Participants were randomised to receive either metformin (2000 mg/day, n = 12, MET group) or placebo (n = 12, PLA group) for 90 days, using block randomisation set up by an unblinded pharmacist. Two participants withdrew from the study prior to completion and were replaced with two new participants receiving the same treatment. In addition, we recruited a group of non-diabetic individuals with similar age and BMI (n = 12, CONT group), who were all treated with 2000 mg metformin daily. Before and after treatment all individuals underwent studies of whole-body glucose metabolism by non-steady-state [3-3H]glucose kinetics, hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamping, indirect calorimetry, metabolomics, dual x-ray absorptiometry and muscle biopsies. The primary study endpoint was the effect of metformin treatment on lipid kinetics as well as glucose rate of disappearance (Rd) and endogenous glucose production (EGP).

   RESULTS: One participant from the CONT group withdrew due to intolerable gastrointestinal side-effects and was excluded from analysis. As expected, metformin treatment lowered fasting plasma glucose (FPG) in the MET group (~1.5 mmol/l, p < 0.01), whereas no effect was observed in the PLA and CONT groups. Body weight and composition did not change in any of the groups. In both of the metformin-treated groups (MET and CONT), basal glucose Rd, EGP and glucagon levels increased by ~30% (p < 0.05) whereas this was not the case in the PLA group.

   CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Ninety days of metformin treatment resulted in similar increases in EGP and glucose Rd in individuals with recent-onset type 2 diabetes and in non-diabetic control individuals. These results challenge the existing paradigm that metformin primarily acts in the liver by inhibiting EGP, at least in individuals with type 2 diabetes of short duration and who have discretely affected glycaemic status. Whether metformin increases basal glucose Rd by facilitating glucose uptake in other tissues such as the intestines remains to be further clarified.

Abstract
  Given current lack of therapies for dementia, there is substantial interest in identifying potentially modifiable risk factors. Clarifying the potential of these factors to mitigate risk as well as determining the mechanisms that link these factors to dementia is expected to lead to new approaches for both preventing and treating neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease. Modifiable factors include cardiovascular risks as well as related lifestyle-centric factors such as diet and physical activity (reviewed in this issue). Given reports that type 2 diabetes and associated features increase the risk for developing dementia, there has been tremendous interest in exploring whether use of antidiabetic medications may impact the risk of dementia, as well as whether antidiabetic medications could be used to prevent or treat dementia, particularly Alzheimer disease. This review will briefly cover the known links between diabetes and risk for dementia, the state of evidence linking antidiabetic treatments with either protection against dementia or possibly increased risk for cognitive dysfunction, and provide a brief overview of what has been learned from clinical trials testing antidiabetic treatments in Alzheimer disease.

Abstract
  PURPOSE: Frailty is a syndrome of vulnerability and physical decline with aging that increases risk for disability, hospitalizations, and death. To date, interventions for frailty have primarily focused on exercise and/or nutritional interventions, many of which show improvement in frailty-related characteristics, such as gait speed and lower extremity strength and function. The goal of this article was to review prior research studies investigating interventions for frailty and review the literature with regard to the role of insulin resistance and inflammation in the development of frailty. Also included is a discussion of potential therapeutic interventions for frailty.

   METHODS: A literature search was conducted by using PubMed and the search terms frailty, interventions, and older adults. This review focused on larger studies (N >= 100 participants) that examined the effect of specific interventions on frailty as a primary outcome or on measures that are closely related to frailty, such as gait speed, muscle strength, and/or sarcopenia.

   FINDINGS: The results of prior studies of exercise interventions for the frailty syndrome as the primary outcome are mixed, with some but not all showing benefit. However, many exercise interventions have demonstrated improvement in components of frailty, such as strength, gait speed, and physical activity. The evidence shows that regular physical activity is beneficial for frail older adults or those at high risk of frailty and that the adverse effects related to exercise are minimal compared with the potential gains. However, questions remain as to the optimal type and duration of exercise and whether results of clinical trials are easily and feasibly implemented in a clinical setting in individuals whose motivation for exercise may be low. There is now increasing interest in pharmacologic agents that could potentially be useful in the prevention or treatment of frailty, in part based on advances in basic biology of aging research demonstrating that pharmacological agents extend lifespan in rodents. Several studies now show that obesity, insulin resistance, inflammation, and diabetes are associated with and predict frailty. Because metformin targets insulin resistance and inflammation, it is a plausible pharmacologic agent to prevent frailty. A clinical trial is underway to examine metformin's usefulness in frailty prevention.

   IMPLICATIONS: Although the benefits of exercise are known, adherence to these regimens may be difficult for individual older adults due to lack of motivation, access, or limitations due to chronic medical conditions. Studies are currently underway to examine novel agents for the prevention of frailty in older adults. Copyright © 2019. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Abstract
  PURPOSE OF REVIEW: There is consensus that metformin should be the first-line pharmacological therapy for type 2 diabetes. Although new evidence on effective treatments for type 2 diabetes is rapidly evolving, there is uncertainty regarding the optimal choice of second-line therapy. Our aim was to review the current major guidelines for second-line therapy in type 2 diabetes, along with findings from the recent cardiovascular outcome trials, focusing on two particularly promising classes of glucose-lowering drugs, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP1 RAs).

   RECENT FINDINGS: In the recent randomized controlled trials, two SGLT2 inhibitors (i.e., empagliflozin and canagliflozin) and two GLP1 RAs (i.e., liraglutide and albiglutide) reduced cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes, of whom most had established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Some clinical guidelines have changed their recommendations for second-line therapy based on these findings. The first choice for a second-line therapy by the new American Diabetes Association/European Association for the Study of Diabetes (ADA/EASD) guidelines is SGLT2 inhibitors or GLP1 RAs for patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure, or chronic kidney disease. For patients without these conditions, the ADA/EASD lists five options of noninsulin second-line therapy without a suggested hierarchy of use. On the other hand, the 2019 consensus statement from the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists/American College of Endocrinology lists nine hierarchical options, with GLP1 RAs as the first recommended therapy, followed by SGLT2 inhibitors and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitors, and sulfonylurea as the last option. The American College of Physicians recommends four oral treatment options, which do not include GLP1 RAs. The International Diabetes Federation recommends sulfonylureas, DPP4 inhibitors, or SGLT2 inhibitors as preferred second-line drugs with GLP1 RAs as an alternative in obese patients. The World Health Organization strongly recommends sulfonylureas in low-resource settings. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in the UK recommends DPP4 inhibitors, thiazolidinediones, or sulfonylureas, with use of SGLT2 inhibitors only under special circumstances. Clinical guidelines for the choice of second-line therapy in type 2 diabetes are inconsistent. A comprehensive assessment of the risks and benefits of second-line therapy is needed to address knowledge gaps that underlie core clinical practice.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: The incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) in children has increased dramatically. However, limited published information is known about the glycemic control and lipid outcomes in pediatric T2DM outside of clinical trials.

   OBJECTIVES: To determine the glycemic control and lipid measure outcomes at one and three- year follow-up in children with T2DM.

   METHODS: A retrospective electronic medical record review of children with T2DM at the Children's Hospital of Alabama over a 12-year period.

   RESULTS: There were 301 patients with a diagnosis of T2DM who had a 1-year follow-up visit, of which 184 also had a 3-year follow-up. Most patients (78%) received either insulin with metformin or insulin alone at diagnosis. At one year, 37% of the cohort achieved 'optimal glycemic control' (HbA1C <=6.5%) and 58% of patients achieved durable glycemic control (HbA1C <=8%). Optimal glycemic control was seen in 48 patients at 3 years. The patients treated with insulin (alone or in combination with metformin) tended to have higher HbA1C at diagnosis, but had improved lipid and glycemic outcomes at follow-up. The group treated with insulin along with metformin had significant improvements in non-HDL, HDL and TC/HDL ratios. The effects of insulin treatment on glycemic control at 3 years were not statistically significant.

   CONCLUSION: With the current modality of treatment, only a minority of patients achieve optimal glycemic control at 1 and 3 years of follow-up. Studies are warranted to further elucidate the optimal therapies in the management of pediatric T2DM.

Abstract
  AIMS: Glucagon has an important role in glucose homeostasis. Recently, a new plasma glucagon assay based on liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry was developed. We evaluated the influence of a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (anagliptin) on plasma glucagon levels in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes by using this new assay.

   METHODS: Twenty-four patients with type 2 diabetes were enrolled in a prospective, single-center, randomized, open-label study and were randomly allocated to 4weeks of treatment with metformin (1000mg/day) or anagliptin (200mg/day). A liquid test meal labeled with sodium [13C] acetate was ingested before and after the treatment period. Samples of blood and expired air were collected over 3h. Plasma levels of glucose, glucagon, C-peptide, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) were measured, and gastric emptying was also evaluated.

   RESULTS: Twenty-two patients completed the study (metformin group: n=10; anagliptin group: n=12). Glycemic control showed similar improvement in both groups. In the anagliptin group, there was a slight decrease of the incremental area under the plasma concentration versus time curve for glucagon after the test meal (P=0.048). In addition, the plasma level of active GLP-1 and GIP was increased, and plasma C-peptide was also increased versus baseline. Neither anagliptin nor metformin delayed gastric emptying.

   CONCLUSIONS: In patients with type 2 diabetes maintained endogenous insulin secretion, anagliptin increased the plasma level of active GLP-1 and GIP in association with a slight stimulation of insulin secretion and slight inhibition of glucagon secretion, but did not delay gastric emptying.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Many drugs are commercially available for use in the management of diabetes. However, their side effects and high costs underscore the need for herbal alternative drugs. Trigonella foenum-graecum is one of the medicinal plants which are important in the management of diabetes mellitus. This study investigated the effect of Trigonella foenum-graecum seed powder solution on the lipid profile of newly diagnosed type II diabetic patients.

   METHODS: A total of N = 114 newly diagnosed type II diabetic patients without any significant diabetes complication were selected. They were grouped into two groups: the treatment group (n = 57) consumed 25 g Trigonella foenum-graecum seed powder solution orally twice a day for one month and the second group is the control (n = 57) which receives metformin. Blood sample was collected from each participant by a medical technologist/technician before and after the study. Lipid profile was analyzed by using Mindray BS 200E fully automated clinical chemistry analyzer.

   RESULT: By the end of the intervention period, the treatment group showed significantly lower total cholesterol level by 13.6% as compared with the baseline level (219.1 +/- 35.51 vs. 189.29 +/- 29.06, P < 0.001) and the control group (189.29 +/- 29.06 vs. 208.2 +/- 40.2, P < 0.001); triglyceride level also reduced by 23.53% compared with the baseline level (256.1 +/- 15.4 vs. 195.8 +/- 82.95, P < 0.001) and compared with the control group (195.8 +/- 82.95 vs. 244.1 +/- 96.9, P < 0.05); and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level also reduced by 23.4% as compared to the baseline level (137.9 +/- 26.9 vs. 105.6 +/- 24.2, P < 0.001) and the control group (between groups) (105.6 +/- 24.2 vs. 144.1 +/- 23.3, P < 0.001), but the treatment group showed significantly increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level by 21.7% as compared to the baseline level, within group (37.8 +/- 1.51 vs. 48.3 +/- 11.9, P < 0.001), and the control group, between groups (48.3 +/- 11.9 vs. 36.01 +/- 9.5, P < 0.001). However, lipid profile levels in the control group were not significantly changed.

   CONCLUSION: The present study showed that the administration of Trigonella foenum-graecum seed powder solution had pronounced effects in improving lipid metabolism in type II diabetic patients with no adverse effects. Therefore, Trigonella foenum-graecum seed may provide new alternatives for the clinical management of type II diabetes. Copyright © 2019 Genet Alem Geberemeskel et al.

Abstract
  Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Atrial fibrillation (AF) and stroke are both forms of CVD that have major consequences in terms of disabilities and death among patients with diabetes; however, they are less present in the preoccupations of scientific researchers as a primary endpoint of clinical trials. Several publications have found DM to be associated with a higher risk for both AF and stroke; some of the main drugs used for glycemic control have been found to carry either increased, or decreased risks for AF or for stroke in DM patients. Given the risk for thromboembolic cerebrovascular events seen in AF patients, the question arises as to whether stroke and AF occurring with modified incidences in diabetic individuals under therapy with various classes of antihyperglycemic medications are interrelated and should be considered as a whole. At present, the medical literature lacks studies specifically designed to investigate a cause-effect relationship between the incidences of AF and stroke driven by different antidiabetic agents. In default of such proof, we reviewed the existing evidence correlating the major classes of glucose-controlling drugs with their associated risks for AF and stroke; however, supplementary proof is needed to explore a hypothetically causal relationship between these two, both of which display peculiar features in the setting of specific drug therapies for glycemic control.

Abstract
  Metformin is recommended as first-line therapy for type 2 diabetes because of its safety, low cost and potential cardiovascular benefits. The use of metformin was previously restricted in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) - a condition that commonly coexists with diabetes - due to concerns over drug accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis. There are limited data from observational studies and small randomised controlled trials to suggest that metformin, independent of its antihyperglycaemic effects, may be associated with lower risk of myocardial infarction, stroke and all-cause mortality in people with type 2 diabetes and CKD. Research into the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis in CKD has previously been limited and conflicting, resulting in significant variation across international guidelines on the safe prescribing and dosing of metformin at different stages of renal impairment. Present-day large scale cohort studies now provide supporting evidence for the safe use of metformin in mild to moderate renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] 30-60 mL/min/1.73m2 ). However, prescribing metformin in people with severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73m2 ) remains a controversial issue. Due to observed increased risk of lactic acidosis and all-cause mortality in people with type 2 diabetes and severe renal impairment, it is generally recommended that metformin is discontinued if renal function falls below this level or during acute renal deterioration.

Abstract
  Glycemic variability (GV) may be linked to the development of diabetic complications by inducing inflammation, oxidative stress, and endothelial dysfunction. Flash glucose monitoring (FGM) provides a novel method of continuously monitoring interstitial glucose levels for up to 14 days. This study randomly assigned poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus patients treated with metformin and multiple daily injections of insulin (n=60) to either continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) treatment or CSII in combination with liraglutide (CSII+Lira) treatment for 14 days during hospitalization. GV was assessed using a FGM system; weight and cardiometabolic biomarkers were also evaluated. The coefficient of variation was significantly reduced in the CSII+Lira group (P<0.001), while no significant change was observed in the CSII group. The changes differed significantly between the two groups in mean amplitude of glycemic excursions (P=0.004), standard deviation (P=0.006), and the percentage of time in the target range (4-10 mmol/L, P=0.005 and >10 mmol/L, P=0.028). The changes in mean of daily differences, interquartile range, and percentage of time in hypoglycemia (<3.3 mmol/L) and hyperglycemia (>13.9 mmol/L) identified by FGM showed no difference. Treatment with liraglutide increased serum adiponectin [33.5 (3.5, 47.7) pg/mL, P=0.003] and heme oxygenase-1 levels [0.4 (-0.0, 1.8) ng/mL, P=0.001] and reduced serum leptin levels [-2.8 (3.9) pg/mL, P<0.001]. Adding the glucagon-like peptide-1 analog liraglutide improved GV, weight, and some cardiometabolic risk markers. The FGM system is, therefore, shown to be a novel and useful method for glucose monitoring.

Abstract
  AIM: To evaluate the efficacy, safety and cost-effectiveness of ipragliflozin as an add-on therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

   METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science and four Chinese databases, as well as the ClinicalTrials.gov website were searched from their inception through Jan 2019. Methodological quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias, and meta-analysis was performed using RevMan5.3.

   RESULTS: A total of 11 randomized controlled trials with 1766 patients were included. Ipragliflozin administered (50mg) once daily as an add-on therapy to other glucose-lowering medications (metformin, pioglitazone, sulfonylurea, alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, sitagliptin, insulin) was associated with reductions in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of -0.74% (95% confidence interval (CI) -1.00 to -0.48), fasting plasma glucose (WMD -25.03mg/dL; 95% CI -32.89 to -17.16), weight, waist circumference, blood pressure, and triglycerides levels. Neither the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) (RR 1.08; 95% CI 1.00 to 1.16) nor drug-related TEAEs (RR 1.19; 95% CI 0.93 to 1.54) was significantly increased. However, it was associated with an increased risk of hypoglycemia when added to insulin (RR 1.71; 95% CI 1.13 to 2.61). Compared with the pioglitazone group and the sitagliptin+metformin group, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of ipragliflozin add-on therapy group was $4976.89, $2089.76 per percentage of qualified HbA1c, respectively.

   CONCLUSION: Ipragliflozin as an add-on therapy is well tolerated and effective. Ipragliflozin as an add-on therapy do not appear cost-effective compared with metformin alone, but may be competitive against pioglitazone group and the sitagliptin+metformin group.

Abstract
  AIM: This study aimed to assess efficacy and safety of evogliptin versus sitagliptin, when added to background metformin therapy in Indian patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes.

   METHOD: Overall, 184 patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes (7%<=HbA1c<10%) receiving >=8weeks of stable metformin monotherapy (>=1g/day), were randomized to receive add-on treatment (evogliptin 5mg or sitagliptin 100mg) for 24weeks. Primary endpoint was change in HbA1c from baseline to 12weeks (non-inferiority margin: <0.35).

   RESULTS: Mean reductions in HbA1c at 12weeks in evogliptin- and sitagliptin-treated patients were -0.37 (1.06) and -0.32 (1.14), respectively. The adjusted mean difference between treatment groups was -0.022 (95% CI: -0.374, 0.330; P=0.901), that demonstrated non-inferiority. Reductions in FPG and PPG were similar between evogliptin and sitagliptin at 12 and 24weeks. Changes in body weight were comparable between the treatment groups. Patients achieving target HbA1c<7.0% (evogliptin, 26.7% vs. sitagliptin, 20%) was almost equal in both groups. Treatment-emergent adverse events occured in 52 patients (evogliptin, 25% and sitagliptin, 31.5%) and were generally mild.

   CONCLUSIONS: Evogliptin was non-inferior to sitagliptin in HbA1c reduction. It effectively improved glycemic control and was well tolerated in type 2 diabetes patients inadequately controlled by metformin alone. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  Aims: This analysis evaluated the cost-effectiveness of once-weekly semaglutide vs glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) uncontrolled on metformin or basal insulin in Sweden. Materials and methods: This cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) was conducted using the Swedish Institute of Health Economics (IHE) Diabetes Cohort Model. Analyses were conducted from the Swedish societal perspective over a time horizon of 40 years. For patients uncontrolled on metformin, dulaglutide was the comparator, and data from the SUSTAIN 7 clinical trial was used. For patients uncontrolled on basal insulin, lixisenatide was chosen as the comparator and data was obtained from a network meta-analysis (NMA). Results: The results show that, in patients with inadequate control on metformin, semaglutide 1.0 mg dominated (i.e. provided greater clinical benefit, and was less costly) dulaglutide 1.5 mg. In patients with inadequate control on basal insulin, semaglutide 1.0 mg dominated lixisenatide. The reduction in costs is largely driven by the reduction in complications seen with once-weekly semaglutide. Limitations and conclusions:  It is likely that this analysis is conservative in estimating the cardiovascular (CV) cost benefits associated with treatment with once-weekly semaglutide. In patients inadequately controlled on basal insulin, the analyses vs lixisenatide were based on results from an NMA, as no head-to-head clinical trial has been conducted for this comparison. These CEA results show that once-weekly semaglutide is a cost-effective GLP-1 RA therapy for the treatment of T2D in patients inadequately controlled on metformin or basal insulin, addressing many current clinician, patient, and payer unmet needs in Sweden.

Abstract
  AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The aim of this study was to examine the effect of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery on diabetes remission, subsequent diabetes relapse and micro- and macrovascular complications in individuals with type 2 diabetes and obesity (BMI >35 kg/m2) in a real-world setting.

   METHODS: This was a population-based cohort study of 1111 individuals with type 2 diabetes treated by RYGB at hospitals in Northern Denmark (2006-2015), and 1074 matched non-operated individuals with type 2 diabetes. Diabetes remission was defined as no glucose-lowering drug use with HbA1c <48 mmol/mol (<6.5%), or metformin monotherapy with HbA1c <42 mmol/mol (<6.0%). Data on complications were ascertained from medical registries with complete follow-up.

   RESULTS: At 1 year of follow-up, 74% of the cohort treated by RYGB experienced diabetes remission, while 27% had relapsed after 5 years. Predictors of non-remission were age >50 years, diabetes duration >5 years, use of glucose-lowering drugs other than metformin, and baseline HbA1c >53 mmol/mol (>7.0%). Compared with the non-operated cohort using adjusted Cox regression (5.3 years follow-up), the cohort treated by RYGB had 47% lower risk of microvascular complications (HR 0.53 [95% CI 0.38, 0.73]) and a statistically non-significant 24% lower risk of macrovascular complications (HR 0.76 [95% CI 0.49, 1.18]). Diabetes remission vs non-remission at 1 year was associated with reduced HR of 0.43 (95% CI 0.25, 0.72) for microvascular complications and with HR of 0.76 (95% CI 0.40, 1.45) for macrovascular complications.

   CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In routine clinical care, three out of four individuals with type 2 diabetes and obesity treated by RYGB experienced diabetes remission after 1 year, whereas 27% of these individuals had relapsed at 5 years follow-up. RYGB was associated with substantially decreased risk of microvascular complications and non-significantly fewer macrovascular complications, with early diabetes remission as a clear predictor of reduced microvascular complications.

Abstract
  Model-based meta-analysis was used to compare glycemic control, weight changes, and hypoglycemia risk across 24 antihyperglycemic drugs used to treat type 2 diabetes. Electronic searches identified 229 randomized controlled studies comprising 121,914 patients. To ensure fair and unbiased treatment comparisons, the analyses adjusted for important differences between studies, including duration of treatment, baseline glycated hemoglobin, and drug dosages. At the approved doses, glycemic control was typically greatest with glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs), and least with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors. Weight loss was highly variable across GLP-1RAs but was similar across sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. Large weight increases were observed with sulfonylureas and thiazolidinediones. Hypoglycemia risk was highest with sulfonylureas, although gliclazide was notably lower. Hypoglycemia risk for DPP-4 inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibitors, and thiazolidinediones was generally very low but increased slightly for both GLP-1RAs and metformin. In summary, important differences between and within drug classes were identified.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: The last international consensus on the management of type 2 diabetes (T2D) recommends SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 agonists for patients with clinical cardiovascular (CV) disease; metformin remains the first-line glucose lowering medication. Last studies suggested beneficial effects of SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 agonists compared to DPP-4 inhibitors, in secondary CV prevention. Recently, a potential benefit of SGLT-2 inhibitors in primary CV prevention also has been suggested. However, no comparison of all the new and the old hypoglycemic drugs is available on CV outcomes. We aimed to compare the effects of old and new hypoglycemic drugs in T2D, on major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and mortality.

   METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a systematic review and network meta-analysis of clinical trials. Randomized trials, blinded or not, assessing contemporary hypoglycemic drugs on mortality or MACE in patients with T2D, were searched for in Medline, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and ClinicalTrials.gov. References screening and data extraction were done by multiple observers. Each drug was analyzed according to its therapeutic class. A random Bayesian network meta-analysis model was used. The primary outcomes were overall mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and MACE. Severe adverse events and severe hypoglycemia were also recorded. 175,966 patients in 34 trials from 1970 to 2018 were included. No trials evaluating glinides or alpha glucosidase inhibitors were found. 17 trials included a majority of patients with previous cardiovascular history, 16 trials a majority of patients without. Compared to control, SGLT-2 inhibitors were associated with a decreased risk of overall mortality (OR = 0.84 [95% CrI: 0.74; 0.95]), SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 agonists with a decreased risk of MACE (OR = 0.89 [95% CrI: 0.81; 0.98] and OR = 0.88 [95% CrI: 0.81; 0.95], respectively). Compared to DPP-4 inhibitors, SGLT-2 inhibitors were associated with a decreased risk of overall mortality (OR = 0.82 [95% CrI: 0.69; 0.98]), GLP-1 agonists with a decreased risk of MACE (OR = 0.88 [95% CrI: 0.79; 0.99]). Insulin was also associated with an increased risk of MACE compared to GLP-1 agonists (OR = 1.19 [95% CrI: 1.01; 1.42]). Insulin and sulfonylureas were associated with an increased risk of severe hypoglycemia. In the trials including a majority of patients without previous CV history, the comparisons of SGLT-2 inhibitors, metformin and control did not showed significant differences on primary outcomes. We limited our analysis at the therapeutic class level.

   CONCLUSIONS: SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 agonists have the most beneficial effects, especially in T2D patients with previous CV diseases. Direct comparisons of SGLT-2 inhibitors, GLP-1 agonists and metformin are needed, notably in primary CV prevention.

Abstract
  PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to systematically evaluate the effect of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor monotherapy on the weight of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and to compare different SGLT2 inhibitors with other oral glucose-lowering medications.

   METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and the ClinicalTrials.gov Web site were searched for relevant randomized controlled trials. Patients with T2DM in the included studies were administered SGLT2 inhibitor monotherapy for at least 12 weeks. The primary outcome was the change in weight from baseline; the secondary outcome was the proportion of patients achieving a weight reduction >=5%. A pairwise meta-analysis using the DerSimonian-Laird random effects model and a network meta-analysis with Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo random effects models were performed.

   FINDINGS: A total of 29 randomized controlled trials (11,999 patients) with a low risk of bias were identified. The results showed that the mean weight loss ranged from -2.26 kg (95% credible interval [CrI], -2.71 to -1.76) with canagliflozin 300 mg to -0.79 kg (95% CrI, -1.54 to -0.05) with ipragliflozin 25 mg compared with metformin. Compared with linagliptin and sitagliptin, the mean weight loss ranged from -3.17 kg (95% CrI, -3.67 to -2.57) with canagliflozin 300 mg to -0.93 kg (95% CrI, -1.92 to 0.05) with ipragliflozin 25 mg. Canagliflozin 300 mg reduced weight to a greater extent than the other SGLT2 inhibitors, with a probability of 99.44%. SGLT2 inhibitors also improved the proportions of patients achieving >=5% weight loss. The effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on weight reduction was associated with dosage.

   IMPLICATIONS: Available evidence from randomized controlled trials suggests that SGLT2 inhibitor monotherapy exerts more beneficial effects on weight reduction than both metformin and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors. The weight reduction effect of 300 mg canagliflozin is greater than that of most other SGLT2 inhibitors. More types of SGLT2 inhibitors in a head-to-head trial, as well as a comparison between SGLT2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists, will be involved in our further research.

Abstract
  AIMS/INTRODUCTION: Preprandial metformin administration significantly reduces postprandial plasma triglyceride levels in animal studies by reducing intestinal absorption through delayed gastric emptying. However, this effect has not been shown in a clinical study. Therefore, we planned to investigate the efficacy of preprandial metformin administration on postprandial hypertriglyceridemia and the related gastrointestinal effects in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 11 patients taking single-dose metformin at 500-1,000 mg, with non-fasting plasma triglyceride levels of 150-1,000 mg/dL, were recruited at a single university hospital. The difference between preprandial and postprandial metformin administration on postprandial hypertriglyceridemia was examined by a meal test. The gastrointestinal effects of metformin, including stomach heaviness, heartburn and satiety, were also assessed using a visual analog scale.

   RESULTS: The mean bodyweight of patients was 80.6 kg (body mass index 27.9 kg/m2 ), and the mean non-fasting plasma triglyceride level was 275.9 +/- 57.0 mg/dL. The area under the curve of triglyceride during the meal test was significantly lower in the preprandial protocol than in the postprandial protocol (P < 0.05). Compared with postprandial administration, preprandial administration of metformin increased satiety (P = 0.036) without stomach heaviness or heartburn.

   CONCLUSIONS: Preprandial metformin administration significantly reduced plasma triglyceride level during meal testing without marked exacerbation of gastrointestinal adverse effects. The present results suggest that a simple change in the timing of metformin administration represents a novel approach for enhancing triglyceride-lowering strategies in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and postprandial hypertriglyceridemia.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Several trials have reported that dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors are used to improve endothelial function in addition to treating type 2 diabetes (T2DM). The current study investigated the effects of vildagliptin, DPP-4 inhibitor, compared to metformin on endothelial function and blood pressure through vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) modulation in patients with T2DM and hypertension.

   METHODS: This study was designed as a randomized controlled parallel study. A total of 120 volunteers were recruited and allocated into 4 groups: healthy volunteers, patients recently diagnosed with hypertension and diabetes, patients treated with captopril for hypertension in addition to metformin, and patients treated with captopril in addition to vildagliptin. The percentage change in body weight was calculated in addition to serum VEGF levels, blood pressure, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), total lipid profile, and insulin resistance.

   RESULTS: At the end of the therapeutic period, the results showed that vildagliptin significantly decreased blood pressure and increased serum VEGF levels, while metformin was more effective at lowering body weight. In comparison with metformin, vildagliptin showed a promising action through its antihypertensive effect via elevating VEGF levels and improving physiological angiogenesis and vasculature.

   WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Vildagliptin showed a promising action through its blood pressure-regulating effect via modulating VEGF levels and improving physiological angiogenesis and vasculature, in addition to improving the lipid profile of patients, while metformin was better in reducing body weight.

Abstract
  Diabetes is a major health problem worldwide. Glycemic control is the main goal in the management of type 2 diabetes. While many anti-diabetic drugs and guidelines are available, almost half of diabetic patients do not reach their treatment goal and develop complications. The glucose-lowering response to anti-diabetic drug differs significantly between individuals. Relatively little is known about the factors that might underlie this response. The identification of predictors of response to anti-diabetic drugs is essential for treatment personalization. Unfortunately, the evidence on predictors of drugs response in type 2 diabetes is scarce. Only a few trials were designed for specific groups of patients (e.g. patients with renal impairment or older patients), while subgroup analyses of larger trials are frequently unreported. Physicians need help in picking the drug which provides the maximal benefit, with minimal side effects, in the right dose, for a specific patient, using an omics-based approach besides the phenotypic characteristics.

Abstract
  Two global epidemics, diabetes mellitus (DM) and tuberculosis (TB), have converged making their control even more challenging. We herein have reviewed metformin's (MTF) effect on patients with active and latent TB, as well as discussed its newly discovered biological mechanisms in mycobacteria. Mounting evidence suggests that MTF provides better outcomes in TB patients, especially those with DM. The mechanisms by which MTF produces its benefits are multiple. Though metformin's potential has been proven in patients with DM, larger and more thorough clinical trials, in DM and non-DM-TB patients, need to be conducted. MTF could be added to the arsenal of anti-TB drugs, aiding in the goal of TB eradication worldwide.

Abstract
  AIM: To assess the long-term clinical benefits of early combination treatment with vildagliptin-metformin vs. standard-of-care, metformin monotherapy in the ongoing VERIFY study.

   METHODS: We randomized 2001 participants with multi-ethnic background, aged 18-70 years, having HbA1c levels 48-58 mmol/mol (6.5-7.5%) and BMI 22-40 kg/m2 . Baseline data included HbA1c , fasting plasma glucose and homeostasis model beta-cell and insulin sensitivity. Standardized meal-tests, insulin secretion rate relative to glucose, and oral glucose insulin sensitivity were assessed in a subpopulation.

   RESULTS: Out of 4524 screened, data were collected from the 2001 eligible participants (53% women) across Europe (52.4%), Latin America (26.8%), Asia (17.2%), South Africa (3.1%) and Australia (0.5%). The median (interquartile range) disease duration was 3.4 (0.9, 10.2) months; mean (+/-SD) age 54.3+/-9.4 years; weight 85.5+/-17.5 kg and BMI 31.1+/-4.7 kg/m2 . Baseline HbA1c was 52+/-3 mmol/mol (6.9+/-0.3%), fasting plasma glucose 7.5+/-1.5 mmol/l and the median (interquartile range) of fasting insulin was 109 (75-160) mU/l. Homeostasis model beta-cell and insulin sensitivity values were 84% (60, 116) and 46% (31, 68), respectively. In those undertaking meal-tests, insulin secretion rate relative to glucose was 28+/-12 pmol/min/m2 /mmol/l and oral glucose insulin sensitivity was 353+/-57 ml/min/m2 .

   CONCLUSIONS: Our current, multi-ethnic, newly diagnosed VERIFY population reflects a characteristic presence of early insulin resistance in participants with increased demand for insulin associated with obesity. The VERIFY study will provide unique evidence in characterizing therapeutic intervention in a diverse population with hyperglycaemia, focusing on durability of early glycaemic control.

Abstract
  Background: Identifying reliable predictors of long-term weight loss (LTWL) could lead to improved weight management.

   Objective: To identify some predictors of LTWL.

   Design: The DPP (Diabetes Prevention Program) was a randomized controlled trial that compared weight loss with metformin, intensive lifestyle intervention (ILS), or placebo. Its Outcomes Study (DPPOS) observed patients after the masked treatment phase ended. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00004992 and NCT00038727).

   Setting: 27 DPP and DPPOS clinics.

   Participants: Of the 3234 randomly assigned participants, 1066 lost at least 5% of baseline weight in the first year and were followed for 15 years.

   Measurements: Treatment assignment, personal characteristics, and weight.

   Results: After 1 year, 289 (28.5%) participants in the metformin group, 640 (62.6%) in the ILS group, and 137 (13.4%) in the placebo group had lost at least 5% of their weight. After the masked treatment phase ended, the mean weight loss relative to baseline that was maintained between years 6 and 15 was 6.2% (95% CI, 5.2% to 7.2%) in the metformin group, 3.7% (CI, 3.1% to 4.4%) in the ILS group, and 2.8% (CI, 1.3% to 4.4%) in the placebo group. Independent predictors of LTWL included greater weight loss in the first year in all groups, older age and continued metformin use in the metformin group, older age and absence of either diabetes or a family history of diabetes in the ILS group, and higher fasting plasma glucose levels at baseline in the placebo group.

   Limitation: Post hoc analysis; examination of nonrandomized subsets of randomized groups after year 1.

   Conclusion: Among persons with weight loss of at least 5% after 1 year, those originally randomly assigned to metformin had the greatest loss during years 6 to 15. Older age and the amount of weight initially lost were the most consistent predictors of LTWL maintenance.

Abstract
  Basal insulin therapy often involves a compromise between achievement of glycaemic targets and avoidance of hypoglycaemia, dependent on how intensively insulin is titrated. In the Phase 3a EDITION 1, 2 and 3 studies, insulin glargine 300 U/mL (Gla-300) provided glycaemic control equivalent to that of insulin glargine 100 U/mL (Gla-100), with less hypoglycaemia in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The current study evaluated the rates of confirmed (<=3.9 mmol/L [<=70 mg/dL]) or severe hypoglycaemia over six months of treatment with Gla-300 or Gla-100 in the EDITION studies, as a function of HbA1c. Analysis was performed on patient-level data pooled from the three EDITION studies, and annualized hypoglycaemia rate as a function of HbA1c at Month 6 was fitted using a negative binomial regression model. Participants treated with Gla-300 experienced a consistently lower rate of confirmed (<=3.9 mmol/L [<=70 mg/dL]) or severe hypoglycaemia as compared with those treated with Gla-100, regardless of HbA1c at Month 6. Results suggest that treatment with Gla-300 vs Gla-100 could allow individuals with T2DM to achieve equivalent glycaemic control with less hypoglycaemia. Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

Abstract
  AIMS: The gastrointestinal tract, particularly the lower gut, may be key to the anti-diabetic action of metformin. We evaluated whether administration of metformin into the distal, vs the proximal, small intestine would be more effective in lowering plasma glucose by stimulating glucagon-like pepetide-1 (GLP-1) and/or slowing gastric emptying (GE) in type 2 diabetes (T2DM).

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten diet-controlled T2DM patients were studied on three occasions. A transnasal catheter was positioned with proximal and distal infusion ports located 13 and 190 cm beyond the pylorus, respectively. Participants received infusions of (a) proximal + distal saline (control), (b) proximal metformin (1000 mg) + distal saline or (c) proximal saline + distal metformin (1000 mg) over 5 minutes, followed 60 minutes later by a glucose drink containing 50 g glucose and 150 mg 13 C-acetate. "Arterialized" venous blood and breath samples were collected over 3 hours for measurements of plasma glucose, GLP-1, insulin and glucagon, and GE, respectively.

   RESULTS: Compared with control, both proximal and distal metformin reduced plasma glucose and augmented GLP-1 responses to oral glucose comparably (P < 0.05 each), without affecting plasma insulin or glucagon. GE was slower after proximal metformin than after control (P < 0.05) and tended to be slower after distal metformin, without any difference between proximal and distal metformin.

   CONCLUSIONS: In diet-controlled T2DM patients, glucose-lowering via a single dose of metformin administered to the upper and lower gut was comparable and was associated with stimulation of GLP-1 and slowing of GE. These observations suggest that the site of gastrointestinal administration is not critical to the glucose-lowering capacity of metformin. Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Abstract
  AIM: To assess the efficacy and safety of add-on therapy with the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor teneligliptin compared with sitagliptin in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) inadequately controlled with metformin and glimepiride.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, non-inferiority study of adult Korean subjects with T2DM (n = 201), with HbA1c ranging from 7.0% to 11.0%, on stable doses of metformin plus glimepiride. Subjects were randomized in a 1:1 fashion to receive either oral teneligliptin 20 mg or sitagliptin 100 mg for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was change from baseline in HbA1c.

   RESULTS: At baseline, mean age was 60.56 +/- 9.41 years, body mass index was 25.23 +/- 2.85 kg/m2 and HbA1c was 8.11% +/- 0.79%. At 24 weeks, both groups achieved significant reductions from baseline in HbA1c (teneligliptin, -1.03% +/- 0.10% [P < 0.0001]; sitagliptin, -1.02% +/- 0.10% [P < 0.0001]). The inter-group difference was -0.01% (95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.28, 0.26; P = 0.9497); the upper limit of the 95% CI was within the preset limit for non-inferiority (0.4%). There were no significant differences between groups in the proportion of patients achieving HbA1c targets, or changes from baseline in fasting plasma glucose, body weight or lipid levels at 24 weeks. Rates of adverse events (teneligliptin, n = 63 [61.76%]; sitagliptin, n = 61 [62.24%]; P = 0.9442) and hypoglycaemia (teneligliptin, n = 32 [31.37%]; sitagliptin, n = 28 [28.57%]; P = 0.6656) were similar.

   CONCLUSION: Teneligliptin was non-inferior to sitagliptin in the context of triple therapy for T2DM and is an important option in this setting. Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Abstract
  AIMS: Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists are appealing as glucose-lowering therapy for individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) as they also reduce body weight and are associated with low rates of hypoglycaemia. This analysis assessed the long-term cost-effectiveness of semaglutide 0.5 and 1 mg vs dulaglutide 1.5 mg (two once-weekly GLP-1 receptor agonists) from a UK healthcare payer perspective, based on the head-to-head SUSTAIN 7 trial, to inform healthcare decision making.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Long-term outcomes were projected using the IQVIA CORE Diabetes Model (version 9.0). Baseline cohort characteristics, changes in physiological parameters and adverse event rates were derived from the 40-week SUSTAIN 7 trial. Costs to a healthcare payer were assessed, and these captured pharmacy costs and costs of complications. Utilities were taken from published sources.

   RESULTS: Once-weekly semaglutide 0.5 and 1 mg were associated with improvements in quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0.04 and 0.10 quality-adjusted life years, respectively, compared with dulaglutide 1.5 mg. Clinical benefits were achieved at reduced costs, with lifetime cost savings of GBP 35 with once-weekly semaglutide 0.5 mg and GBP 106 with the once-weekly semaglutide 1 mg, resulting from fewer diabetes-related complications due to better glycaemic control. Therefore, both doses of once-weekly semaglutide were considered dominant vs dulaglutide 1.5 mg (improving outcomes and reducing costs).

   CONCLUSIONS: Compared with treatment with dulaglutide, once-weekly semaglutide represents a cost-effective option for treating individuals in the UK with T2DM who are not achieving glycaemic control with metformin, projected to both improve clinical outcomes and reduce costs.

Abstract
  AIMS: To assess the cardiovascular (CV) safety of oral semaglutide, the first tablet formulation of a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: PIONEER 6 is a multinational, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial in patients with type 2 diabetes at high risk of CV events (defined as being aged >=50 years and having established CV disease [CVD] or moderate [stage 3] chronic kidney disease [CKD], or being aged >=60 years with >=1 other CV risk factor). Patients were randomized to once-daily oral semaglutide (up to 14 mg) or placebo added to standard of care. The primary composite endpoint is time to first occurrence of CV death or non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke. The primary hypothesis was to exclude an excess in CV risk with oral semaglutide by assessing non-inferiority versus placebo for the primary endpoint (non-inferiority margin of 1.8 for the upper boundary of the 95% confidence interval of the hazard ratio). PIONEER 6 is event-driven, with follow-up continuing until accrual of at least 122 primary outcome events. There is no pre-defined minimal duration.

   RESULTS: Overall, 3183 patients have been enrolled (mean age 66.1 years, 31.6% females) in 214 sites across 21 countries. At baseline, the mean duration of diabetes was 14.9 years, mean glycated haemoglobin concentration was 66 mmol/mol (8.2%), and 84.6% of patients had established CVD/moderate CKD.

   CONCLUSIONS: PIONEER 6 will provide evidence regarding the CV safety of oral semaglutide in patients with type 2 diabetes and high CV risk. Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Abstract
  AIMS: To assess the effect of liraglutide on 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure and heart rate in patients with hypertension (pre- and stage 1 hypertension) and inadequately controlled Type 2 diabetes (glycated haemoglobin 7%-10% [53-86 mmol/mol]).

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eligible patients for this investigator-initiated, parallel-group, randomized, double-blind trial were on stable background antihyperglycaemic therapy excluding insulin, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 inhibitors. Participants were centrally randomized in a 1:1 ratio to daily liraglutide 0.6 mg, titrated to 1.2 mg after the first week, or placebo for 5 weeks. The primary outcome was change in 24-hour ambulatory systolic blood pressure (SBP), and secondary outcomes included change in ambulatory diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate. We also assessed renal sodium handling.

   RESULTS: Of 87 patients assessed for eligibility, 62 (66.1% men) with a mean age of 60.2 years were randomized to liraglutide (n = 31) or placebo (n = 31). All participants received background therapy with metformin, whilst 35.5% were treated concomitantly with sulphonylureas and 14.5% with pioglitazone. Compared with placebo, liraglutide reduced 24-hour SBP by -5.73 mm Hg (95% confidence interval [CI] -9.81 to -1.65) and had a neutral effect on 24-hour DBP (mean difference - 1.42 mm Hg; 95% CI -4.25 to 1.40), whilst increasing 24-hour heart rate by 6.16 beats/min (95% CI 3.25 to 9.07). Findings were consistent for daytime and night-time measurements. Liraglutide did not increase urine sodium excretion.

   CONCLUSION: Based on 24-hour ambulatory measurements, short-term treatment with liraglutide had a favourable effect on SBP whilst increasing heart rate. Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular (CV) disease (CVD) is a well-recognized complication of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and there is a clinical need for glucose-lowering therapies that do not further increase CV risk in this population. Although sulfonylureas (SUs) may be used as second-line therapy for patients requiring additional therapy after first-line metformin to improve glycemic control, their long-term effects on CV outcomes remain uncertain, and a wide range of alternative agents exist including dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors.

   METHODS: Literature searches in PubMed (2013-2018) were conducted with terms for DPP-4 inhibitors combined with CV terms, with preference given to cardiovascular outcomes trials (CVOTs). Reference lists from retrieved articles and diabetes guidelines were also considered.

   RESULTS: This narrative review discusses current evidence for the CV safety of these agents, describes the long-term CV effects of DPP-4 inhibitors, including effects on CV events, mortality, the risk for heart failure hospitalization, and highlights the need for further research into the CV effects of SU therapy. Although SUs remain a treatment option for T2DM, the long-term effects of these agents on CV outcomes are unclear, and further long-term studies are required. For DPP-4 inhibitors, uncertainties have been raised about their long-term effect on hospitalization for heart failure in light of the results of SAVOR-TIMI 53, although the findings of other DPP-4 inhibitor CVOTs in T2DM and data analyses have suggested these agents do not increase the occurrence of adverse CV outcomes.

   CONCLUSIONS: Based on recent CVOTs and guideline updates, the choice of add-on to metformin therapy for patients with T2DM and established CV disease should be a sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor or a glucagon-like peptide-1 agonist with proven CV benefit. Additional treatment options for those individuals who require therapy intensification, as well as in patients with T2DM and without established CVD include DPP-4 inhibitors and SUs. Since few head-to-head trials have compared the effects of different oral glucose-lowering agents on CV outcomes in T2DM, with most CVOTs using placebo as a comparator, the CAROLINA trial will provide important information on the comparative CV safety of a commonly prescribed SU and a DPP-4 inhibitor.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate tissue-specific effects of dapagliflozin on insulin sensitivity and liver and body fat in patients with type 2 diabetes.

   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled study recruited 32 patients with type 2 diabetes. Enrolled patients were to have HbA1c 6.5-10.5% (48-91 mmol/mol) and >=3 months of stable treatment with metformin, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor, or their combination. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive 10 mg dapagliflozin or placebo daily for 8 weeks. Before and after the intervention, tissue insulin sensitivity was measured using [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose and positron emission tomography during hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. Liver proton density fat fraction (PDFF) and adipose tissue volumes were assessed using MRI, and blood biomarkers were analyzed.

   RESULTS: After 8 weeks, glycemic control was improved by dapagliflozin (placebo-corrected change in HbA1c -0.39%, P < 0.01), but whole-body glucose uptake was not increased (P = 0.90). Tissue-specific insulin-stimulated glucose uptake did not change in skeletal muscle, liver, myocardium, or white and brown adipose tissue, and endogenous glucose production remained unaffected. However, there were significant placebo-corrected decreases in liver PDFF (-3.74%, P < 0.01), liver volume (-0.10 L, P < 0.05), visceral adipose tissue volume (-0.35 L, P < 0.01), interleukin-6 (-1.87 pg/mL, P < 0.05), and N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (-96 ng/L, P = 0.03).

   CONCLUSIONS: In this study, 8 weeks of treatment with dapagliflozin reduced liver PDFF and the volume of visceral adipose tissue in obese patients with type 2 diabetes. Although glycemic control was improved, no effect on tissue-level insulin sensitivity was observed. Copyright © 2019 by the American Diabetes Association.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To determine whether self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is associated with lower HbA1c in youth with type 2 diabetes taking oral medications only or after starting insulin for persistently elevated HbA1c.

   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Treatment Options for Type 2 Diabetes in Adolescents and Youth (TODAY) study participants (n = 699) taking oral medications were asked to perform SMBG twice daily. After reaching primary outcome (PO) (HbA1c >=8% [64 mmol/mol]) over 6 months or an inability to wean from temporary insulin because of metabolic decompensation), insulin glargine was started. HbA1c and percent of SMBG (SMBG%) (percent days when the meter was used one or more times) before and after PO were analyzed.

   RESULTS: SMBG declined over time and was inversely related to HbA1c (P < 0.0001). Of 298 youth who reached PO and started insulin, 282 had SMBG data. At PO, mean +/- SD age was 15.8 +/- 2.3 years, BMI 35.5 +/- 7.9 kg/m2, and HbA1c 9.6 +/- 2.0% (81 +/- 21.9 mmol/mol); 65.3% were female. Median SMBG% was 40% at PO, which increased to 49% after 6 months and fell to 41% after 1 year on insulin. At PO, 22% of youth checked >=80% of days, which increased to 25% and fell to 19% after 6 and 12 months using insulin, respectively. At PO, compared with those who checked <80%, youth who checked >=80% were younger and with a lower BMI, HbA1c, and blood pressure. SMBG >=80% was associated with >=1% reduction in HbA1c at 6 and 12 months after insulin initiation.

   CONCLUSIONS: Low SMBG adherence was common and associated with higher HbA1c. Optimal SMBG frequency in youth using or not using insulin, and whether less frequent SMBG is a marker for overall worse self-care, require further study. Copyright © 2019 by the American Diabetes Association.

Abstract
  Gestational diabetes mellitus, the most frequent medical complication of pregnancy, affects 5-6% of women in the United States with the use of the currently predominant Carpenter-Coustan criteria, which still represent the preferred approach of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Alternative criteria proposed by the International Association of Diabetes in Pregnancy Study Groups would likely increase gestational diabetes mellitus prevalence to 15-20%, because of both a 1-step testing policy and the requirement for only 1 elevated glucose value for diagnosis. Increasing gestational diabetes mellitus prevalence relates to older maternal age and the increasing prevalence of overweight and obesity. This increased gestational diabetes mellitus prevalence is consistent with 29.3% prevalence of prediabetes and 4.5% prevalence of known diabetes outside pregnancy in US adults from 20-44 years of age. Gestational diabetes mellitus according to the International Association of Diabetes in Pregnancy Study Groups criteria is associated with almost twice the risk of large-for-gestational-age babies, increased fetal adiposity, neonatal hyperinsulinemia and preeclampsia, and a 50% higher risk of preterm delivery and shoulder dystocia. The recent publication of the Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome Follow Up Study provides further evidence regarding the influence of gestational diabetes mellitus on long-term maternal and infant health. This study clearly demonstrates that hyperglycemia in pregnancy, untreated and identified post hoc by the International Association of Diabetes in Pregnancy Study Groups criteria, carries a 41.5% risk of maternal prediabetes (odds ratio, 3.72; 95% confidence interval, 3.09-4.47) and 10.7% risk of type 2 diabetes (odds ratio, 7.63; 95% confidence interval, 5.33-10.95) after 11.4 years of follow up. Gestational diabetes mellitus was also associated with higher rates of childhood overweight and obesity (prevalence 39.3% with maternal gestational diabetes mellitus; odds ratio, 1.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.56-2.44). This article places these findings in the context of other recent studies that have demonstrated that interventions that include lifestyle measures and/or metformin offer a >50% reduction in the risk of women with gestational diabetes mellitus experiencing the development of overt diabetes mellitus after their index gestational diabetes mellitus pregnancy. Although prevention of obesity and prediabetes in offspring by pregnancy treatment of gestational diabetes mellitus has not been demonstrated to date, we argue that the immediate pregnancy benefits and opportunities for long-term improvements in maternal health justify a reevaluation of the current ambivalent approach taken by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists to gestational diabetes mellitus diagnosis, which currently allow for a choice of alternative criteria. The Carpenter-Coustan or National Diabetes Data Group criteria, listed as preferred criteria by American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, markedly limit the frequency of gestational diabetes mellitus in comparison with the International Association of Diabetes in Pregnancy Study Groups criteria and limit the opportunity for immediate and long-term follow up and treatment. We consider that new information from the Hyperglycemia and Pregnancy Outcome Follow Up Study and other recent publications on long-term maternal and offspring risk provides compelling arguments for a more comprehensive approach to the promotion of maternal and infant health through all the life cycle.

Abstract
  Diabetes mellitus is one of the most prevalent metabolic diseases globally and it is increasing in prevalence. It is one of the most expensive diseases with respect to total health care costs per patient as a result of its chronic nature and its severe complications. To provide a more effective treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), this study aims to compare different efficacies of six kinds of hypoglycemic drugs based on metformin, including glimepiride, pioglitazone, exenatide, glibenclamide, rosiglitazone, and vildagliptin, in T2DM by a network meta-analysis that were verified by randomized-controlled trials (RCTs). Eight eligible RCT in consistency with the aforementioned six hypoglycemic drugs for T2DM were included. The results of network meta-analysis demonstrated that the exenatide + metformin and vildagliptin + metformin regimens presented with better efficacy. Patients with T2DM with unsatisfactory blood glucose control based on diet control, proper exercise, and metformin treatment were included. The original regimen and dose of medication were unchanged, followed by the addition of glimepiride, pioglitazone, exenatide, glibenclamide, rosiglitazone, and vildagliptin. The results of RCTs showed that all these six kinds of drugs reduced the HbA1c level. Compared with other regimens, exenatide + metformin reduced fasting plasma glucose (FPG), fasting plasma insulin (FPI), total cholesterol (TC), and homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR) levels, but increased the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) level; vildagliptin + metformin decreased FPI and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels; glibenclamide + metformin decreased the FPG level, but promoted HDL; and glimepiride + metformin decreased the TC level and rosiglitazone + metformin reduced the LDL level. Our findings indicated that exenatide + metformin and vildagliptin + metformin have better efficacy in T2DM since they can improve insulin sensitivity. Copyright © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract
  AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Individuals with type 2 diabetes have an altered bacterial composition of their gut microbiota compared with non-diabetic individuals. However, these alterations may be confounded by medication, notably the blood-glucose-lowering biguanide, metformin. We undertook a clinical trial in healthy and previously drug-free men with the primary aim of investigating metformin-induced compositional changes in the non-diabetic state. A secondary aim was to examine whether the pre-treatment gut microbiota was related to gastrointestinal adverse effects during metformin treatment.

   METHODS: Twenty-seven healthy young Danish men were included in an 18-week one-armed crossover trial consisting of a pre-intervention period, an intervention period and a post-intervention period, each period lasting 6 weeks. Inclusion criteria were men of age 18-35 years, BMI between 18.5 kg/m2 and 27.5 kg/m2, HbA1c < 39 mmol/mol (5.7%) and plasma creatinine within the normal range. No prescribed medication, including antibiotics, for 2 months prior to recruitment were allowed and no previous gastrointestinal surgery, discounting appendectomy or chronic illness requiring medical treatment. During the intervention the participants were given metformin up to 1 g twice daily. Participants were examined five times in the fasting state with blood sampling and recording of gastrointestinal symptoms. Examinations took place at Frederiksberg Hospital, Denmark before and after the pre-intervention period, halfway through and immediately after the end of intervention and after the wash-out period. Faecal samples were collected at nine evenly distributed time points, and bacterial DNA was extracted and subjected to 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing in order to evaluate gut microbiota composition. Subjective gastrointestinal symptoms were reported at each visit.

   RESULTS: Data from participants who completed visit 1 (n=23) are included in analyses. For the primary outcome the relative abundance of 11 bacterial genera significantly changed during the intervention but returned to baseline levels after treatment cessation. In line with previous reports, we observed a reduced abundance of Intestinibacter spp. and Clostridium spp., as well as an increased abundance of Escherichia/Shigella spp. and Bilophila wadsworthia. The relative abundance at baseline of 12 bacterial genera predicted self-reported gastrointestinal adverse effects.

   CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Intake of metformin changes the gut microbiota composition in normoglycaemic young men. The microbiota changes induced by metformin extend and validate previous reports in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Secondary analyses suggest that pre-treatment gut microbiota composition may be a determinant for development of gastrointestinal adverse effects following metformin intake. These results require further investigation and replication in larger prospective studies.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To examine the efficacy and safety for metformin in treating antipsychotic-induced dyslipidemia. Methods: Two randomized placebo-controlled trials were included in the analysis. A total of 201 schizophrenia patients with dyslipidemia after treatment with an antipsychotic were collected, and the patients were divided into two groups: a 1 000 mg/d metformin group (n=103) and a placebo group (n=98). The clinical symptoms and metabolic indicators such as body weight, blood glucose, and blood lipids were assessed at baseline, the 12th week and the 24th week after treatment respectively. Results: After metformin treatment, the mean difference in the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) value between the metformin group and the placebo group was from 0.16 mmol/L at baseline to -0.86 mmol/L at the end of the 24th week, which was decreased by 1.02 mmol/L (P<0.01). At the 24th week, the LDL-C was more than 3.37 mmol/L in 25.3% patients in the metformin group, which was significantly lower than that in the placebo group (64.8%) (P<0.01). Compared with the placebo group, there were significant changes in the weight, body mass index (BMI), insulin, insulin resistance index, total cholesterol and triglyceride, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in the metformin group (all P<0.05). The treatment effects on weight and insulin resistance appeared at the 12th week and further improved at the 24th week, but the effects on improving dyslipidemia only significantly occurred at the end of the 24th week. Conclusion: The metformin treatment is effective in improving antipsychotic-induced dyslipidemia and insulin resistance, and the effect to reduce the antipsychotic-induced insulin resistance appears earlier than the effect to improve dyslipidemia.

Abstract
  A concise way to evaluate pharmacotherapy options for type 2 diabetes mellitus is to use the five patient-oriented STEPS criteria: safety, tolerability, efficacy, price, and simplicity. The first-line treatment option, metformin, is safe and fairly well-tolerated, has excellent long-term efficacy for patient-oriented outcomes, is moderately priced, and has a simple dosing regimen. However, most patients with type 2 diabetes require more than one medication. The STEPS approach can help choose subsequent medications if metformin does not provide adequate glycemic control.

Abstract
  MARCH study suggested that acarbose had similar therapeutic effect on glycated hemoglobin reduction compared to metformin in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes patients as initial therapy in China. We aimed to investigate whether the efficacy of acarbose was still similar to metformin under different beta-cell function status. According to the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA)-beta level, 670 patients were divided into better beta-cell function group, medium beta-cell function group and poor beta-cell function group. Patients received acarbose 300 mg/d or metformin 1,500 mg/d for 48 weeks. We found both acarbose and metformin could decrease glycated hemoglobin to similar levels after 48 weeks treatment in all groups. In medium beta-cell function group, the decrease of fasting blood glucose after metformin treatment was more significant compared to acarbose (p = 0.040); however, the decrease of post-challenge blood glucose after acarbose treatment was more significant compared to metformin (p = 0.020). Moreover, in poor beta-cell function group, the decrease of body weight and body mass index after acarbose treatment were significant compared to metformin (p = 0.004 and p = 0.031, respectively). Therefore, acarbose contributed a similar therapeutic effect to plasma glucose control compared to metformin treatment, even under different beta-cell function status.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Fostering patient's self-managing of basal insulin therapy could improve glucose control, by removing patient's and physician's barriers to basal insulin initiation, titration and glucose monitoring. The Italian Titration Approaches Study (ITAS) aims at demonstrating non-inferiority (<0.3% margin) in efficacy of glucose control (change in glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c] after 24 weeks) by the same titration algorithm of insulin glargine 300 U/mL (Gla-300), managed by the (nurse assisted) patient versus the physician, in insulin naive patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), uncontrolled with previous treatments.

   METHODS AND RESULTS: ITAS is a phase IV, 24-week, national, multicenter, open label, randomized (1:1) parallel group study. 458 patients were enrolled, 359 randomized, and 339 completed the study, in 46 Italian centers. Baseline characteristics and previous medications of the ITT population (N = 355) are reported. Mean +/- SD age, T2DM duration, HbA1c, FPG and BMI were 64.0 +/- 9.8 years, 11.6 +/- 7.6 years, 8.79 +/- 0.65%, 170.9 +/- 42.3 mg/dL, and 30.3 +/- 5.6 kg/m2, respectively. Vascular and metabolic disorders were most frequent (73.8% and 58.3%, respectively). More than 90% of patients were on metformin.

   CONCLUSION: ITAS is the first study to compare two different managers (nurse-assisted patient vs physician) of the same titration algorithm of Gla-300 in insulin naive patients with T2DM in unsatisfactory glucose control. This study might provide novel evidence on the efficacy/effectiveness of patient-managed titration algorithm of Gla-300 in a pragmatic setting and may reduce barriers to basal insulin initiation and its titration.

Abstract
  For more than a century, the high occurrences of coronary and peripheral artery diseases in diabetes mellitus patients has been well recognised; despite that, the ability to improve CV event rates by optimizing glycaemic control has remained elusive. Nevertheless, the last decade has seen several cardiovascular outcome clinical trials (CVOTs) of many antihyperglycemic agents that reported promising results for cardiovascular and renal outcomes. This leads to a hot debate on the ideal drug choice for first-line treatment in T2DM. The purpose of this paper is to review the evidence supporting the use of metformin, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and incretin-based therapies for the management of individuals with T2DM and, discuss the rationale for selection.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Herbal medicines long have been used in the management of diabetes mellitus (DM).

   OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to ascertain if fenugreek compared with glibenclamide had any impacts on controlling blood glucose in patients with uncontrolled type II DM on conventional therapy.

   METHODS: A total of 12 patients with uncontrolled DM and on metformin were recruited and divided into two groups. Patients in group 1 received 2 g fenugreek per day, whereas those in group 2 received glibenclamide 5 mg once daily. The impacts of fenugreek on the glycemic control and lipid profile were measured before initiation of the regimen and then after 12 weeks.

   RESULTS: Only 9 of the 12 study participants completed the study. Fenugreek at 2 g/day caused an insignificant drop in fasting blood glucose (P = 0.63), but the fasting insulin level increased significantly (P = 0.04). The ratio of high- to low-density lipoprotein was significantly decreased from before to after treatment (P = 0.006). Fenugreek did not cause any notable adverse impacts on hepatic and renal functions throughout the study.

   CONCLUSION: Fenugreek could be used as adjuvant therapy to anti-diabetic drugs to control blood glucose, and further studies are needed.

Abstract
  Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of ipragliflozin as add-on therapy to metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Methods: Systematic literature searches were performed in several databases across PubMed, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, Medline, ClinicalTrials.gov, PsycINFO, and Web of Science from inception to 12 March 2019. After the extraction of data from eligible studies, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were assessed for quality and analyzed statistically. Standardized mean difference (SMD) and risk ratio (RR) with 95% CIs were used to evaluate efficacy and safety end-points. Sensitivity analyses and subgroup analyses based on intervention times were also performed. Results: Five RCTs with 847 patients were included. Compared to metformin alone, ipragliflozin as an adjuvant to metformin reduced glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in 12 weeks and 24 weeks, respectively [12 w: SMD -0.30, 95% CI -0.51 to -0.10%, p = 0.004; 24 w: SMD -0.88, 95% CI -1.04 to -0.72%, p < 0.00001; Total: SMD -0.66, 95% CI -0.79 to -0.53%, p < 0.00001]. In addition, ipragliflozin as adjuvant therapy to metformin body weight (Total: SMD -1.47, 95% CI [-1.80,-1.14], p < 0.00001), waist circumference (Total: SMD -1.09, 95% CI [-1.62,-0.56], p < 0.00001), and blood pressure (SBP Total: SMD -3.36, 95% CI [-5.11.-1.61], p = 0.0002; DBP Total: SMD -2.18, 95% CI [-3.63,-0.74], p = 0.003). Compared to metformin alone, ipragliflozin as an adjuvant to metformin showed significant risks in the skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders and constipation. Conclusion:  Compared to metformin alone, ipragliflozin plus metformin significantly improved glycemic control, reduced body weight, and lowered blood pressure; however, further high-quality trials are required to determine their long-term efficacy and safety.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety of sitagliptin compared with voglibose added to combined metformin and insulin in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes (T2DM).

   METHODS: In this 12-week prospective, randomized, parallel trial, 70 newly diagnosed T2DM patients with glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) >=9% and/or fasting plasma glucose (FPG) >=11.1 mmol/L were randomized (1:1) to receive sitagliptin 100 mg per day + metformin + insulin glargine or voglibose 0.2 mg three times daily + metformin + insulin glargine. Change in HbA1c at week 12 was the primary endpoint.

   RESULTS: The mean baseline HbA1c was 11.0% in the patients. The changes in HbA1c from baseline were -6.00% in the sitagliptin group and -3.58% in the voglibose group, and the between-group difference was -2.42% (95% CI -1.91 to -2.93, p=0.02). The differences in FPG and homeostatic model assessment of beta-cell function (HOMA-beta) and the change in body weight between groups from baseline were -2.95 mmol/L (p=0.04), 43.91 (p=0.01) and -2.23 kg (p=0.01), respectively. One patient (2.9%) in the sitagliptin group and three patients (8.6%) in the voglibose group exhibited hypoglycemia.

   CONCLUSIONS: Sitagliptin added to combined metformin and insulin therapy showed greater efficacy and good safety regarding hypoglycemia in patients with newly diagnosed T2DM compared with voglibose.

Abstract
  AIMS: To compare the efficacy of sitagliptin versus pioglitazone as add-on drugs in patients with poorly controlled diabetes with metformin and sulfonylureas.

   METHODS: This is a randomized, open-label, parallel assignment clinical trial. Patients who had inadequate glycemic control [7% (53 mmol/mol) <= A1C < 11% (97 mmol/mol)] despite a minimum 6-month period of active treatment with metformin 2000 mg/day plus gliclazide 240 mg/day were enrolled in the study. HbA1C, fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting plasma lipid parameters [total cholesterol (TC0, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglycerides (TG) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C)], systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP), weight, waist circumference, and body mass index were measured at baseline and after 17, 34, and 52 weeks of treatment. Generalized estimating equation analysis was done to compare treatment groups for continuous efficacy parameters.

   RESULTS: No significant difference in HbA1C reduction was observed between the treatment groups during the study course. (P = 0.149, adjusted P = 0.434; coefficient - 0.11 +/- 0.08). The FBG (P = 0.032; coefficient 7.44 +/- 3.48), HDL-C (P = 0.001; coefficient - 2.69 +/- 0.83), TG (P = 0.027; coefficient 12.63 +/- 5.71) and SBP (P < 0.001; coefficient 5.43 +/- 1.26) changes from baseline, and weight gain were greater in the pioglitazone group. The mean changes in LDL-C and TC from baseline to week 52 were greater in the sitagliptin group (P = 0.034; coefficient - 7.40 +/- 3.50, P = 0.013; coefficient - 7.16 +/- 2.88, respectively).

   CONCLUSION: Sitagliptin and pioglitazone were equally effective in improvement of HbA1C. There were some differences in terms of lipid indices, weight gain, and SBP. The current study confirmed that both sitagliptin and pioglitazone are effective treatment options and the decision should be made for each individual based on the baseline characteristics.

Abstract
  AIMS: GIOIA is an ongoing prospective multicentre study aiming to assess the vascular and metabolic effects of SGLT-2 inhibitors (gliflozins) and DPP-4 inhibitors (gliptins) in the routine clinical practice of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Herein we describe the preliminary effectiveness data at 6months.

   METHODS: SGLT-2i and DPP-4i-naive adult patients with T2D (N=301 and 260, respectively), with glycated haemoglobin A1c (A1C) >7%, an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) >=60ml/min/1.73m2, on background therapy with metformin, insulin or both, are being followed to evaluate markers of vascular (carotid intima-media thickness), myocardial (myocardial diastolic function) and renal (urinary albumin/creatinine ratio) damage during treatment with SGLT-2i or DPP-4i for a period of 24months.

   RESULT: At baseline, patients initiated on SGLT-2i are younger (about 6years) and more heavy (about 7.5kg), have higher A1C level (0.5% more), a longer diabetes duration and more CV events (20% more) than patients initiated on DPP-4i. At 6months, patients on SGLT-2i (N=298) and DPP-4i (N=258) exhibit significant ameliorations in A1C (-1.% and -0.7%, respectively), which were greater (-1.2% and -0.81%) in those on a background metformin treatment only. The composite endpoint (A1C<=7.0%+weight loss>=3kg) was achieved by 24% and 16% of patients receiving SGLT-2i or DPP-4i, respectively. No unexpected adverse events were reported.

   CONCLUSIONS: Both SGLT-2i and DPP-4i provide substantial improvements in metabolic parameters in the usual clinical practice of T2D, especially when used as second-line treatment. Copyright © 2019. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Abstract
  AIMS: Metformin and lifestyle intervention are frequently prescribed together as first-line treatments for type 2 diabetes. However, little is known about their interplay. We investigated if the effects of a lifestyle intervention on glycemia, body mass and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) were influenced by metformin therapy.

   METHODS: Participants randomized to intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) or diabetes support and education (DSE) from the Look AHEAD trial were categorized into metformin therapy vs. no metformin. A two-by-two ANCOVA (i.e., metformin therapy vs. no metformin by ILI vs. DSE) was used to examine the changes in glycated hemoglobin A1C, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), body mass, and CRF over the first year post-randomization, with a primary interest in the metformin-by-lifestyle interaction effect.

   RESULTS: Data from 1982 participants were analyzed. There was a significant metformin-by-lifestyle interaction effect on A1C (p=0.031) and FPG (p=0.043), resulting from larger reductions associated with metformin therapy compared to no metformin following DSE, but slightly smaller reduction associated with metformin therapy compared to no metformin following ILI. Metformin therapy was associated with smaller weight loss (-4.7+/-6.2 vs. -5.7+/-6.3kg; main effect: p=0.001) but not with differential CRF changes when compared to no metformin.

   CONCLUSIONS: The interaction between metformin therapy and lifestyle intervention on glycemia highlights the complicated nature of combining therapies. While the small influence of background metformin therapy on intensive lifestyle intervention should not discourage the concomitant use of these therapies, our results showed that, for individuals undergoing intensive lifestyle therapy, background metformin therapy conferred little additional benefits.

Abstract
  Context: The mechanism mediating sodium glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor-associated increase in glucagon levels is unknown.

   Objective: To assess short-term effects on glucagon, other hormones, and energy substrates after SGLT2 inhibition and whether such effects are secondary to glucose lowering. The impact of adding a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor was addressed.

   Design, Setting, and Patients: A phase 4, single-center, randomized, three-treatment crossover, open-label study including 15 patients with type 2 diabetes treated with metformin.

   Interventions: Patients received a single-dose of dapagliflozin 10 mg accompanied by the following in randomized order: isoglycemic clamp (experiment DG); saline infusion (experiment D); or saxagliptin 5 mg plus saline infusion (experiment DS). Directly after 5-hour infusions, a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed.

   Results: Glucose and insulin levels were stable in experiment DG and decreased in experiment D [P for difference (Pdiff) < 0.001]. Glucagon-to-insulin ratio (Pdiff < 0.001), and levels of glucagon (Pdiff < 0.01), nonesterified fatty acids (Pdiff < 0.01), glycerol (Pdiff < 0.01), and beta-OH-butyrate (Pdiff < 0.05) were lower in DG vs D. In multivariate analysis, change in glucose level was the main predictor of change in glucagon level. In DS, glucagon and active GLP-1 levels were higher than in D, but glucose and insulin levels did not differ. During OGTT, glucose levels rose less and glucagon levels fell more in DS vs D.

   Conclusion: The degree of glucose lowering markedly contributed to regulation of glucagon and insulin secretion and to lipid mobilization during short-term SGLT2 inhibition.

Abstract
  To evaluate the combined effect of age and glycemic state on circulating levels of the inflamma-miR-146a levels, 188 healthy subjects (CTR) aged 20-104 years and 144 type-2 diabetic patients (T2DM), aged 40-80 years, were analyzed. In CTR subjects, miR-146a levels showed a significant age-related decline. When a gender-stratified analysis was ran, the miR-146a age-related trajectory was confirmed only in men and a negative correlation with PAI-1, uric acid, and creatinine was also observed. In women, miR-146a circulating levels showed negative correlations with azotemia, uric acid, waist/hip ratio and ferritin. A significant miR-146a decline with aging was also observed in T2DM patients. Significant positive correlations were found between miR-146a in diabetic patients and total cholesterol, LDL-C, ApoA1, ApoB, and platelets, and negative correlations with serum iron and ferritin. Notably, miR-146a was significantly overexpressed in T2DM patients treated with metformin. MiR-146a levels were significantly lower in diabetic patients than in age-matched CTR and negatively correlated to both fasting glucose and HbA1c in males. Finally, age-related trajectories for circulating miR-146a levels showed an inverted U-shaped relationship; however, in T2DM patients the trajectory was significantly shifted towards lower levels. Our findings support the hypothesis that miR-146a could be a functional biomarker of healthy/unhealthy aging. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  AIM: The aim of this study was to analyze the efficacy, insulin sensitivity and safety in the event of administering sulfonylurea-based drugs and metformin in combination with basal insulin.

   METHODS: A randomized, open-label, parallel, 16-week trial was conducted across four study centers. The 97 type 2 diabetic patients were selected and randomized into two groups, the insulin glargine plus fixed-dose combination glimepiride 1mg and metformin 500mg twice daily group (the G/M group) and the insulin glargine plus glimepiride 4mg once daily group (the G group). The primary endpoint evaluated was change in HbA1c. The secondary endpoints evaluated were changes in fasting blood glucose (FPG), 2-h post prandial glucose (PPG 2h), insulin, and C-peptide levels.

   RESULTS: The G/M group was found to have experienced a significantly greater decrease in HbA1c, as well as PPG 2h compared to the G group. While no significant intergroup difference was found regarding FPG in the ITT, the G/M group in the PP set experienced a significantly greater decrease in FPG.

   CONCLUSION: Comparison of combined therapy consisting of either the G/M group or the G group indicated that both forms of therapy are relatively safe but that the former more effectively decreases blood glucose levels. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  Objective: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is more common in Hispanic than non-Hispanic white (NHW) populations worldwide, and ethnicity, among other factors, may affect response to therapy. The efficacy and safety of insulin glargine 100 units/mL (iGlar) and the fixed-ratio combination of iGlar and the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist lixisenatide (iGlarLixi) was assessed in Hispanic and NHW patients with T2D from 25 countries. Methods: In this post hoc analysis, data from two 30-week randomized controlled trials comparing iGlar and iGlarLixi in patients with T2D uncontrolled on basal insulin +/- oral antidiabetes drugs (OADs; LixiLan-L: NCT02058160) or uncontrolled on metformin +/- OADs (LixiLan-O: NCT02058147) were evaluated. Results: Of the 1,512 patients included across trials, 301 were Hispanic and 1,211 NHW. Compared with iGlar, iGlarLixi resulted in greater reductions in glycated hemoglobin (A1C) and 2-hour postprandial glucose and a higher proportion of patients at target A1C <7.0% (<53 mmol/mol), regardless of ethnicity. Among NHWs from the LixiLan-L trial, documented symptomatic hypoglycemia (plasma glucose <=70 mg/dL) rates were higher with iGlar compared with iGlarLixi (P = .06), whereas this trend was reversed among Hispanics (P = .07). Nevertheless, in both trials, a greater proportion of patients taking iGlarLixi than iGlar reached the composite efficacy endpoints of target A1C without hypoglycemia and target A1C without weight gain, regardless of ethnicity. Conclusion:  These results indicate that iGlarLixi is a viable therapeutic option for both Hispanic and NHW patients with T2D, as it is efficacious without a significant increase in hypoglycemia, irrespective of ethnicity.

Abstract
  Introduction: A growth in the market for anti-diabetic drugs, along with an ever-increasing population suffering from type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), requires a critical re-evaluation of anti-diabetic drugs used for a long time, in order to provide up-to-date practical prescribing information for clinicians. Alogliptin benzoate was firstly approved in 2010 in Japan for T2DM, both as a monotherapy or in combination with other anti-diabetic drugs. Areas covered: This article provides a comprehensive review of the latest data on alogliptin benzoate, including hypoglycemic activity and safety. Expert opinion: The cumulative evidence for alogliptin benzoate is robust with regards to glycemic efficacy and safety. Low hypoglycemia risks and weight changes support its consideration as a first-line medication for T2DM, either as a monotherapy or in combination therapy with other anti-diabetic drugs such as metformin. Ongoing trials will look to better analyze and address its safety and efficacy in pediatric patients and expand our clinical knowledge of this medication.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Metformin reduces plasma glucose and has been shown to increase glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) secretion. Whether this is a direct action of metformin on GLP-1 release, and whether some of the glucose-lowering effect of metformin occurs due to GLP-1 release, is unknown. The current study investigated metformin-induced GLP-1 secretion and its contribution to the overall glucose-lowering effect of metformin and underlying mechanisms in patients with type 2 diabetes.

   METHODS: Twelve patients with type 2 diabetes were included in this placebo-controlled, double-blinded study. On 4 separate days, the patients received metformin (1,500 mg) or placebo suspended in a liquid meal, with subsequent i.v. infusion of the GLP-1 receptor antagonist exendin9-39 (Ex9-39) or saline. During 240 minutes, blood was sampled. The direct effect of metformin on GLP-1 secretion was tested ex vivo in human ileal and colonic tissue with and without dorsomorphin-induced inhibiting of the AMPK activity.

   RESULTS: Metformin increased postprandial GLP-1 secretion compared with placebo (P = 0.014), and the postprandial glucose excursions were significantly smaller after metformin + saline compared with metformin + Ex9-39 (P = 0.004). Ex vivo metformin acutely increased GLP-1 secretion (colonic tissue, P < 0.01; ileal tissue, P < 0.05), but the effect was abolished by inhibition of AMPK activity.

   CONCLUSIONS: Metformin has a direct and AMPK-dependent effect on GLP-1-secreting L cells and increases postprandial GLP-1 secretion, which seems to contribute to metformin's glucose-lowering effect and mode of action.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVES: The efficacy of dapagliflozin as add-on therapy to metformin has been assessed in randomized trials. However, its effectiveness has not been assessed in a US real-world setting.

   METHODS: Electronic medical record (EMR) data were used to compare clinical outcomes among patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) treated with dapagliflozin and metformin with or without other oral antidiabetic drugs (D + M +/- OAD), versus metformin with at least 1 other OAD (M + OAD). Adult patients with T2D on these regimens from January 01, 2014, to February 28, 2015, were identified in a US EMR database, with the date of first prescription for dapagliflozin (D + M +/- OAD) or other OAD (M + OAD) as the index date. Patients were observed for 12 months before the index date (baseline) and 12 months afterward (ie, follow-up). Patients in the M + OAD group were propensity score matched 1:1 to those in the D + M +/- OAD group. Outcomes included change in glycated hemoglobin (A1C) level, weight, and systolic and diastolic blood pressures (SBP/DBP) from baseline to follow-up.

   RESULTS: A total of 1093 patients receiving M + OAD were matched to 1093 patients receiving D + M +/- OAD. Compared with those given M + OAD, patients given D + M +/- OAD had a greater reduction in A1C level (mean, -1.0% vs -0.7%; P <.01), greater weight loss (-1.8 kg vs -0.7 kg, P <.01), and greater change in SBP (-3.6 mm Hg vs -0.1 mm Hg, P <.01) and DBP (-2.0 mm Hg vs -0.6 mm Hg, P <.01) from baseline to follow-up.

   CONCLUSIONS: In current US clinical practice, patients receiving D + M +/- OAD had greater reductions in important clinical outcomes of T2D-A1C level, weight loss, and blood pressure-versus patients receiving M + OAD. This study supports the use of dapagliflozin as add-on therapy to metformin with or without other OADs for patients with T2D.

Abstract
  The main objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of metformin, statins and anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on head and neck cancer (HNC). Specifically, the potential beneficial effects on risk, survival and recurrence based on epidemiological studies. PRISMA guidelines were followed. After searching MEDLINE (PubMed), IBECS, LILACS and the Cochrane Central Register for Controlled Trials, 13 studies met the inclusion criteria and so underwent qualitative synthesis (six studies for metformin and seven for NSAIDs). No studies were found for statins. Studies varied in their methodological quality. Meta-analyses showed that metformin exerts significant beneficial effects on HNC risk (RR=0.71 95% CI 0.61-0.84) and overall survival (RR=1.71 95% CI 1.20-2.42). Qualitative synthesis also suggests an apparently dose-response relationship and increased benefit when administered alone. The pooled-analyses yielded an almost significant effect of NSAIDs on HNC risk (RR=0.86 95% CI 0.74-1.01). No associations were found between aspirin use and the risk of HNC (RR=0.98 95% CI 0.77-1.24) and overall survival (RR=1.10 95% CI 0.89-1.36). Metformin appears to have beneficial effects on HNC risk and overall survival, with an apparently dose-response relationship and increased benefit when administered alone. NSAIDs also seem to have a modest beneficial effect on HNC risk. No definitive conclusions can be reached for aspirin as the evidence available was proved inconsistent. Further research by means of well designed and conducted studies are needed to determine firm clinical implications. Standardized assessment methods for HNC outcomes should be established and account for known confounding factors such as smoking and alcohol consumption. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Identification of a safe and effective medical therapy for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) disease remains a significant unmet medical need. Recent small cohort studies indicate that metformin, the world's most commonly prescribed oral hypoglycemic agent, may limit AAA enlargement. We sought to validate these preliminary observations in a larger cohort.

   METHODS: All patients with asymptomatic AAA disease managed in the Veterans Affairs Health Care System between 2003 and 2013 were identified by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes. Those with a concomitant diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who also received two or more abdominal imaging studies (computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or ultrasound) documenting the presence and size of an AAA, separated by at least 1 year, were included for review. Maximal AAA diameters were determined from radiologic reports. Further data acquisition was censored after surgical AAA repair, when performed. Comorbidities, active smoking status, and outpatient medication records (within 6 months of AAA diagnosis) were also queried. Yearly AAA enlargement rates, as a function of metformin treatment status, were compared using two statistical models expressed in millimeters per year: a multivariate linear regression (model 1) and a multivariate mixed-effects model with random intercept and random slope (model 2).

   RESULTS: A total of 13,834 patients with 58,833 radiographic records were included in the analysis, with radiology imaging follow-up of 4.2 +/- 2.6 years (mean +/- standard deviation). The average age of the patients at AAA diagnosis was 69.8 +/- 7.8 years, and 39.7% had a metformin prescription within +/-6 months of AAA. The mean growth rate for AAAs in the entire cohort was 1.4 +/- 2.0 mm/y by model 1 analysis and 1.3 +/- 1.6 mm/y by model 2 analysis. The unadjusted mean rate of AAA growth was 1.2 +/- 1.9 mm/y for patients prescribed metformin compared with 1.5 +/- 2.2 mm/y for those without (P < .001), a 20% decrease. This effect remained significant when adjusted for variables relevant on AAA progression: metformin prescription was associated with a reduction in yearly AAA growth rate of -0.23 mm (95% confidence interval, -0.35 to -0.16; P < .001) by model 1 analysis and 0.20 mm/y (95% confidence interval, -0.26 to -0.14; P < .001) by model 2 analysis. A subset analysis of 7462 patients with baseline AAA size of 35 to 49 mm showed a similar inhibitory effect (1.4 +/- 2.0 mm/y to 1.7 +/- 2.2 mm/y; P < .001). Patients' factors associated with an increased yearly AAA growth rate were baseline AAA size, metastatic solid tumors, active smoking, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and chronic renal disease. Factors associated with decreased yearly AAA growth rates included prescriptions for angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers or sulfonylureas and the presence of diabetes-related complications.

   CONCLUSIONS: In a nationwide analysis of diabetic Veterans Affairs patients, prescription for metformin was associated with decreased AAA enlargement. These findings provide further support for the conduct of prospective clinical trials to test the ability of metformin to limit progression of early AAA disease.

Abstract
  Although dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-4 inhibitors have been reported to have a neutral effect on thromboembolic vaso-occlusive events in large-scale trials, they act to potentiate several endogenous peptides that can exert deleterious cardiovascular effects. Experimentally, DPP-4 inhibitors may augment the ability of glucagon-like peptide-1 to stimulate cyclic adenosine monophosphate in cardiomyocytes, and potentiation of the effects of stromal cell-derived factor-1 by DPP-4 inhibitors may aggravate cardiac fibrosis. These potentially deleterious actions of DPP-4 inhibitors might not become clinically apparent if these drugs were to promote sodium excretion. However, the natriuretic effect of DPP-4 inhibitors is modest, because they act on the distal (rather than proximal) renal tubules. Accordingly, both clinical trials and observational studies have reported an increase in the risk of heart failure in patients with type 2 diabetes who were receiving DPP-4 inhibitors. This risk may be muted in trials with a high prevalence of metformin use or with low and declining background use of insulin and thiazolidinediones. Still, the most vulnerable patients (i.e., those with established heart failure) were not well represented in these studies. The only trial that specifically evaluated patients with pre-existing left ventricular dysfunction observed important drug-related adverse structural and clinical effects. In conclusion, an increased risk of worsening heart failure appears to be a class effect of DPP-4 inhibitors, even in patients without a history of heart failure. Additional clinical trials are urgently needed to elucidate the benefits and risks of DPP-4 inhibitors in patients with established left ventricular dysfunction.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVES: Safe and easily implemented treatment regimens are needed for the management of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in long-term care (LTC) and skilled nursing facilities.

   DESIGN: This 6-month open-label randomized controlled trial compared the efficacy and safety of a DPP4 inhibitor (linagliptin) and basal insulin (glargine) in LTC residents with T2DM.

   SETTINGS: Three LTC institutions affiliated with a community safety-net hospital, US Department of Veterans Affairs and Emory Healthcare System in Atlanta, Georgia.

   PARTICIPANTS: A total of 140 residents with T2DM treated with oral antidiabetic agents or low-dose insulin (<=0.1 U/kg/d), with fasting or premeal blood glucose (BG) > 180 mg/dL and/or HbA1c >7.5%.

   INTERVENTION: Baseline antidiabetic therapy, except metformin, was discontinued on trial entry. Residents were treated with linagliptin 5 mg/d (n = 67) or glargine at a starting dose of 0.1 U/kg/d (n = 73). Both groups received supplemental rapid-acting insulin before meals for BG > 200 mg/dL.

   MEASUREMENTS: Primary outcome was mean difference in daily BG between groups. Main secondary endpoints included differences in frequency of hypoglycemia, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), complications, emergency department visits, and hospital transfers.

   RESULTS: Treatment with linagliptin resulted in no significant differences in mean daily BG (146 +/- 34 mg/dL vs. 157 +/- 36 mg/dL, P = .07) compared to glargine. Linagliptin treatment resulted in fewer mild hypoglycemic events <70 mg/dL (3% vs. 37%, P < .001), but there were no differences in BG < 54 mg/dL (P = .06) or <40 mg/dL (P = .05) compared to glargine. There were no significant between-group differences in HbA1c, length of stay, complications, emergency department visits, or hospitalizations.

   CONCLUSION: Treatment with linagliptin resulted in noninferior glycemic control and in significantly lower risk of hypoglycemia compared to insulin glargine in long-term care and skilled nursing facility residents with type 2 diabetes.

Abstract
  AIMS: To compare the effects of long-term treatment with the GLP-1RA exenatide twice-daily versus titrated insulin glargine (iGlar) on renal function and albuminuria in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) patients.

   METHODS: We post-hoc evaluated renal outcome-data of 54 overweight T2DM patients (mean +/-SD age 60+/-8years, HbA1c 7.5+/-0.9%, eGFR 86+/-16mL/min/1.73m2, median [IQR] urinary albumin-to-creatinine-ratio (UACR) 0.75 [0.44-1.29]mg/mmol) randomised to exenatide 10microg twice-daily or titrated iGlar on-top-of metformin for 52-weeks. Renal efficacy endpoints were change in creatinine clearance (CrCl) and albuminuria (urinary albumin-excretion [UAE] and UACR) based on 24-h urines, collected at baseline and Week-52. eGFR and exploratory endpoints were collected throughout the intervention-period, and after a 4-week wash-out.

   RESULTS: HbA1c-reductions were similar with exenatide (mean+/-SEM -0.80+/-0.10%) and iGlar (-0.79+/-0.14%; treatment-difference 0.02%; 95% CI -0.31 to 0.42%). Change from baseline to Week-52 in CrCl, UAE or UACR did not statistically differ; only iGlar reduced albuminuria (P<0.05; within-group). eGFR decreased from baseline to Week-4 with exenatide (-3.9+/-2.1mL/min/1.73m2; P=0.069) and iGlar (-2.7+/-1.2mL/min/1.73m2; P=0.034), without treatment-differences in ensuing trajectory. Exenatide versus iGlar reduced bodyweight (-5.4kg; 2.9-7.9; P<0.001), but did not affect blood pressure, lipids or plasma uric acid.

   CONCLUSIONS: Among T2DM patients without overt nephropathy, one-year treatment with exenatide twice-daily does not affect renal function-decline or onset/progression of albuminuria compared to titrated iGlar.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Early treatment intensification leading to sustained good glycaemic control is essential to delay diabetic complications. Although initial combination therapy has been suggested to offer more opportunities than a traditional stepwise approach, its validity remains to be determined.

   METHODS: Vildagliptin Efficacy in combination with metfoRmIn For earlY treatment of type 2 diabetes (VERIFY) was a randomised, double-blind, parallel-group study of newly diagnosed patients with type 2 diabetes conducted in 254 centres across 34 countries. The study consisted of a 2-week screening visit, a 3-week metformin-alone run-in period, and a 5-year treatment period, which was further split into study periods 1, 2, and 3. Patients aged 18-70 years were included if they had type 2 diabetes diagnosed within 2 years prior to enrolment, and centrally confirmed glycated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of 48-58 mmol/mol (6.5-7.5%) and a body-mass index of 22-40 kg/m2. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio either to the early combination treatment group or to the initial metformin monotherapy group, with the help of an interactive response technology system and simple randomisation without stratification. Patients, investigators, clinical staff performing the assessments, and data analysts were masked to treatment allocation. In study period 1, patients received either the early combination treatment with metformin (stable daily dose of 1000 mg, 1500 mg, or 2000 mg) and vildagliptin 50 mg twice daily, or standard-of-care initial metformin monotherapy (stable daily dose of 1000 mg, 1500 mg, or 2000 mg) and placebo twice daily. If the initial treatment did not maintain HbA1c below 53 mmol/mol (7.0%), confirmed at two consecutive scheduled visits which were 13 weeks apart, patients in the metformin monotherapy group received vildagliptin 50 mg twice daily in place of the placebo and entered study period 2, during which all patients received the combination therapy. The primary efficacy endpoint was the time from randomisation to initial treatment failure, defined as HbA1c measurement of at least 53 mmol/mol (7.0%) at two consecutive scheduled visits, 13 weeks apart from randomisation through period 1. The full analysis set included patients who received at least one randomised study medication and had at least one post-randomisation efficacy parameter assessed. The safety analysis set included all patients who received at least one dose of randomised study medication. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01528254.

   FINDINGS: Trial enrolment began on March 30, 2012, and was completed on April 10, 2014. Of the 4524 participants screened, 2001 eligible participants were randomly assigned to either the early combination treatment group (n=998) or the initial metformin monotherapy group (n=1003). A total of 1598 (79.9%) patients completed the 5-year study: 811 (81.3%) in the early combination therapy group and 787 (78.5%) in the monotherapy group. The incidence of initial treatment failure during period 1 was 429 (43.6%) patients in the combination treatment group and 614 (62.1%) patients in the monotherapy group. The median observed time to treatment failure in the monotherapy group was 36.1 (IQR 15.3-not reached [NR]) months, while the median time to treatment failure time for those receiving early combination therapy could only be estimated to be beyond the study duration at 61.9 (29.9-NR) months. A significant reduction in the relative risk for time to initial treatment failure was observed in the early combination treatment group compared with the monotherapy group over the 5-year study duration (hazard ratio 0.51 [95% CI 0.45-0.58]; p<0.0001). Both treatment approaches were safe and well tolerated, with no unexpected or new safety findings, and no deaths related to study treatment.

   INTERPRETATION: Early intervention with a combination therapy of vildagliptin plus metformin provides greater and durable long-term benefits compared with the current standard-of-care initial metformin monotherapy for patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: We examined the effects of metformin on diabetes prevention and the subgroups that benefited most over 15 years in the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) and its follow-up, the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS).

   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: During the DPP (1996-2001), adults at high risk of developing diabetes were randomly assigned to masked placebo (n = 1,082) or metformin 850 mg twice daily (n = 1,073). Participants originally assigned to metformin continued to receive metformin, unmasked, in the DPPOS (2002-present). Ascertainment of diabetes development was based on fasting or 2-h glucose levels after an oral glucose tolerance test or on HbA1c. Reduction in diabetes incidence with metformin was compared with placebo in subgroups by hazard ratio (HR) and rate differences (RDs).

   RESULTS: During 15 years of postrandomization follow-up, metformin reduced the incidence (by HR) of diabetes compared to placebo by 17% or 36% based on glucose or HbA1c levels, respectively. Metformin's effect on the development of glucose-defined diabetes was greater for women with a history of prior gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) (HR 0.59, RD -4.57 cases/100 person-years) compared with parous women without GDM (HR 0.94, RD -0.38 cases/100 person-years [interaction P = 0.03 for HR, P = 0.01 for RD]). Metformin also had greater effects, by HR and RD, at higher baseline fasting glucose levels. With diabetes development based on HbA1c, metformin was more effective in subjects with higher baseline HbA1c by RD, with metformin RD -1.03 cases/100 person-years with baseline HbA1c <6.0% (42 mmol/mol) and -3.88 cases/100 person-years with 6.0-6.4% (P = 0.0001).

   CONCLUSIONS: Metformin reduces the development of diabetes over 15 years. The subsets that benefitted the most include subjects with higher baseline fasting glucose or HbA1c and women with a history of GDM. Copyright © 2019 by the American Diabetes Association.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of IONIS-GCGRRx, a 2'-O-methoxyethyl antisense oligonucleotide targeting the glucagon receptor (GCGR), and the underlying mechanism of liver transaminase increases in patients with type 2 diabetes on stable metformin therapy.

   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In three phase 2, randomized, double-blind studies, patients with type 2 diabetes on metformin received weekly subcutaneous injections of IONIS-GCGRRx (50-200 mg) or placebo for 13 or 26 weeks.

   RESULTS: Significant reductions in HbA1c were observed after IONIS-GCGRRx treatment versus placebo at week 14 (-2.0% 200 mg, -1.4% 100 mg, -0.3% placebo; P < 0.001) or week 27 (-1.6% 75 mg, -0.9% 50 mg, -0.2% placebo; P < 0.001). Dose-dependent increases in transaminases were observed with IONIS-GCGRRx, which were attenuated at lower doses and remained mostly within the normal reference range at the 50-mg dose. There were no other significant safety observations and no symptomatic hypoglycemia or clinically relevant changes in blood pressure, LDL cholesterol, or other vital signs. At week 14, IONIS-GCGRRx 100 mg did not significantly affect mean hepatic glycogen content compared with placebo (15.1 vs. -20.2 mmol/L, respectively; P = 0.093) but significantly increased hepatic lipid content (4.2 vs. -2.7%, respectively; P = 0.005) in the presence of transaminase increases.

   CONCLUSIONS: IONIS-GCGRRx is a potent inhibitor of hepatic glucagon receptor expression with a potential to improve glycemic control at low weekly doses in combination with metformin. Significant reductions in HbA1c occurred across the full-dose range tested, with minimal transaminase elevations at lower doses. Furthermore, novel results suggest that despite inhibition of glycogenolysis after GCGR antagonism, IONIS-GCGRRx did not increase hepatic glycogen content.

Abstract
  AMPK activated protein kinase (AMPK), a master regulator of energy homeostasis, is activated in response to an energy shortage imposed by physical activity and caloric restriction. We here report on the identification of PAN-AMPK activator O304, which - in diet-induced obese mice - increased glucose uptake in skeletal muscle, reduced beta cell stress, and promoted beta cell rest. Accordingly, O304 reduced fasting plasma glucose levels and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) in a proof-of-concept phase IIa clinical trial in type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients on Metformin. T2D is associated with devastating micro- and macrovascular complications, and O304 improved peripheral microvascular perfusion and reduced blood pressure both in animals and T2D patients. Moreover, like exercise, O304 activated AMPK in the heart, increased cardiac glucose uptake, reduced cardiac glycogen levels, and improved left ventricular stroke volume in mice, but it did not increase heart weight in mice or rats. Thus, O304 exhibits a great potential as a novel drug to treat T2D and associated cardiovascular complications.

Abstract
  Semaglutide (Ozempic R) is a new once-weekly agonist of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptors (GLP-1 AR) indicated in the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Phase III clinical trials of the SUSTAIN programme demonstrated both the efficacy and safety of semaglutide in patients with T2D treated by diet and exercise, oral antidiabetic agents or even insulin. Direct and indirect comparative clinical trials showed that semaglutide (subcutaneous 0.5 or 1.0 mg once weekly) exerts a better glucose-lowering activity and a greater weight loss than other GLP-1 AR. Presented as prefilled pens for subcutaneous injection, semaglutide is currently reimbursed in Belgium after failure of antidiabetic therapy including metformin (HbA1c superior to 7,5 % or 58 mmol/mol) in T2D patients with body mass index ? 30 kg/m2.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVES: To provide a meta-analysis of the clinical efficacy and safety of sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2-i), as a combination treatment with metformin in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients with inadequate glycemic control with metformin alone.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: We have searched randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in the database: MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane Collaborative database. We used mean differences (MD) to assess the efficacy of glycemic and other clinical parameters, and risk ratios (RR) to evaluate the adverse events for safety endpoints. The heterogeneity was evaluated by I2.

   RESULTS: Finally 9 studies were included. SGLT2-i plus metformin had higher reduction level in HbA1C [MD = -0.50, 95% CI (-0.62, -0.38), p < 0.00001], FPG [MD = -1.12, 95%CI (-1.38, -0.87), p < 0.00001], body weight [MD = -1.72, 95% CI (-2.05, -1.39), p < 0.00001], SBP [MD = -4.44, 95% CI (-5.45, -3.43), p < 0.00001] and DBP [MD = -1.74, 95% CI (-2.40, -1.07), p < 0.00001] compared with metformin monotherapy. However, SGLT2-i plus metformin group had higher risk of genital infection [RR = 3.98, 95% CI (2.38, 6.67), p < 0.00001]. No significant difference was found in the risk of hypoglycemia, urinary tract infection or volume related adverse events.

   CONCLUSIONS: Although the risk of genital infection may increase, SGLT2-i plus metformin may provide an attractive treatment option to those T2DM patients who are unable to achieve glycemic control with metformin alone, based on its effects on glycemic control, reducing body weight and lowering blood pressure.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: Patients with type 2 diabetes are at risk of microvascular and macrovascular complications. Intensive glycaemic control, especially in patients with short duration of diabetes, is the mainstay of management of type 2 diabetes to lower the risk of complications. However, despite the improvement in the understanding of the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes and development of novel glucose-lowering agents, long-term durable glycaemic control remains a difficult goal to achieve. Several challenging clinical trials proved that an early combination therapy with a variety of glucose-lowering agents had a more favourable effect than conventional stepwise therapy in terms of glycaemic control. We aim to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of a novel, initial triple combination therapy with metformin, sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (dapagliflozin) and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (saxagliptin) compared with conventional stepwise add-on therapy in drug-naive patients with recent-onset type 2 diabetes.

   METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study is a multicentre, prospective, randomised, open-label, parallel group, comparator-controlled trial. A total of 104 eligible participants will be randomised to either the initial combination therapy group or the conventional stepwise add-on therapy group for 104 weeks. The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients who achieved haemoglobin A1c level<6.5% without hypoglycaemia, weight gain or discontinuation due to adverse events at 104 weeks. This trial will determine whether a novel triple combination therapy with metformin, dapagliflozin and saxagliptin has a beneficial effect on durable glycaemic control compared with conventional therapy in drug-naive patients with type 2 diabetes.

   ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study protocol was approved by the local institutional review boards and independent ethics committees over the recruitment sites. Results of this study will be disseminated in scientific journals and scientific conferences.

Abstract
  To investigate whether metformin add-on to the continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (Met + CSII) therapy leads to a significant reduction in insulin doses required by type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients to maintain glycemic control, and an improvement in glycemic variation (GV) compared to CSII only therapy. We analyzed data from our two randomized, controlled open-label trials. Newly diagnoses T2D patients were randomized assigned to receive either CSII therapy or Met + CSII therapy for 4 weeks. Subjects were subjected to a 4-day continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) at the endpoint. Insulin doses and GV profiles were analyzed. The primary endpoint was differences in insulin doses and GV between the two groups. A total of 188 subjects were admitted as inpatients. Subjects in metformin add-on therapy required significantly lower total, basal and bolus insulin doses than those of control group. CGM data showed that patients in Met + CSII group exhibited significant reduction in the 24-hr mean amplitude of glycemic excursions (MAGE), the standard deviation, and the coefficient of variation compared to those of control group. Our data suggest that metformin add-on to CSII therapy leads to a significant reduction in insulin doses required by T2D patients to control glycemic variations.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Teneligliptin is widely prescribed dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (DPP-4i) in India because of its economical pricing. However, there is no headto-head trial comparing teneligliptin with any other DPP-4i in Indian setting. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of teneligliptin versus sitagliptin as add-on to metformin and/or sulfonylureas in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

   METHODS: This prospective, open-label, randomized, active-controlled study enrolled 76 patients (1:1) at 2 centres. Patients received teneligliptin 20 mg or sitagliptin 100 mg orally once daily for 12 weeks as add-on to ongoing metformin or sulfonylurea therapy. Primary endpoint was mean change in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) from baseline at week 12.

   RESULTS: Both arms were comparable (p>0.05) at baseline in terms of age, gender, metformin daily dose, sulfonylurea use, HbA1c, fasting and postprandial blood glucose (FBG and PPBG). At the end of 12 weeks, statistically significant reductions were observed in both teneligliptin and sitagliptin arms in HbA1c (-1.19 +/- 1.16% p<0.0001 and -0.92 +/- 0.95%, p<0.0001), in FBG (-28.3 +/- 63.0 mg/dL, p= 0.01 and -22.9 +/- 47.4 mg/dL, p=0.006) and PPBG (-41.3 +/- 85.4 mg/dL, p=0.006 and -54.7 +/- 85.6 mg/dL, p=0.0005). The reductions in all glycemic parameters were similar between the arms. Both gliptins were well-tolerated with no difference in the number of adverse events. There was no change in QT/QTc intervals or other ECG parameters at week 12 in both arms. In post-hoc comparison, percentage of patients achieving target HbA1c <7% (as per American Diabetes Association guidelines) at week 12 favored teneligliptin arm over sitagliptin arm (33.3% vs. 19.4% patients).

   CONCLUSION: Teneligliptin provided similar glycemic control as compared to sitagliptin and reduced HbA1c, FBG and PPBG values significantly within 12 weeks of treatment. Both gliptins were found to be safe and well-tolerated in Indian patients with T2DM. Copyright © Journal of the Association of Physicians of India 2011.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: There is a conflicting literature on the association between the use of antihyperglycemic drugs and dementia risk.

   OBJECTIVE: The goal of this case-control study was to analyze the association between the use of antihyperglycemic drugs and dementia risk in patients followed in general practices in Germany.

   METHODS: This study included patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who had received a first dementia diagnosis in 972 general practices in Germany between January 2013 and December 2017 (index date). Controls without dementia were matched (1:1) to cases by age, gender, index year, and physician. Two multivariate regression models were used to study the association between the use of antihyperglycemic drugs and dementia risk. Model 1 included all antihyperglycemic drugs prescribed to patients regardless of the prescription duration, whereas Model 2 only included the longest therapy prescribed to each patient.

   RESULTS: There were 8,276 diabetes patients with dementia and 8,276 diabetes patients without dementia included in this study. In Model 1, glitazones were associated with a decreased dementia risk (odds ratio [OR] = 0.80), whereas insulin was associated with an increased risk of developing the condition (OR = 1.34). In Model 2, metformin, prescribed as monotherapy (OR = 0.71) or as dual therapy with sulfonylureas (OR = 0.90), was associated with a decrease in the likelihood of subsequently being diagnosed with dementia. By contrast, the combination of basal insulin and bolus insulin (OR = 1.47) and premix insulin (OR = 1.33) were risk factors for dementia.

   CONCLUSION: Metformin and glitazones were negatively associated with dementia, while insulin was positively associated with dementia.

Abstract
  Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems allow patients with diabetes mellitus to closely track glucose concentrations over several days, identify trends in glucose levels, and avoid glucose excursions. This technology has not only advanced diabetes mellitus management but has increased patient safety through greater glycemic awareness. Due to these attributes, CGM is now being applied in therapeutic research as a pharmacodynamic tool to support early clinical drug development programs. However, to date only a handful of studies have utilized CGM in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) drug development. A potential barrier from fostering greater use of CGM in clinical development may be related to concerns over subject variability. Therefore, we investigated a key consideration when implementing CGM into early clinical research studies: daily variation within patients with T2DM from multiple clinical research units. From 24 patients with T2DM, we observed strong daily reproducibility (Pearson R = 0.86, P < .0001) in CGM results and found that this technique is practical for multisite studies. Altogether, with low daily variability, CGM is a powerful pharmacodynamic tool for drug efficacy and safety monitoring. Copyright © 2018, The Authors.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To study the efficacy of oral vitamin D in improving glycaemic control of patients with type 2 diabetes by reducing glycated haemoglobin levels.

   METHODS: This randomised control trial was carried out at Mayo Hospital, Lahore, from February 5 to August 5, 2016, and comprised type 2 diabetes patients aged 40-70 years visiting the outpatient clinics. They were randomly divided into two groups by using the lottery method. Group A received oral vitamin D along with metformin and group B received metformin only. Blood samples of both the groups were tested for glycated haemoglobin at three months to assess the change. SPSS 21 was used for data analysis.

   RESULTS: There were 140 patients divided into two groups of 70(50%) each. Mean age in Group A was 54.80+/-8.55 years and 58.40+/-7.98 years in Group B. No significant difference was seen in glycated haemoglobin levels at baseline (p>0.05). However, after 3 months post-treatment the levels significantly differed (p<0.05) in favour of Group A.

   CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D supplementation had a significant effect in lowering glycated haemoglobin level in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: Treatment intensification with additional anti-diabetic agents is recommended in type 2 diabetes (T2D) for patients inadequately controlled on metformin monotherapy. The present network meta-analysis (NMA) evaluated comparative efficacy and safety of once-weekly semaglutide and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is) in T2D patients inadequately controlled with metformin.

   METHODS: Randomized controlled trials with >=20 weeks duration were searched in EMBASE, MEDLINE, and CENTRAL. Primary efficacy outcomes were: change from baseline in HbA1c, weight, systolic blood pressure (SBP), post-prandial blood glucose (PPG), and fasting blood glucose (FPG). Treatment effects at 26 (+/-4) weeks were compared using Bayesian NMAs. Meta-regression and sensitivity analysis were used to address the trial heterogeneity.

   RESULTS: Eight trials were found eligible for this NMA. Statistically significant reductions in HbA1c were observed with both 1.0 mg and 0.5 mg doses of once-weekly semaglutide when compared to SGLT-2is. The mean differences in change from baseline in HbA1c for once-weekly semaglutide 1.0 mg vs SGLT-2is ranged from -0.66% for canagliflozin 300 mg (95% Credible Intervals [CrI]: -0.82, -0.50%) to -1.11% for dapagliflozin 5 mg (95% CrI: -1.37, -0.85%). Once-weekly semaglutide 1.0 mg performed significantly better than all SGLT-2is of interest in reducing weight and improving FPG levels: however, SBP reduction was not statistically differentiable. Results of sensitivity analysis and meta-regressions aligned with base-case results. NMAs were not possible for PPG and safety outcomes, due to lack of data.

   CONCLUSION: Once-weekly semaglutide treatment is significantly better compared to SGLT-2is in achieving adequate glycemic control in T2D patients inadequately controlled with metformin monotherapy.

Abstract
  Metformin (MET) has possibilities to be utilized as an adjunct of tuberculosis (TB) therapy for controlling the growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis). MET enhances the production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and facilitates phagosome-lysosome fusion; those mechanism are important in M. tuberculosis elimination. Moreover, MET-associated lactic acidosis (MALA) needs to be considered and the incidence of MALA in patients with type 2 DM-TB coinfection remains unknown. This result contributes much to our understanding about the clinical effect of MET use in type 2 DM-TB coinfection. For the purpose of understanding the MET effect as an adjuvant therapy in TB therapy and insulin simultaneous therapy, an observational clinical study was done in type 2 DM newly TB coinfection outpatients at Surabaya Paru Hospital. Patients were divided into two groups. First group was MET group, in which the patients were given MET accompanying insulin and TB treatment regimens, the golden standard therapy of DM-TB coinfection. MET therapy was given for at least 2 months. Second group was non-MET group, in which the patients were given insulin and TB treatment regimens. The lactate levels in both groups were measured after 2 months. Among 42 participants, there was no case of lactic acidosis during this study period. Data were normally distributed; thus, we continued analysis of the difference using paired T-test with 95% confidence. There was no difference in lactate levels (p=0.396) after MET therapy compared to non-MET group. In this study involving patients with TB pulmonary diseases, there is neither evidence that MET therapy induced lactic acidosis event nor that it increased lactate blood level. Thus, we concluded that MET use in type 2 DM-TB coinfection did not induce lactic acidosis. Copyright © 2017 Tuberculosis Association of India. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  AIMS/INTRODUCTION: The present study investigated the effect of high-dose metformin or low-dose metformin/linagliptin combination therapy on glycemic variability (GV) in type 2 diabetes patients with insufficient glycemic control despite low-dose metformin monotherapy in a cross-over study using continuous glucose monitoring.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present study was carried out with 11 type 2 diabetes outpatients (7% < glycated hemoglobin < 10%) receiving low-dose metformin monotherapy (500-1,000 mg). All patients were assigned to either metformin 1,500 mg monotherapy (HMET) or combination therapy of low-dose (750 mg) metformin and linagliptin 5 mg (LMET + dipeptidyl peptidase-4 [DPP4]). GV was evaluated by continuous glucose monitoring after >4 weeks of the initial treatment and again after cross-over to the other treatment. GV metrics were compared between the treatments using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.

   RESULTS: Of the continuous glucose monitoring-derived GV metrics for the HMET versus LMET + DPP4, mean glucose levels, standard deviations and mean amplitude of glucose excursions were not significantly different. Although the pre-breakfast glucose levels were not significantly different among the treatments (P = 0.248), the 3-h postprandial glucose area under the curve (>160 mg/dL) after breakfast was significantly larger with HMET versus LMET + DPP4 (9,550 [2,075-11,395] vs 4,065 [1,950-8,895]; P = 0.041).

   CONCLUSIONS: A comparison of GV with HMET versus LMET + DPP4 suggested that LMET + DPP4 might reduce post-breakfast GV to a greater degree than HMET in type 2 diabetes patients receiving low-dose metformin monotherapy.

Abstract
  AIMS/INTRODUCTION: The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of metformin and a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, alogliptin, on body composition in a 12-week randomized add-on trial in Japanese participants with type 2 diabetes.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 84 participants with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes undergoing antidiabetic therapy were randomly assigned to receive alogliptin (25 mg, once daily) or metformin (1,000 mg, twice daily) for 12 weeks. The primary efficacy end-point was body composition. The secondary end-points included factors associated with decreased bodyweight.

   RESULTS: Compared with the baseline values, alogliptin significantly increased bodyweight (66.5 +/- 19.2 to 67.6 +/- 19.3 kg), body mass index (BMI; 25.4 +/- 6.1 to 25.8 +/- 6.3 kg/m2 ) and fat mass (20.3 +/- 12.8 to 21.8 +/- 14.5 kg), whereas metformin had no significant effect on body composition. Alogliptin was inferior to metformin in reducing bodyweight (0.84 +/- 1.57 vs -0.35 +/- 1.53 kg, P = 0.002), BMI (0.34 +/- 0.69 to -0.15 +/- 0.56 kg/m2 , P = 0.002) and fat mass (1.49 +/- 5.06 vs -0.04 +/- 1.81 kg, P = 0.042). BMI at baseline was associated with changes in bodyweight negatively in the metformin group and positively in the alogliptin group.

   CONCLUSIONS: Metformin and alogliptin exert opposite effects on bodyweight in type 2 diabetes patients who are overweight. The higher the BMI, the more metformin reduces bodyweight and alogliptin increases weight. Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: Treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in children and adolescents is particularly challenging. Metformin monotherapy is the standard initial treatment for youth with T2D, once metabolic control is restored with insulin in patients who present with ketosis and/or marked hyperglycemia. Insulin, the only other drug approved for use in youth with T2D, is also used as add-on therapy when patients fail metformin mono-therapy.

   AREAS COVERED: In this paper, we will summarize the current use of both metformin and insulin in the treatment of pediatric type 2 diabetes, as well as comment on their limitations. Given the rapid progression of T2D in youth, there is also considerable interest in treating youth with new oral and injectable agents that have been approved for use in adults with T2D. The potential for improving clinical outcomes of each of the main classes of new drugs for the treatment of pediatric T2D will be summerized.

   EXPERT COMMENTARY: We will conclude by reviewing why phase 3 randomized clinical trials examining the safety and efficacy of these medications in the pediatric population have been difficult to complete and discuss a potential pathway to overcome these obstacles to regulatory approval for these drugs for adolescents with T2D.

Abstract
  Importance: Because of the substantial increase in the occurrence of type 2 diabetes in the pediatric population and the medical complications of this condition, therapies are urgently needed that will achieve better glycemic control than standard medical management.

   Objective: To compare glycemic control in cohorts of severely obese adolescents with type 2 diabetes undergoing medical and surgical interventions.

   Design, Setting, and Participants: A secondary analysis of data collected by the Teen-Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery (Teen-LABS) and Treatment Options of Type 2 Diabetes in Adolescents and Youth (TODAY) consortia was performed. Teen-LABS enrolled 242 adolescents (<=19 years of age) from March 1, 2007, through December 31, 2011. TODAY randomized 699 participants (aged 10-17 years) from July 24, 2004, through February 25, 2009. Data analysis was performed from July 6, 2015, to June 24, 2017. Anthropometric, clinical, and laboratory data from adolescents with severe obesity and type 2 diabetes who underwent treatment with metabolic or bariatric surgery in the Teen-LABS study or medical therapy in the TODAY study were compared.

   Interventions: Teen-LABS participants underwent a primary bariatric surgical procedure; TODAY participants were randomized to receive metformin therapy alone or in combination with rosiglitazone or an intensive lifestyle intervention; insulin therapy was given in cases of progression of disease.

   Main Outcomes and Measures: Glycemic control, body mass index, prevalence of elevated blood pressure, dyslipidemia, abnormal kidney function, and clinical adverse events were measured.

   Results: Data from 30 participants from Teen-LABS (mean [SD] age at baseline, 16.9 [1.3] years; 21 [70%] female; 18 [66%] white) and 63 from TODAY (mean [SD] age at baseline, 15.3 [1.3] years; 28 [44%] female; 45 [71%] white) were analyzed. During 2 years, mean hemoglobin A1c concentration decreased from 6.8% (95% CI, 6.4%-7.3%) to 5.5% (95% CI, 4.7% -6.3%) in Teen-LABS and increased from 6.4% (95% CI, 6.1%-6.7%) to 7.8% (95% CI, 7.2%-8.3%) in TODAY. Compared with baseline, the body mass index decreased by 29% (95% CI, 24%-34%) in Teen-LABS and increased by 3.7% (95% CI, 0.8%-6.7%) in TODAY. Twenty-three percent of Teen-LABS participants required a subsequent operation during the 2-year follow-up.

   Conclusions and Relevance: Compared with medical therapy, surgical treatment of severely obese adolescents with type 2 diabetes was associated with better glycemic control, reduced weight, and improvement of other comorbidities. These data support the need for a well-designed, prospective controlled study to define the role of surgery for adolescents with type 2 diabetes, including health and surgical outcomes.

Abstract
  Purpose: AMD is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in older individuals in the Western world, and there are currently no therapies to halt disease progression. Studies suggest that the commonly prescribed antidiabetic drug, metformin, is associated with decreased risk of several ocular diseases, but no work has investigated the effect of metformin use on development of AMD. Thus, we aim to investigate whether metformin use is associated with decreased risk of developing AMD.

   Methods: In this retrospective case-control study, we used medical records from patients older than 55 who have visited a University of Florida health clinic. Three controls were matched for every AMD case, defined by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision code, based on the Charlson Comorbidity Index to ensure comparable baseline overall health status. Univariate and conditional multivariable logistic regressions were used to determine the association between a variety of covariates, including metformin use, and AMD diagnosis.

   Results: Metformin use was associated with decreased odds of developing AMD, independently of the other covariates investigated, with an odds ratio of 0.58 and a 95% confidence interval of 0.43 to 0.79. Other medications assessed were not associated with decreased odds of developing AMD.

   Conclusions: Patients who had taken metformin had decreased odds of developing AMD, suggesting that metformin may have a therapeutic role in AMD development or progression in those who are at risk. Further work should include clinical trials to investigate prospectively whether metformin has a protective effect in those at risk for developing AMD.

Abstract
  Type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic non-communicable disease due to abnormal insulin actions causing uncontrolled hyperglycaemia. The treatment for T2DM, for instance, metformin and incretin mimetic, mainly focuses on the restoration of insulin sensitivity and secretion. Exendin-4 is a short incretin-mimetic peptide consisting of 39 amino acids. It is discovered in the venom of Heloderma suspectum as a full agonist for the glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor and produces insulinotropic effects. It is more resistant to enzymatic degradation by dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 and has a longer half-life than the endogenous GLP-1; thus, it is further developed as an incretin hormone analogue used to treat T2DM. The helical region of the peptide first interacts with the extracellular N-terminal domain (NTD) of GLP-1 receptor while the C-terminal extension containing the tryptophan cage further enhances its binding affinity. After binding to the NTD of the receptor, it may cause the receptor to switch from its auto-inhibited state of the receptor to its auto-activated state. Exendin-4 enhances the physiological functions of beta-cells and the up-regulation of GLP-1 receptors, thus reducing the plasma glucose levels. Moreover, exendin-4 has also been found to ameliorate neuropathy, nephropathy and ventricular remodelling. The therapeutic effects of exendin-4 have also been extrapolated into several clinical trials. Although exendin-4 has a reasonable subcutaneous bioavailability, its half-life is rather short. Therefore, several modifications have been undertaken to improve its pharmacokinetics and insulinotropic potency. This review focuses on the pharmacology of exendin-4 and the structure-function relationships of exendin-4 with GLP-1 receptor. The review also highlights some challenges and future directions in the improvement of exendin-4 as an anti-diabetic drug.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Metformin and the sulfonylureas are common initial antidiabetic agents; the former has demonstrated anti-TB action in in vitro and animal studies. The comparative effect of metformin vs the sulfonylureas on TB risk in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) remains unclear.

   METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, patients without chronic kidney disease who received a T2DM diagnosis during 2003 to 2013 were identified from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. Participants with >= 2 years of follow-up were reviewed and observed for TB until December 2013. Patients receiving metformin >= 60 cumulative defined daily dose (cDDD) and sulfonylureas < 15 cDDD in the initial 2 years were defined as metformin majors; it was the inverse for sulfonylurea majors. The two groups were matched 1:1 by propensity score and compared for TB risk by multivariate Cox regression analysis.

   RESULTS: Among 40,179 patients with T2DM, 263 acquired TB (0.65%) over a mean follow-up of 6.1 years. In multivariate analysis, the initial 2-year dosage of metformin, but not that of the sulfonylureas, was an independent predictor of TB (60-cDDD increase (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.931; 95% CI, 0.877-0.990) after adjustment by cofactors, including adapted diabetes complication severity index. Metformin majors had a significantly lower TB risk than that of sulfonylurea majors before and after matching (HR, 0.477; 95% CI, 0.268-0.850 and HR, 0.337; 95% CI, 0.169-0.673; matched pairs, n = 3,161). Compared with the reference group (initial 2-year metformin < 60 cDDD), metformin treatment showed a dose-dependent association with TB risk (60-219 cDDD; HR, 0.860; 95% CI, 0.637-1.161; 220-479 cDDD, HR, 0.706; 95% CI, 0.485-1.028; >= 480 cDDD, HR, 0.319; 95% CI, 0.118-0.863).

   CONCLUSIONS: Metformin use in the initial 2 years was associated with a decreased risk of TB, and metformin users had a reduced risk compared with their sulfonylurea comparators. Copyright © 2017 American College of Chest Physicians. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  Objective: In early type 2 diabetes (T2DM), the administration of short-term intensive insulin therapy (IIT) can induce glycemic remission for a year thereafter, but this effect ultimately wanes. In this context, intermittently repeating short-term IIT could provide a strategy for maintaining the otherwise transient benefits of this intervention. However, the viability of this strategy would be contingent upon not inducing undesirable effects of insulin therapy such as excessive hypoglycemia and fat deposition. We thus sought to evaluate the effect of administering short-term IIT every 3 months on hypoglycemia, weight gain, and quality of life in early T2DM. Methods: In this 2-year pilot trial, 24 adults with T2DM of 2.0 +/- 1.7 years duration and hemoglobin A1c of 6.4 (46 mmol/mol) +/- 0.1% were randomized to 3 weeks of IIT (glargine, lispro) followed by either (1), repeat IIT for up to 2 weeks every 3 months or (2), daily metformin. IIT was titrated to target near-normoglycemia (premeal glucose 4 to 6 mmol/L; 2-hour postmeal <8 mmol/L). Participants were assessed every 3 months, with quality of life (QOL) evaluated annually. Results: The rate of hypoglycemia (<3.5 mmol/L) was low in the metformin and intermittent IIT arms (0.37 versus 0.95 events per patient-year; P = .28). There were no differences between the groups in changes over time in overall, central, or hepatic fat deposition (as reflected by weight [P = .10], waist-to-hip ratio [P = .58], and alanine aminotransferase [P = .64], respectively). Moreover, there were no differences between the groups in QOL at 1- and 2-years. Conclusion:  Intermittent short-term IIT may be safely administered in early T2DM without excessive adverse impact on hypoglycemic risk, anthropometry, or QOL.

Abstract
  AIM: Strict blood glucose control in the treatment of diabetes can sometimes lead to hypoglycemia. The main aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of hypoglycemia among patients receiving sulfonylureas alone, or in combination with metformin, for the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) in Argentina.

   METHODS: This is a real life, multi-center, retrospective, and cross-sectional study based on clinical chart reviews including cross-sectional data, and evaluation of patient questionnaires of T2DM patients (>30 years), treated with sulfonylureas alone or in combination with metformin, during a routine clinic visit in 16 medical centers across Argentina. Socio-demographic and clinical parameters were collected from medical records, as well as hypoglycemic events from both the medical records and the patient questionnaires. The glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels were obtained from medical records as well as a blood test.

   RESULTS: The study included a total of 397 patients with a mean age of 62.5 years, diagnosed for 9.9 years, and 54.2% male. Mean HbA1c levels were 8.1%, (65mmol/mol) at enrolment, with 36.4% being in control (HbA1c<7%, (53mmol/mol). Patients with HbA1c<7%, (53mmol/mol) were significantly older, diagnosed at older age, and had lower triglyceride levels. Almost 50% reported hypoglycemic episodes that were mostly mild, and with women more likely to report them. The large majority (86%) were on combined metformin and sulfonylureas, most commonly Glibenclamide (48.6%). Patients on combined therapy were significantly younger and more likely to have uncontrolled diabetes.

   CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that out of a sample of 397 patients with T2DM treated with sulfonylureas alone or in combination with metformin in Argentina, around 50% of them reported symptoms of hypoglycemia induced by sulfonylureas, and one third of them achieved target HbA1c<7% levels.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Diabetes increases the risk for cardiovascular (CV) events. It has recently been shown that the use of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors leads to a reduction in CV outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), including mortality and heart failure hospitalization. The exact mechanisms of how SGLT2 inhibitors lead to this CV risk reduction remain incompletely understood. The study of DAPAgliflozin on CARDiac substrate uptake, myocardial efficiency and myocardial contractile work in type 2 diabetes patients (DAPACARD) (NCT03387683) explores the possible effects of dapagliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor, on cardiac work, metabolism, and biomarker levels.

   METHODS: DAPACARD is an international, randomized, double-blind trial that aims to examine the effects of dapagliflozin versus matching placebo in 52 patients with T2DM that are on stable metformin therapy prior to and during the 6 weeks of treatment. The primary efficacy endpoint is change in global longitudinal strain of the left ventricle (GLSLV) measured with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) between baseline (pre-treatment) and end of study (on-treatment). The secondary endpoint is the corresponding change in myocardial efficiency measured as external left ventricular work divided by total left ventricular work, which is estimated using [11C]-acetate clearance using positron emission tomography (PET).

   CONCLUSION: The DAPACARD study is an extensive investigation of cardiac function and metabolism, by advanced imaging with PET and MRI, as well as biomarkers, performed in order to further explore how the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin could influence cardiovascular outcomes in patients with T2DM.

Abstract
  Importance: Results of clinical trials suggest that canagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor for treating type 2 diabetes, may be associated with lower extremity amputation.

   Objective: To quantify the association between the use of oral medication for type 2 diabetes and 5 outcomes (lower extremity amputation, peripheral arterial disease, critical limb ischemia, osteomyelitis, and ulcer).

   Design, Setting, and Participants: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using Truven Health MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters data on new users between September 1, 2012, and September 30, 2015. The study focused on 2.0 million commercially insured individuals and used propensity score weighting to balance baseline differences among groups. Sensitivity analyses varied statistical models, assessed the effect of combining dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) agonists as a single referent group, adjusted for baseline use of older oral agents, and included people with baseline amputation.

   Exposures: New use of SGLT-2 inhibitors alone, DPP-4 inhibitors alone, GLP-1 agonists alone, or other antidiabetic agents (sulfonylurea, metformin hydrochloride, or thiazolidinediones).

   Main Outcomes and Measures: Foot and leg amputation, defined by validated International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision and Current Procedural Terminology codes.

   Results: Among 2.0 million potentially eligible individuals, a total of 953906 (516046 women and 437860 men; mean [SD] age, 51.8 [10.9] years) were included in the final analyses, including 39869 new users of SGLT-2 inhibitors (4.2%), 105023 new users of DPP-4 inhibitors (11.0%), and 39120 new users of GLP-1 agonists (4.1%). The median observation time ranged from 99 days for new users of GLP-1 agonists to 127 days for those using metformin, sulfonylureas, and thiazolidinediones, while the crude incident rates ranged from 4.90 per 10000 person-years for those using metformin, sulfonylureas, and thiazolidinediones to 10.53 per 10000 person-years for new users of SGLT-2 inhibitors. After propensity score weighting and adjustment for demographics, severity of diabetes, comorbidities, and medications, there was a nonstatistically significant increased risk of amputation associated with new use of SGLT-2 inhibitors compared with DPP-4 inhibitors (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.50; 95% CI, 0.85-2.67) and GLP-1 agonists (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.47; 95% CI, 0.64-3.36). New use of SGLT-2 inhibitors was statistically significantly associated with amputation compared with sulfonylureas, metformin, or thiazolidinediones (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.12; 95% CI, 1.19-3.77). These results persisted in sensitivity analyses.

   Conclusions and Relevance: Use of SGLT-2 inhibitors may be associated with increased risk of amputation compared with some oral treatments for type 2 diabetes. Further observational studies are needed with extended follow-up and larger sample sizes.

Abstract
  To improve understanding of the safety and efficacy of adding sitagliptin to treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes taking premixed insulin, data from patients using premixed insulin +/- metformin (screening HbA1c >=7.5% and <=11%) in either of two clinical trials in which sitagliptin 100 mg once-daily or placebo was added to various formulations of insulin treatment, were analysed. In both trials, insulin doses were to remain stable throughout the 24-week trial period. At week 24, the between-group difference (sitagliptin - placebo) in the least squares mean (95% confidence intervals) change from baseline in HbA1c in patients using premixed insulin was -0.43% (-0.58, -0.28), P <0.001. Adverse events were generally similar between the treatment groups. The incidence of symptomatic hypoglycaemia was slightly higher with sitagliptin, and the incidence of hypoglycaemia requiring medical attention was slightly higher with placebo; in both cases the difference was not statistically significant. The data from this pooled analysis confirm the utility of sitagliptin used in combination with premixed insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes. Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Abstract
  Produced as a tissue defence response to hypoxia and inflammation, growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15) is elevated in people receiving metformin treatment. To gain insight into the relationship of GDF-15 with metformin and major cardiovascular risk factors, we analysed the data from the SUMMIT cohort (n = 1438), a four-centre, nested, case-control study aimed at verifying whether biomarkers of atherosclerosis differ according to the presence of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. While in univariate analysis, major cardiovascular risk factors, with the exception of gender and cholesterol, increased similarly and linearly across GDF-15 quartiles, the independent variables associated with GDF-15, both in participants with and without diabetes, were age, plasma creatinine, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, diuretic use, smoking exposure and glycated haemoglobin. In participants with diabetes, metformin treatment was associated with a 40% rise in GDF-15 level, which was independent of the other major factors, and largely explained their elevated GDF-15 levels. The relatively high GDF-15 bioavailability might partly explain the protective cardiovascular effects of metformin. Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Abstract
  AIM: To compare the efficacy and safety of once-weekly dulaglutide with that of insulin glargine in combination with metformin and/or a sulphonylurea in mainly Asian patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this 52-week, randomized, parallel-arm open-label study, we enrolled patients aged >=18 years with T2DM for at least 6 months and a glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) concentration >=53.0 mmol/mol (7.0%) and <=96.7 mmol/mol (11.0%). The primary outcome was change in HbA1c from baseline to week 26 to determine non-inferiority of dulaglutide 1.5 mg versus glargine.

   RESULTS: A total of 774 patients from China, South Korea, Mexico and Russia were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to dulaglutide 1.5 mg, dulaglutide 0.75 mg or glargine treatment groups. The patients' mean age was 55 years and the average T2DM duration was ~8 years. The least squares mean (SE) changes from baseline in HbA1c at 26 weeks were - 18.9 (0.73) mmol/mol (-1.73 [0.067]%) for dulaglutide 1.5 mg and -14.5 (0.73) mmol/mol (-1.33 [0.067]%) for dulaglutide 0.75 mg, compared with -12.7 (0.73) mmol/mol (-1.16 [0.067]%) for glargine. Statistical criteria for superiority were met with both dulaglutide 1.5 mg and dulaglutide 0.75 mg. More patients in the dulaglutide 1.5 and 0.75 mg groups achieved HbA1c target <53.0 mmol/mol (<7.0%) than in the glargine group at week 26 (P < 0.001 and P = 0.004, respectively). Body weight decreased with dulaglutide and increased with glargine. The incidence and rate of total hypoglycaemia were lower with dulaglutide versus glargine. Gastrointestinal adverse events, including diarrhoea and nausea, were the most frequently reported for patients taking dulaglutide.

   CONCLUSIONS: Once-weekly dulaglutide provides greater improvement in HbA1c, with weight loss and less hypoglycaemia, than once-daily insulin glargine in a population of mainly Asian patients with T2DM who had failed to achieve optimal glycaemic control on metformin and/or a sulphonylurea.

Abstract
  Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic, progressive disease characterized by persistently elevated blood glucose concentration (hyperglycemia). We developed a mechanistic drug-disease modeling platform based on data from more than 4,000 T2DM subjects in seven phase II/III clinical trials. The model integrates longitudinal changes in clinically relevant biomarkers of glycemic control with information on baseline disease state, demographics, disease progression, and different therapeutic interventions, either when given alone or as add-on combination therapy. The model was able to simultaneously characterize changes in fasting plasma glucose, fasting serum insulin, and glycated hemoglobin A1c following administration of sulfonylurea, metformin, and thiazolidinedione as well as disease progression in clinical trials ranging from 16-104 weeks of treatment. The mechanistic components of this generalized mechanism-based platform, based on knowledge of pharmacology, insulin-glucose homeostatic feedback, and diabetes pathophysiology, allows its application to be further expanded to other antidiabetic drug classes and combination therapies.

Abstract
  PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The current approach to diabetes in the elderly incorporates components from the comprehensive geriatric approach. The most updated guidelines from the American Diabetes Association reflect influence from the consensus made in 2012 with the American Geriatrics Society. Notably, the framework included the evaluation for geriatric syndromes (falls and urinary incontinence), functional and cognitive abilities. The goal for this review is to provide an updated summary of treatment strategies for community-dwelling older adults. We identified the need to expand our approach by addressing innovative approaches and scientific concepts from telemedicine, functional medicine, and geriatrics.

   RECENT FINDINGS: Findings on cardiovascular protection with sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i) and some glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) support their use for older patients with diabetes. However, careful consideration for agent selection must incorporate the presence of geriatric issues, such as geriatric syndromes, or functional and cognitive decline, as they could increase the risk and impact adverse reactions. Telemedicine interventions can improve communication and connection between older patients and their providers, and improve glycemic control. Functional medicine concepts can offer additional adjuvant strategies to support the therapeutic interventions and management of diabetes in the elderly. A systematic review confirmed the efficacy and safety of metformin as first-line therapy of type 2 diabetes in the older adult, but multiple reports highlighted the risk for vitamin B12 deficiency. Randomized controlled trials showed the efficacy and safety of antihyperglycemic agents in the elderly, including some with longer duration and lesser risk for hypoglycemia. Randomized clinical trials showed cardiovascular protection with SGLT-2i (empagliflozin, canagliflozin) and GLP-1RA (liraglutide, semaglutide). The most current guidelines recommend addressing for geriatric syndromes, physical and cognitive function in the elderly, in order to individualize targets and therapeutic strategies. Clinicians managing diabetes in the elderly can play a major role for the early detection and evaluation of geriatric issues in their patients. Telemedicine interventions improve glycemic control, and certain functional medicine strategies could be adjuvant interventions to reduce inflammation and stress, but more studies focused on the elderly population are needed.

Abstract
  PURPOSE OF REVIEW: With recent cardiovascular outcome trial (CVOT) results for antihyperglycemic medications, the treatment algorithm for patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and atherosclerotic vascular disease (ASCVD) requires revision.

   RECENT FINDINGS: All completed CVOTs have demonstrated CV safety of the tested medications, with some trials demonstrating CV efficacy. While metformin remains the first-line recommended medication for T2DM, 18-37% of the patients enrolled in the completed CVOTs were not treated with metformin, providing substantial power to assess CV outcomes independent of metformin. The safety and tolerability of metformin are indisputable, but there are no robust data proving its efficacy for either macro or microvascular disease outcomes. We should reconsider the primacy of metformin in the management of T2DM in patients with ASCVD. This article will review the evidence for CV effects of antihyperglycemic agents (AHAs), and propose an evidence-based treatment algorithm for patients with T2DM and ASCVD.

Abstract
  Heart failure is one of the most common comorbidities of diabetes mellitus. Glucose-lowering therapies that can prevent heart failure or improve outcomes in patients with established heart failure are of critical importance among those with type 2 diabetes. Several types of glucose-lowering drugs have been assessed in this setting. Metformin has been shown to modestly improve the outcomes of patients with heart failure, whereas the effect of insulin in those with established heart failure is less clear. The effect of sulfonylureas on improving heart failure is controversial; observational reports have suggested that they are harmful in these patients, but these data have not been confirmed in randomized, controlled trials. Thiazolidinediones are contraindicated in patients with established heart failure and have also been known to cause heart failure. Furthermore, certain dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors seem to increase heart failure hospitalization. The effects of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists might differ in patients with or without established heart failure, particularly those with decompensated heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction. However, perhaps the most important finding has been that sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2; also known as SLC5A2) inhibitors reduce heart failure hospitalizations and, in the case of empagliflozin, markedly reduce the rate of cardiovascular death. Given the known neutral (or even harmful) effects of other glucose-lowering drugs on heart failure outcomes, SGLT2 inhibitors might well be considered the drug class of choice in patients with diabetes and heart failure, or in those at high risk of developing heart failure.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: Two 52-week Phase III studies evaluated the efficacy and safety of once-daily combinations of empagliflozin/linagliptin as monotherapy or add-on to metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). The aim of this analysis was to further assess the safety and tolerability of empagliflozin/linagliptin compared with their individual components in patients with T2DM, using pooled data from these trials.

   METHODS: A total of 1363 patients were treated with empagliflozin 25 mg/linagliptin 5 mg (n = 273), empagliflozin 10 mg/linagliptin 5 mg (n = 272), empagliflozin 25 mg (n = 276), empagliflozin 10 mg (n = 275), or linagliptin 5 mg (n = 267). Adverse events (AEs) were assessed descriptively in patients who took >= 1 dose of study drug.

   RESULTS: Total exposure was 251, 255, 256, 249, and 243 patient-years in the empagliflozin 25 mg/linagliptin 5 mg, empagliflozin 10 mg/linagliptin 5 mg, empagliflozin 25 mg, empagliflozin 10 mg, and linagliptin 5 mg groups, respectively. The proportion of patients with >= 1 AE was similar across groups (70.4-74.9%). The percentage of patients with confirmed hypoglycemic AEs (plasma glucose <= 70 mg/dL and/or requiring assistance) was low in all groups (1.1-2.2%); none required assistance. Events consistent with urinary tract infection were reported in similar percentages of patients in all groups (11.4-13.8%), and in a greater proportion of female than male patients. Events consistent with genital infection were reported in higher percentages of patients on empagliflozin/linagliptin or empagliflozin (4.0-6.5%) than linagliptin 5 mg (2.6%), and in a greater proportion of females than males. The risks of hypersensitivity reactions and events consistent with volume depletion were low across treatment groups.

   CONCLUSION: Empagliflozin/linagliptin as monotherapy or add-on to metformin for 52 weeks was well tolerated in patients with T2DM, with safety profiles similar to individual components, including a low risk of hypoglycemia.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Metformin is the regulatory-approved treatment of choice for most youth with type 2 diabetes early in the disease. However, early loss of glycemic control has been observed with metformin monotherapy. Whether liraglutide added to metformin (with or without basal insulin treatment) is safe and effective in youth with type 2 diabetes is unknown.

   METHODS: Patients who were 10 to less than 17 years of age were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive subcutaneous liraglutide (up to 1.8 mg per day) or placebo for a 26-week double-blind period, followed by a 26-week open-label extension period. Inclusion criteria were a body-mass index greater than the 85th percentile and a glycated hemoglobin level between 7.0 and 11.0% if the patients were being treated with diet and exercise alone or between 6.5 and 11.0% if they were being treated with metformin (with or without insulin). All the patients received metformin during the trial. The primary end point was the change from baseline in the glycated hemoglobin level after 26 weeks. Secondary end points included the change in fasting plasma glucose level. Safety was assessed throughout the course of the trial.

   RESULTS: Of 135 patients who underwent randomization, 134 received at least one dose of liraglutide (66 patients) or placebo (68 patients). Demographic characteristics were similar in the two groups (mean age, 14.6 years). At the 26-week analysis of the primary efficacy end point, the mean glycated hemoglobin level had decreased by 0.64 percentage points with liraglutide and increased by 0.42 percentage points with placebo, for an estimated treatment difference of -1.06 percentage points (P<0.001); the difference increased to -1.30 percentage points by 52 weeks. The fasting plasma glucose level had decreased at both time points in the liraglutide group but had increased in the placebo group. The number of patients who reported adverse events was similar in the two groups (56 [84.8%] with liraglutide and 55 [80.9%] with placebo), but the overall rates of adverse events and gastrointestinal adverse events were higher with liraglutide.

   CONCLUSIONS: In children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes, liraglutide, at a dose of up to 1.8 mg per day (added to metformin, with or without basal insulin), was efficacious in improving glycemic control over 52 weeks. This efficacy came at the cost of an increased frequency of gastrointestinal adverse events. (Funded by Novo Nordisk; Ellipse ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01541215.).

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: We sought to determine whether insulin-sensitizing therapy (thiazolidinediones or metformin) decreased the risk of developing atrial fibrillation compared with insulin-providing therapy (insulin, sulfonylurea, or a meglitinide). Thiazolidinediones are insulin sensitizers that also decrease the inflammatory response. Because inflammation is a risk factor for atrial fibrillation, we hypothesized that treating diabetes with thiazolidinediones might decrease the risk of developing atrial fibrillation.

   METHODS: The Bypass Angioplasty Revascularization Investigation 2 Diabetes (BARI 2D) trial enrolled patients with type 2 diabetes and documented coronary artery disease. All patients were randomized to insulin-sensitizing therapy or insulin-providing therapy.

   RESULTS: A total of 2319 patients entered the study, with 1160 assigned to the insulin-sensitization strategy and 1159 assigned to the insulin-provision strategy. Over a median follow-up of 4.2 years, 90 patients (3.9%) developed new-onset atrial fibrillation. In the intention-to-treat analysis, the incidence of atrial fibrillation was 8.7 per 1000 person-years in patients assigned to insulin sensitization compared with 9.5 in patients assigned to insulin provision with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.91 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.60-1.38, P = .66). In a time-varying exposure analysis, the incidence rate per 1000 person-years was 7.2 while exposed to thiazolidinediones and 9.7 while not exposed to thiazolidinediones with an adjusted HR of 0.80 (95% CI, 0.33-1.94, P = .62). In a subset of patients matched on propensity to receive a thiazolidinediones, the HR was 0.75 (95% CI, 0.43-1.30, P = .30).

   CONCLUSIONS: We did not find a significant reduction of atrial fibrillation incidence with use of thiazolidinediones. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: We evaluated the antihyperglycemic efficacy and safety of adding the dipeptidyl dipeptidase-4 inhibitor alogliptin to metformin and sulphonylurea in the treatment of type 2 diabetes in the Examination of Cardiovascular Outcomes with Alogliptin versus Standard of Care Trial.

   METHODS: Patients with type 2 diabetes and recent acute coronary syndrome were randomized to alogliptin or placebo and standard of care. Participants were followed for up to 40 (median 18) months. In a subgroup taking metformin and sulphonylurea at baseline, we evaluated change from baseline in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), adverse events, cardiovascular outcomes, laboratory data, and other safety parameters.

   RESULTS: There were 1398 patients receiving baseline dual therapy (metformin and sulphonylurea only) randomized to alogliptin (N = 693) or placebo (N = 705); 550 patients receiving alogliptin and 505 patients receiving placebo completed the Examination of Cardiovascular Outcomes with Alogliptin versus Standard of Care without addition of other antihyperglycemic therapies (P = .008). Changes from baseline to last visit in HbA1c were -0.4% on alogliptin and +0.1% on placebo (P < .001) in all those with baseline dual therapy and -0.4% for alogliptin and +0.2% for placebo (P < .001) in those without additional therapies. Reported rates of hypoglycemia were 8.8% for alogliptin and 6.7% for placebo (P = .16). Cardiovascular death and all-cause mortality rates were lower in those receiving alogliptin compared with those receiving placebo (hazard ratio, 0.49; 95% confidence interval, 0.28-0.84 and hazard ratio, 0.61; 95% confidence interval, 0.38-0.96, respectively).

   CONCLUSIONS: Addition of the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor alogliptin to dual therapy with metformin plus sulfonylurea significantly reduced HbA1c and was well tolerated. Lower mortality rates were seen in patients treated with alogliptin in this subgroup. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  This study first time reports the hypoglycaemic activity of crude seeds powder (CSP) of Centratherum anthelminticum in healthy and type 2 diabetic volunteers. In addition, hypolipidemic effect of same CSP was also determined in healthy volunteers. Healthy individuals were divided into control and two test groups T1 and T2 treated with 200 & 400mg of CSP. Similarly, type 2 diabetic patients were also divided into positive control (PC) treated with metformin 600mg and two test groups DT1 (CSP 400mg + metformin 600mg) & DT2 (CSP 400mg). Each group has 6 individuals and each treatment was done orally. CSP 400mg was found more hypoglycaemic on all time intervals from 30 to 120min when oral glucose tolerance test was conducted in healthy volunteers. Both test quantities of CSP 200 & 400 mg were found successful in same healthy persons in decreasing the levels of triglycerides & total cholesterol (p<0.05), low & very low density lipoprotein cholesterols (p<0.01) and keeping the level of high density lipoprotein cholesterol as same as it was observed in control group. Similarly, CSP 400mg along with metformin and alone was also found helpful in lowering the fasting blood glucose levels in type 2 diabetic patients (DT1 & DT2) -24.99% and -20.62% respectively as compared to diabetic group only treated with metformin (PC), (p<0.01). Therefore, CSP of C antheminticum proves effective hypoglycaemic and hypolipidemic agent by possibly inducing glucose tolerance in healthy individuals and type 2 diabetic patients.

Abstract
  AIMS: Compare the efficacy and safety of albiglutide from a ready-to-use, single-dose, auto-injector system with the lyophilized product in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

   METHODS: In this phase 3 study, 308 patients between 18 and 80years with T2DM and experiencing inadequate glycemic control on their current regimen of diet/exercise alone or in combination with metformin were randomized 1:1 to weekly injections for 26weeks with an active albiglutide auto-injector and placebo lyophilized dual-chamber cartridge (DCC) pen injector (n=154) or active albiglutide lyophilized DCC pen injector and placebo liquid auto-injector (n=154). Participants received liquid or lyophilized albiglutide 30mg for 4weeks, and then 50mg for the remaining 22weeks. Change in HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose (FPG), pharmacokinetics, and safety were assessed.

   RESULTS: In the albiglutide liquid and lyophilized drug product groups, 55.6% (85/153) and 45.5% of patients (70/154) had a baseline HbA1c>=8.0%, respectively. The model-adjusted least squares (LS) mean change in HbA1c from baseline at week 26 was -1.1% (95% CI: -1.3, -1.0) and -1.2% (95% CI: -1.3, -1.0; noninferiority P=0.0002) in the albiglutide liquid and lyophilized product groups, respectively. Similarly, the model-adjusted LS mean change in FPG from baseline at week 26 in the albiglutide liquid and lyophilized product groups was -2.2 (95% CI: -2.6, -1.8) mmol/L and -1.9 (95% CI: -2.3, -1.5) mmol/L, respectively. No new safety concerns were identified.

   CONCLUSION: Change from baseline in HbA1c for albiglutide liquid was noninferior to lyophilized drug product in patients with T2DM. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND We investigated the effects of metformin on neurological function and oxidative stress in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with acute stroke. MATERIAL AND METHODS We randomly assigned 80 acute stroke patients to 2 groups: the metformin combined group and the insulin group. Each group had 40 patients and all were treated with standard stroke treatment. The indexes of nervous functional score and oxidative stress were measured before and 2 weeks after treatment. The primary fetal rat hippocampal neurons were gradually matured after 7 days of culture, and divided into the control group (Con), the oxygen-glucose deprivation model group (Mod), and the metformin group (Met). In the Met group, 10 mmol/L metformin was added, and the Con group and the Mod group received equal volumes of cell culture fluid. Cell viability, cell apoptosis rate, and the expression of Bax, Bcl-2, AMPK, pAMPK and mTOR were detected; MDA content and SOD activity were also detected. RESULTS Before treatment, there was no difference in the metrical indexes between the 2 groups. After treatment, the treatment group was better than the control group in neurological function scores and multiple oxidative stress-related indicators. The experimental results of primary fetal rat hippocampal neuronal cells suggest that this mechanism of improvement is closely related to the AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway. CONCLUSIONS Metformin can improve the neurological function and oxidative stress status of acute stroke patients with type 2 diabetes, and its mechanism may be related to the AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway and oxidative stress.

Abstract
  This review examines recent randomized controlled cardiovascular (CV) outcome trials of glucose-lowering therapies in type 2 diabetes and their impact on the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes. The trials were designed to comply with regulatory requirements to confirm that major adverse cardiac events (MACE) are not detrimentally affected by such therapies. Trials involving dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors did not alter a composite MACE outcome comprising CV deaths, non-fatal myocardial infarction and non-fatal stroke; however, the possibility that some members of this class might incur a small increased risk or worsening of heart failure cannot be excluded. Some studies on glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (liraglutide: LEADER trial; semaglutide: SUSTAIN-6 trial) found significant benefits for MACE, while treatment with sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (empagliflozin: EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial; canagliflozin: CANVAS trial) also significantly reduced MACE and reduced hospitalization for heart failure. Comparisons among trials are complicated by variance in the populations recruited, particularly CV status at randomization, and differences in trial design, data collection and analyses. A large proportion of patients recruited into these trials have previously experienced adverse CV events; thus, the therapies are mostly assessing secondary prevention of a further event. This contrasts with the overall type 2 diabetes population receiving glucose-lowering therapies, of whom the majority will not have had MACE and will be regarded as primary prevention. Overall, the trials provide reassuring evidence that new glucose-lowering medications do not adversely affect CV events and some of these agents may offer CV protection.

Abstract
  Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving oral hypoglycemic drugs (OHDs) are usually instructed to stop them before surgery. We hypothesize that continuing OHD preoperatively should result in lower perioperative blood glucose (BG) levels. Ambulatory surgery patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus on OHDs were randomized to continue (n = 69) or withhold (n = 73) OHDs preoperatively. Log-transformed BG levels at pre-, intra-, and postoperative periods were analyzed. Perioperative BG levels were significantly lower (mean, 138 mg/dL; 95% confidence interval, 130-146 mg/dL) in the group that continued versus the group that discontinued OHDs (mean, 156 mg/dL; 95% confidence interval, 146-167 mg/dL; P < .001).

Abstract
  Importance: Phase 3 trials have not compared oral semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist, with other classes of glucose-lowering therapy.

   Objective: To compare efficacy and assess long-term adverse event profiles of once-daily oral semaglutide vs sitagliptin, 100 mg added on to metformin with or without sulfonylurea, in patients with type 2 diabetes.

   Design, Setting, and Participants: Randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group, phase 3a trial conducted at 206 sites in 14 countries over 78 weeks from February 2016 to March 2018. Of 2463 patients screened, 1864 adults with type 2 diabetes uncontrolled with metformin with or without sulfonylurea were randomized.

   Interventions: Patients were randomized to receive once-daily oral semaglutide, 3 mg (n = 466), 7 mg (n = 466), or 14 mg (n = 465), or sitagliptin, 100 mg (n = 467). Semaglutide was initiated at 3 mg/d and escalated every 4 weeks, first to 7 mg/d then to 14 mg/d, until the randomized dosage was achieved.

   Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was change in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and the key secondary end point was change in body weight, both from baseline to week 26. Both were assessed at weeks 52 and 78 as additional secondary end points. End points were tested for noninferiority with respect to HbA1c (noninferiority margin, 0.3%) prior to testing for superiority of HbA1c and body weight.

   Results: Among 1864 patients randomized (mean age, 58 [SD, 10] years; mean baseline HbA1c, 8.3% [SD, 0.9%]; mean body mass index, 32.5 [SD, 6.4]; n=879 [47.2%] women), 1758 (94.3%) completed the trial and 298 prematurely discontinued treatment (16.7% for semaglutide, 3 mg/d; 15.0% for semaglutide, 7 mg/d; 19.1% for semaglutide, 14 mg/d; and 13.1% for sitagliptin). Semaglutide, 7 and 14 mg/d, compared with sitagliptin, significantly reduced HbA1c (differences, -0.3% [95% CI, -0.4% to -0.1%] and -0.5% [95% CI, -0.6% to -0.4%], respectively; P < .001 for both) and body weight (differences, -1.6 kg [95% CI, -2.0 to -1.1 kg] and -2.5 kg [95% CI, -3.0 to -2.0 kg], respectively; P < .001 for both) from baseline to week 26. Noninferiority of semaglutide, 3 mg/d, with respect to HbA1c was not demonstrated. Week 78 reductions in both end points were statistically significantly greater with semaglutide, 14 mg/d, vs sitagliptin.

   Conclusions and Relevance: Among adults with type 2 diabetes uncontrolled with metformin with or without sulfonylurea, oral semaglutide, 7 mg/d and 14 mg/d, compared with sitagliptin, resulted in significantly greater reductions in HbA1c over 26 weeks, but there was no significant benefit with the 3-mg/d dosage. Further research is needed to assess effectiveness in a clinical setting.

Abstract
  The goal of diabetic drug treatment is to stabilize the blood sugar for a long time to close to the normal level, to correct the metabolic disorder and eliminate the symptoms. At present, glimepiride has become commonly used drugs for the treatment of diabetes with obesity. Compared with metformin, acarbose and rosiglitazone, glimepiride has different mechanisms of drug action, clinical combination showed synergistic hypoglycemic effect, good clinical curative effect. So, we use three treatments to study as group A (glimepiride and metformin); group B (glimepiride and acarbose); Group C (glimepiride and rosiglitazone). From the analysis of drug economics, glimepiride and metformin scheme is better, has the lowest cost per unit cost effect. From the comparison of scheme is efficient, the best curative effect is rosiglitazone plus glimepiride, effective rate as 96.7%. At the same time, the drug can be rationally used to reduce the occurrence of some drug-induced diseases and adverse drug reactions.

Abstract
  AIM: We investigated the effect of alogliptin and gliclazide on endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) in type 2 diabetes.

   METHODS: Eighty patients with type 2 diabetes and HbA1c between 7.5% and 8.5% were randomized to receive either alogliptin (25 mg/daily) or gliclazide extended-release (30 mg/daily for HbA1c 7.5-8.0% and 60 mg/daily for HbA1c 8.0-8.5%) in combination with metformin for 4 months. At baseline and 4 months, clinical and laboratory parameters of EPCs were determined.

   RESULTS: After 4 months of treatment, alogliptin and gliclazide resulted in a similar significant reduction in HbA1c (%) (8.0+/-0.3 vs. 7.1+/-0.2, and 8.0+/-0.3 vs. 7.0+/-0.2, respectively; P<0.05) and a similar and significant increase in EPC count (cells/106 WBC) (CD45-CD133+KDR+ : 2.2+/-1.2 vs. 3.7+/-1.6, CD45-CD34+KDR+: 3.3+/-1.8 vs. 4.9+/-1.8; P<0.05 for alogliptin; CD45-CD133+KDR+: 2.3+/-1.3 vs. 3.6+/-1.5, CD45-CD34+KDR+: 3.1+/-1.3 vs. 4.6+/-1.7; P<0.05 for gliclazide).

   CONCLUSIONS: Both alogliptin and gliclazide demonstrated a beneficial effect in increasing EPCs in poorly controlled type 2 diabetes. As alogliptin and gliclazide exhibit different mechanisms of action, the observed increase in EPCs seems to be due to their glucose-lowering effect. Copyright © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart .

Abstract
  OBJECTIVES: To compare the safety and efficacy of combination of Glimepiride - Metformin with Vildagliptin - Metformin in type 2 diabetic patients with HbA1c between 7.5to10.

   METHODS: A randomized, prospective, comparative and interventional study was conducted at Indira Gandhi Medical College, Shimla. The level of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), fasting blood sugar (FBS) and postprandial blood sugar (PP) were the primary outcomes, whereas, the evidence of hypoglycemia, quality of life and weight gain were recorded as secondary outcomes. 215 patients newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus were randomized into Glimepiride-Metformin group (Group1) having 111 patients and Vildagliptin-Metformin group (Group 2) having 106 patients. Patients were followed up at 3 month, 12 month, 24 month and then after completion of 30 month of treatment.

   RESULTS: A comparable FPG, PPPG and HbA1c were observed from baseline at the end of 12 weeks in both groups. However, at the 130-week endpoint a significantly more pronounced reduction in HbA1c was observed in vildagliptin-metformin (1.96%) arm compared to Glimepiride-metformin (1.67%) arm. A similar significant more pronounced reduction was demonstrated in both FPG (48.25% vs. 41.70%) and PPPG (49.40% vs. 42.95%) in vildagliptin-metformin group compared to Glimepiride-metformin group. The proportion of patients who achieved an A1C < 7% at 130-weeks was 49% in the vildagliptin group and 41% in the Glimepiride group. Statistically significant more weight gain was observed in Glimepiride arm compared to vildagliptin arm (2.09 kg vs. 0.69 kg) and 8-fold lower incidence was observed in vildagliptin group. Conclusion : Vildagliptin -metformin represent a more effective combination in terms of number of patients achieving guidelines recommended A1C target of less than 7% at the end of 30 months, less weight gain, and a lower risk of hypoglycemia in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients with moderate hypoglycemia.

   CONCLUSIONS: Vildagliptin -metformin represent a more effective combination in terms of number of patients achieving guidelines recommended A1C target of less than 7% at the end of 30 months, less weight gain, and a lower risk of hypoglycemia in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients with moderate hypoglycemia.

Abstract
  AIMS: To directly compare the effectiveness and safety between two distinct sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, empagliflozin and dapagliflozin, as part of a quadruple oral antidiabetic agents (OADs) in patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes (T2D).

   METHODS: This study was an open-labeled, prospective, 52-week study conducted in T2D patients with glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) ranging 7.5-12.0% with metformin, glimepiride and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors. Patients were divided into either empagliflozin (25mg/day) or dapagliflozin (10mg/day). The outcome measures included changes in HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and cardiometabolic variables and the safety profiles.

   RESULTS: In total, 350 patients were enrolled with empagliflozin (n=176) and dapagliflozin (n=174), respectively. After 52weeks, both groups showed significant reductions in HbA1c and FPG, but the reduction was greater in the empagliflozin group (P<0.001). Both groups showed significantly decreased blood pressure and body weight and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were increased in the empagliflozin (between groups, P=0.035). Both groups showed similar safety profiles.

   CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that SGLT2 inhibitors can be effectively used as a fourth OAD in T2D patients who are treated with three other OADs. More specifically, empagliflozin was more effective in reducing HbA1c and improving other cardiometabolic parameters than dapagliflozin. Clinical Trial Number NCT03748810 (ClinicalTrials.gov).

Abstract
  AIMS: To describe the characteristics and treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus initiating a second-line glucose-lowering therapy in the global DISCOVER study programme.

   METHODS: DISCOVER comprises two similar 3-year prospective observational studies (NCT02322762 and NCT02226822), involving 15,992 patients initiating a second-line glucose-lowering therapy in 38 countries across six regions (Africa, Americas, South-East Asia, Eastern Mediterranean, Europe and Western Pacific).

   RESULTS: Overall, 54.2% of patients were male (across region range [ARR]: 37.7-58.6%). At baseline, mean age and time since diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus were 57.2 (ARR: 53.1-61.9)and 5.6 (ARR: 4.6-6.9) years, respectively. Median glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) was 63.9mmol/mol (8.0%; ARR: 7.6-8.3%). Microvascular and macrovascular complications were reported in 18.9% (ARR: 14.5-23.5%) and 12.7% (ARR: 5.0-26.6%) of patients, respectively. First-line treatments were mostly metformin monotherapy (55.6%; ARR: 42.5-83.6%) and combinations of metformin with a sulfonylurea (14.4%; ARR: 5.8-31.1%). The most commonly prescribed second-line therapies were combinations of metformin with a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (23.5%; ARR: 2.2-29.6%) or a sulfonylurea (20.9%; ARR: 13.6-57.1%).

   CONCLUSIONS: DISCOVER demonstrates considerable global variation in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, and a need for more aggressive risk factor control. Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Diabetic kidney disease is a major cause of premature mortality in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Worsening insulin sensitivity independent of glycemic control may contribute to the development of diabetic kidney disease. We investigated the longitudinal association of insulin sensitivity with hyperfiltration and increased albumin excretion in adolescents with T2DM.

   STUDY DESIGN: Observational prospective cohort study.

   SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 532 TODAY (Treatment Options for Type 2 Diabetes in Adolescents and Youth) participants aged 12 to 17 years with T2DM duration less than 2 years at baseline. The TODAY Study was a multicenter randomized clinical trial that examined the efficacy of 3 treatment regimens (metformin monotherapy, metformin plus rosiglitazone, or metformin plus an intensive lifestyle intervention program) to achieve durable glycemic control.

   PREDICTORS: Natural log-transformed estimated insulin sensitivity (reciprocal of fasting insulin), hemoglobin A1c concentration, age, race-ethnicity, treatment group, body mass index, loss of glycemic control, and hypertension.

   OUTCOMES: Hyperfiltration was defined as 99th percentile or higher of estimated glomerular filtration rate (>=140mL/min/1.73m2) when referenced to healthy adolescents (NHANES 1999-2002) and albumin-creatinine ratio >= 30mug/mg at 3 consecutive annual visits.

   RESULTS: Hyperfiltration was observed in 7.0% of participants at baseline and in 13.3% by 5 years, with a cumulative incidence of 5.0% over 5 years. The prevalence of increased albumin excretion was 6% at baseline and 18% by 5 years, with a cumulative incidence of 13.4%. There was an 8% increase in risk for hyperfiltration per 10% lower estimated insulin sensitivity in unadjusted and adjusted models (P=0.01). Increased albumin excretion was associated with hemoglobin A1c concentration, but not estimated insulin sensitivity.

   LIMITATIONS: Longer follow-up is needed to capture the transition from hyperfiltration to rapid glomerular filtration rate decline in youth-onset T2DM.

   CONCLUSIONS: Lower estimated insulin sensitivity was associated with risk for hyperfiltration over time, whereas increased albumin excretion was associated with hyperglycemia in youth-onset T2DM. Copyright © 2017 National Kidney Foundation, Inc. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: When metformin is insufficient for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), the optimal adjunctive therapy is unclear. This meta-analysis was to compare the efficacy and safety of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors with sulfonylureas (SUs) as second-line therapy in patients with T2DM inadequately controlled on metformin.

   METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov for randomized controlled trials comparing SGLT2 inhibitors with SUs as add-on to metformin. Our primary endpoints were glycemic control, hypoglycemia, and change in weight. We assessed pooled data using a random-effects model.

   RESULTS: Five trials involving 4300 participants were included in our meta-analysis. Compared with SUs, SGLT2 inhibitors led to no significant reduction in changes in HbA1c (mean difference [MD] - 0.06; 95% confidence interval [CI] [- 0.12, 0.08]), but less hypoglycemia as add-on to metformin (odds ratio [OR] 0.12; 95% CI [0.07, 0.21]). SGLT2 inhibitors led to a reduction in weight by about 3.5 kg; however, SUs caused a gain in weight by about 1 kg (MD - 4.39; 95% CI [- 4.64, - 4.14]). SGLT2 inhibitors also showed a reduction in blood pressure, but increased the incidence of genital tract infections compared with SUs. Interestingly, subgroup analysis by duration of interventions showed that reduction of HbA1c from baseline was similar between the two groups at 12-52 weeks, but SGLT2 inhibitors led to a greater reduction in HbA1c at 104-208 weeks.

   CONCLUSIONS: Despite similar glycemic efficacy in a relatively short term, SGLT2 inhibitors are more effective in the longer term than SUs as add-on to metformin. In addition, SGLT2 inhibitors produce less hypoglycemic events and lead to greater reductions in weight and blood pressure compared with SUs.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: Ertugliflozin is approved in the US and European Union as a stand-alone product for adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus as once daily (QD) dosing. The approved fixed-dose combination (FDC) of ertugliflozin and immediate-release metformin is dosed twice daily (BID). This study assessed steady-state pharmacokinetics (PK; area under the concentration-time curve over 24 hours (AUC24)) and pharmacodynamics (PD; urinary glucose excretion over 24 hours (UGE24)) for ertugliflozin 5 and 15 mg total daily doses administered BID or QD.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this open-label, two-cohort, randomized, multiple-dose, crossover study, healthy subjects received ertugliflozin 2.5 mg BID and 5 mg QD (n = 28) or ertugliflozin 7.5 mg BID and 15 mg QD (n = 22) for 6 days. Plasma and urine samples were collected for 24 hour post morning dose on day 6 in each period.

   RESULTS: The geometric mean ratio (GMR) (90% CI) of ertugliflozin AUC24 was 100.8% (98.8%, 102.8%) for 2.5 mg BID vs. 5 mg QD, and 99.7% (97.1%, 102.5%) for 7.5 mg BID vs. 15 mg QD. GMR (90% CI) of UGE24 for BID vs. QD administration was 110.2% (103.0%, 117.9%) at a total daily dose of 5 mg, and 102.8% (97.7%, 108.1%) at 15 mg. The 90% CIs of the GMR of AUC24 and UGE24 for BID vs. QD dosing were within the acceptance range for equivalence (80 - 125%) and the prespecified criterion for similarity (70 - 143%), respectively. All treatments were well tolerated.

   CONCLUSION: There are no clinically meaningful differences in steady-state PK or PD between ertugliflozin BID and QD regimens at total daily doses of 5 and 15 mg, supporting BID administration of ertugliflozin as a component of the ertugliflozin/metformin (immediate-release) FDC.

Abstract
  Guidelines increasingly highlight the importance of multifactorial management in type 2 diabetes, in contrast to the more traditional focus on glycemic control. Semaglutide, a recently approved glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, is indicated in Canada for adults with type 2 diabetes to improve glycemic control as monotherapy with diet and exercise when metformin is inappropriate or as an add-on to either metformin alone or metformin plus a sulfonylurea or basal insulin. The Semaglutide Unabated Sustainability in Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes (SUSTAIN) clinical trial program for semaglutide comprises 6 pivotal global phase 3a trials (SUSTAIN 1 through 6) and 2 Japanese phase 3a trials. Phase 3b trials include SUSTAIN 7, and SUSTAIN 8 and 9 (both ongoing). Results from the completed trials support the superiority of semaglutide for reduction of glycated hemoglobin levels and weight loss vs. placebo as well as active comparators, including sitagliptin, exenatide extended-release, dulaglutide and insulin glargine. SUSTAIN 6 trial data confirmed cardiovascular safety and demonstrated significant reductions in major cardiovascular events with semaglutide vs. placebo, an outcome that confirmed the noninferiority of semaglutide. The robust and sustained effects of semaglutide on glycated hemoglobin levels and weight loss vs. comparators, as well as its safety and possible cardiovascular benefit, address an unmet need in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. This article overviews data from across the semaglutide clinical trial program, including efficacy and safety results and findings from post hoc analyses. The potential place of semaglutide in clinical practice is discussed. Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Individuals with fragile X syndrome (FXS) have both behavioral and medical comorbidities and the latter include obesity in approximately 30% and the Prader-Willi Phenotype (PWP) characterized by severe hyperphagia and morbid obesity in less than 10%. Metformin is a drug used in individuals with type 2 diabetes, obesity or impaired glucose tolerance and it has a strong safety profile in children and adults. Recently published studies in the Drosophila model and the knock out mouse model of FXS treated with metformin demonstrate the rescue of multiple phenotypes of FXS.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: We present 7 cases of individuals with FXS who have been treated with metformin clinically. One case with type 2 diabetes, 3 cases with the PWP, 2 adults with obesity and/or behavioral problems and, a young child with FXS. These individuals were clinically treated with metformin and monitored for behavioral changes with the Aberrant Behavior Checklist and metabolic changes with a fasting glucose and HgbA1c.

   RESULTS: We found consistent improvements in irritability, social responsiveness, hyperactivity, and social avoidance, in addition to comments from the family regarding improvements in language and conversational skills. No significant side-effects were noted and most patients with obesity lost weight.

   CONCLUSION: We recommend a controlled trial of metformin in those with FXS. Metformin appears to be an effective treatment of obesity including those with the PWP in FXS. Our study suggests that metformin may also be a targeted treatment for improving behavior and language in children and adults with FXS. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Abstract
  AIMS: To compare the efficacy and safety of biphasic insulin aspart 30 (BIAsp 30) administered three times daily (TID) vs. twice daily (BID), plus metformin, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) inadequately controlled on basal insulin +/- 1 oral antidiabetic drug (OAD).

   METHODS: Randomised, multinational, open-label, treat-to-target trial. Subjects inadequately controlled (HbA1c 7.5-10.0%) on basal insulin and metformin+/-1 OAD were randomised to BIAsp30 TID (n=220) or BIAsp30 BID (n=217). Primary endpoint was change from baseline in HbA1c after 24weeks of treatment.

   RESULTS: Most (400/437, 91.5%) subjects completed the trial. The majority (276/400 [69.0%]) were from the China region. After 24weeks, HbA1c decreased comparably in both BIAsp 30 groups (-1.7% vs. -1.6% [-19 vs. -18mmol/mol], for TID and BID dosing, respectively; estimated treatment difference: -0.09% [-0.23; 0.06]95% CI, -1 mmol/mol [-3; 1], p=0.26). Safety profiles, including number of subjects experiencing hypoglycaemia, were similar.

   CONCLUSIONS: BIAsp 30 administered either TID or BID with metformin was a safe and effective option when intensifying treatment after failure of basal insulin and OADs in patients with T2DM. Adding a third injection at lunchtime may be preferable if HbA1c remains above target, if the lunchtime meal is the largest meal of the day, or if persistent postprandial hyperglycaemia after lunch is observed.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists are effective treatments for type 2 diabetes, lowering glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and weight, but are currently only approved for use as subcutaneous injections. Oral semaglutide, a novel GLP-1 agonist, was compared with subcutaneous liraglutide and placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes.

   METHODS: In this randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, phase 3a trial, we recruited patients with type 2 diabetes from 100 sites in 12 countries. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, with HbA1c of 7.0-9.5% (53-80.3 mmol/mol), on a stable dose of metformin (>=1500 mg or maximum tolerated) with or without a sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor. Participants were randomly assigned (2:2:1) with an interactive web-response system and stratified by background glucose-lowering medication and country of origin, to once-daily oral semaglutide (dose escalated to 14 mg), once-daily subcutaneous liraglutide (dose escalated to 1.8 mg), or placebo for 52 weeks. Two estimands were defined: treatment policy (regardless of study drug discontinuation or rescue medication) and trial product (assumed all participants were on study drug without rescue medication) in all participants who were randomly assigned. The treatment policy estimand was the primary estimand. The primary endpoint was change from baseline to week 26 in HbA1c (oral semaglutide superiority vs placebo and non-inferiority [margin: 0.4%] and superiority vs subcutaneous liraglutide) and the confirmatory secondary endpoint was change from baseline to week 26 in bodyweight (oral semaglutide superiority vs placebo and liraglutide). Safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one dose of study drug. This trial is registered on Clinicaltrials.gov, number NCT02863419, and the European Clinical Trials registry, number EudraCT 2015-005210-30.

   FINDINGS: Between Aug 10, 2016, and Feb 7, 2017, 950 patients were screened, of whom 711 were eligible and randomly assigned to oral semaglutide (n=285), subcutaneous liraglutide (n=284), or placebo (n=142). 341 (48%) of 711 participants were female and the mean age was 56 years (SD 10). All participants were given at least one dose of study drug, and 277 (97%) participants in the oral semaglutide group, 274 (96%) in the liraglutide group, and 134 (94%) in the placebo group completed the 52-week trial period. Mean change from baseline in HbA1c at week 26 was -1.2% (SE 0.1) with oral semaglutide, -1.1% (SE 0.1) with subcutaneous liraglutide, and -0.2% (SE 0.1) with placebo. Oral semaglutide was non-inferior to subcutaneous liraglutide in decreasing HbA1c (estimated treatment difference [ETD] -0.1%, 95% CI -0.3 to 0.0; p<0.0001) and superior to placebo (ETD -1.1%, -1.2 to -0.9; p<0.0001) by use of the treatment policy estimand. By use of the trial product estimand, oral semaglutide had significantly greater decreases in HbA1c than both subcutaneous liraglutide (ETD -0.2%, 95% CI -0.3 to -0.1; p=0.0056) and placebo (ETD -1.2%, -1.4 to -1.0; p<0.0001) at week 26. Oral semaglutide resulted in superior weight loss (-4.4 kg [SE 0.2]) compared with liraglutide (-3.1 kg [SE 0.2]; ETD -1.2 kg, 95% CI -1.9 to -0.6; p=0.0003) and placebo (-0.5 kg [SE 0.3]; ETD -3.8 kg, -4.7 to -3.0; p<0.0001) at week 26 (treatment policy). By use of the trial product estimand, weight loss at week 26 was significantly greater with oral semaglutide than with subcutaneous liraglutide (-1.5 kg, 95% CI -2.2 to -0.9; p<0.0001) and placebo (ETD -4.0 kg, -4.8 to -3.2; p<0.0001). Adverse events were more frequent with oral semaglutide (n=229 [80%]) and subcutaneous liraglutide (n=211 [74%]) than with placebo (n=95 [67%]).

   INTERPRETATION: Oral semaglutide was non-inferior to subcutaneous liraglutide and superior to placebo in decreasing HbA1c, and superior in decreasing bodyweight compared with both liraglutide and placebo at week 26. Safety and tolerability of oral semaglutide were similar to subcutaneous liraglutide. Use of oral semaglutide could potentially lead to earlier initiation of GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy in the diabetes treatment continuum of care.

Abstract
  Achieving and maintaining recommended glycemic targets without causing adverse e ffects, including hypoglycemia, is challenging, especially in older patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The introduction of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, more than 10 years ago, has provided an alternative to conventional medications for the intensification of glucose-lowering treatment after failure of metformin monotherapy, and therefore, marked an important advance in the management of T2DM. By prolonging the activity of incretin hormones, DPP-4 inhibitors induce insulin release and decrease glucagon secretion in a glucose-dependent manner. This results in a more physiologic glycemic control as compared to that ensured by insulin secretagogues (sulfonylureas and glinides). Overall, DPP-4 inhibitors have a favorable safety profile and can be used without dose adjustments in older adults and in patients with mild renal impairment; they have a neutral effect on body weight and do not cause hypoglycemia by themselves. Safety issues, reported mainly in post-marketing surveillance programs and including cardiovascular outcomes and the risk of acute pancreatitis, are being extensively investigated. The aim of this review is to discuss the impact of DPP-4 inhibitors on the treatment of T2DM, after 10 years of experience, with an emphasis on diabetes care in Italy. We will first describe T2DM treatment in Italy and then provide an overview of the main findings from randomized controlled trials, real-world studies and post-marketing surveillance programs with DPP-4 inhibitors.

Abstract
  The study of nonindicated medications on cancer outcomes is challenged by potential time-related biases. The literature has strongly advocated for treating the exposure as time-varying and summarizing the outcomes through a dose-response model (an etiologic-focused analysis). An alternative is to refashion the data to resemble a hypothetical randomized trial of drug use (an action-focused analysis). To our knowledge, their relative treatment of time-related bias and aspects of interpretation have not been compared. In this commentary, using the study of metformin use on colorectal cancer risk by Bradley and colleagues (2018) as motivation, we compare the etiologic versus action-focused analysis of epidemiologic data. We examine their treatment of immortal person-time, time-varying confounding, selection bias, and the biological and clinical relevance of their results. In doing so, we aim to establish areas of common ground and points of departure that can guide future observational studies of medications on cancer risk, recurrence, and survival.

Abstract
  It is unknown whether YOD (young onset diabetes) and LOD (late onset diabetes) require similar insulin doses for intensive insulin therapy with a metformin add-on to achieve glycemic control. We analyzed data from our two previously performed randomized, controlled open-label trials. Patients were randomized to receive either continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) therapy or CSII combined with metformin therapy for 4 weeks. The studies concentrated on the differences in the insulin doses used for the two groups. We included 36 YOD (age < 40 yrs) and 152 LOD (age > 40 yrs) patients. YOD patients who received metformin combined with CSII therapy required significantly lower insulin doses to maintain euglycemic control compared to patients with LOD. A multivariate analysis, controlled for gender and the fasting blood concentration, was performed to determine the significance of the differences between groups, particularly with respect to the total and basal insulin doses. There was a trend toward improvement in beta-cell function and insulin resistance in terms of DELTAHOMA-B and DELTAHOMA-IR in patients with YOD compared to those with LOD. Newly diagnosed T2D patients with YOD required significantly lower insulin doses, particularly basal insulin doses, to maintain glycemic control compared to the LOD patients.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Of the 84 million American adults with prediabetes, over 5 to 7 years, about 28 million progress to type 2 diabetes. We aimed to assess whether a real-world, pathophysiology-based, therapeutic approach could prevent development of type 2 diabetes in high-risk individuals.

   METHODS: We did a retrospective observational study of people at increased risk of type 2 diabetes from a community practice in southern California, USA. Participants had an oral glucose tolerance test and were assigned a risk stratification on the basis of presence and severity of insulin resistance, impaired beta-cell function, and glycaemia (ie, 1-h plasma glucose concentration of more than 8.6 mmol/L during an oral glucose tolerance test). Treatment was recommended on the basis of risk: metformin, pioglitazone, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, and lifestyle therapy for participants at high risk of diabetes, and metformin, pioglitazone, and lifestyle therapy for those at intermediate risk. Individuals who refused pharmacological therapy were assigned to lifestyle therapy only. Participants were followed up every 6 months and oral glucose tolerance tests were repeated at 6 months and subsequently every 2 years or sooner. The primary outcome of our analysis was incidence of type 2 diabetes according to the American Diabetes Association criteria, within the study period (2009-16). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT03308773.

   FINDINGS: Between Jan 1, 2009 and Dec 31, 2016, we assessed 1769 people at increased risk of diabetes, of which 747 (42%) were identified at high or intermediate risk and were recommended pharmacological treatment. Of 422 participants analysed, 28 (7%) progressed to type 2 diabetes (seven [5%] of 141 participants who received metformin, pioglitazone, and lifestyle therapy, none [0%] of 81 who received metformin, pioglitazone, GLP-1 receptor agonist, and lifestyle therapy, and 21 [11%] of 200 who received lifestyle therapy only) after mean follow-up of 32.09 months (SEM 1.24). Compared with participants who received lifestyle therapy only, the adjusted hazard ratio for progression to type 2 diabetes was 0.29 (95% CI 0.11-0.78, p=0.0009) in participants who received metformin and pioglitazone, and 0.12 (95% CI 0.02-0.94, p=0.04) in participants who received metformin, pioglitazone, and GLP-1 receptor agonist. Improved beta-cell function was the strongest predictor of type 2 diabetes prevention.

   INTERPRETATION: Progression to type 2 diabetes in people at high risk of diabetes can be markedly reduced with interventions designed to correct underlying pathophysiological disturbances (ie, impaired insulin secretion and resistance) in a real-world setting.

Abstract
  Background: Preclinical data suggest that metformin may reduce breast cancer incidence and improve cancer prognosis. However, the current evidence in observational studies is inconclusive. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to assess the effect of metformin on the incidence of breast cancer and all-cause mortality in patients with type II diabetes (T2D). Methods: A literature search was performed on Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane library from inception to November 2016. Outcomes were incidence of breast cancer and all-cause mortality. Risk of bias and overall certainty of evidence was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE), respectively. Meta-analyses were performed using the most fully adjusted ORs or HRs and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) as effect measures. Results: A total of 12 observational studies were included for breast cancer incidence and 11 studies for all-cause mortality. No significant association was found between metformin exposure and incidence of breast cancer (OR = 0.93; 95% CI, 0.85-1.03; I2 = 35%). A 45% risk reduction was observed for all-cause mortality (HR = 0.55; 95% CI, 0.44-0.70; I2 = 81%). Presence of publication bias is strongly suspected for both outcomes using Egger's funnel plots. Conclusions: The use of metformin may improve overall survival in patients with T2D and breast cancer. No effect of metformin on the incidence of breast cancer was observed. Interpretation of results is limited by the observational nature of the studies and resulting biases. Impact: Clinical trials are warranted to determine the role of metformin in breast cancer risk reduction and prognosis. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 27(6); 627-35. ©2018 AACR.

Abstract
  AIMS/INTRODUCTION: We compared the efficacy and safety of insulin glargine 300 U/mL (Gla300) and insulin degludec U100 (Deg) using a flash glucose monitoring system.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 24 Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes were randomized to receive once-daily Gla300 (n = 12) or Deg (n = 12) in the morning. The primary end-points were the mean percentage of time in the target glucose range (70-179 mg/dL) and hypoglycemia (<70 mg/dL), as measured using flash glucose monitoring during the last 7 days of each 14-day period.

   RESULTS: The percentages of time with glucose levels <70 mg/dL were not significantly different between the two insulin treatments. No significant differences were observed in the percentages of time with glucose levels of 70-179 mg/dL or >=180 mg/dL. The percentage of time with nocturnal hypoglycemia with Gla300 was significantly lower than that with Deg treatment (P = 0.021). This difference might be attributable to the difference in the duration of action between the two formulations, and the incidence of nocturnal hypoglycemia with Deg treatment was associated with the concomitant use of metformin (P = 0.035).

   CONCLUSIONS: The two formulations were comparable in efficacy, whereas the incidence of nocturnal hypoglycemia was significantly lower with Gla300. Thus, the present study suggests that, although Gla300 and Deg are comparable long-acting insulin analogs, Gla300 is safer with respect to the incidence of hypoglycemia. Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

Abstract
  AIMS/INTRODUCTION: To compare the effects of gliclazide, liraglutide and metformin on body composition in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 85 patients were randomly allocated to receive gliclazide (n = 27), liraglutide (n = 29) or metformin (n = 29) monotherapy for 24 weeks. Body composition was measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry.

   RESULTS: Liraglutide and metformin reduced total, trunk, limb, android and gynoid fat mass; this also led to weight reduction. However, gliclazide treatment produced no significant changes in weight or fat mass, likely because reductions in fat mass were concomitant with increases in lean tissue mass. Blood glucose concentrations and glycated hemoglobin levels improved in all treatment arms; levels of the latter were lower in patients treated with liraglutide and metformin. Serum alanine aminotransferase concentrations decreased in all treatment arms, whereas serum aspartate aminotransferase concentrations were reduced only by liraglutide and metformin. In all patients, weight loss and total, trunk, limb, and android fat mass reductions were positively correlated with decreases in serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels, whereas reductions in waist circumference were positively correlated with lower serum alanine aminotransferase levels.

   CONCLUSIONS: Compared with gliclazide, liraglutide and metformin monotherapies result in greater weight loss, reductions in body fat mass, and better blood glucose control among type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Reductions in weight, fat mass and waist circumference favorably affect hepatic function. Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Subclinical myocardial injury, as measured by high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hsTnT), and myocardial stress, as measured by N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), are related to glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, and are strong predictors of adverse cardiovascular outcomes. We sought to determine whether antihyperglycemic therapy improves measures of myocardial injury and myocardial stress in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

   METHODS AND RESULTS: We randomized, in a 2x2 factorial fashion, 438 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus to insulin glargine, metformin, the combination, or placebo and measured changes in NT-proBNP and hsTnT after 12 weeks of therapy. At baseline, the median (Q1-Q3) plasma concentration was 35.4 (15.7-86.3) ng/L for NT-proBNP and 6.7 (4.6-10.1) ng/L for hsTnT. The adjusted (95% confidence interval) change in NT-proBNP concentration was 20.7% (7.9-35.0) in the insulin arm compared with 0.13% (-10.8 to 12.5) in the no-insulin arm (P=0.03 for comparison). These changes were not related to changes in fasting or postprandial glucose, glycated hemoglobin, weight, blood pressure, or inflammation. In the metformin arm, the adjusted change in NT-proBNP was 7.8% (-3.7 to 20.7) compared with 13.0% (0.72-26.8) in the no-metformin arm (P=0.58). No significant changes in hsTnT concentrations were observed for any of the treatment arms.

   CONCLUSIONS: Insulin glargine was associated with a significant 20.7% increase in NT-proBNP, a marker of myocardial stress, after 12 weeks of therapy. No change in hsTnT, a marker of myocardial injury, was observed. The changes were independent of substantial improvements in glucose control.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: The prognosis for small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is very poor, so a new therapeutic strategy and new drugs are imperative.

   OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to examine the effect of metformin on the prognosis of patients with SCLC combined with diabetes mellitus (DM).

   MATERIAL AND METHODS: From 2005 to 2013, 32 patients (4 female and 28 male) with SCLC combined with DM were included in this retrospective study at the Zhejiang Cancer Hospital, China. All patients were diagnosed with SCLC by pathological analysis and had received more than 4 cycles of chemotherapy. Metformin was used in 12 patients. Seventeen patients had limited-stage disease (LD) and 15 patients had extensive-stage disease (ED). Patients with LD SCLC were administered thoracic radiotherapy. The follow-up deadline was January 27, 2016. At that point, 4 patients were alive, 21 patients had died, and 7 patients did not participate in follow-up examinations.

   RESULTS: In patients with SCLC combined with DM using metformin, a complete response (CR) was observed in 4 patients, a partial response (PR) in 6 patients, a stable disease (SD) in 1 patient, and a progressive disease (PD) in 1 patient, whereas in patients who did not use metformin, CR was observed in 2 patients, PR in 15 patients, SD in 2 patients, and PD in 1 patient (p = 0.384). There was no difference in the median survival time (MST) between patients using metformin and those who did not (12 vs 13 months; p = 0.784). There was a trend toward prolonged MST in patients with LD SCLC using metformin compared with those who did not use metformin (58 vs 29 months; p = 0.084). There was no difference due to the use of metformin observed in MST of patients with ED SCLC (12 vs 13 months; p = 0.396).

   CONCLUSIONS: Metformin use may have a prognostic benefit in patients with SCLC combined with DM. This combination is promising and further clinical trials are required.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Our previous preclinical study showed that the extract mixture (EM) of Andrographis paniculata (Burm. f.) Wall. ex Nees (AP) and Syzygium polyanthum (Wight.) Walp (SP) leaves had antidiabetic effects and were beneficial on alloxan-induced diabetic rats.

   PURPOSE: The objectives of this study were to: 1) identify the phytochemical compounds present in aqueous extract of AP and SP and 2) examine the benefits of the EM of AP and SP leaves in lowering blood glucose in the presence of standard antidiabetic treatment using metformin in type 2 diabetic patients in Indonesian Traditional Medicine Polyclinic of Dr. Soetomo General Hospital in Surabaya.

   METHODS: Phytochemical analysis of aqueous leaf extract of AP and SP was performed using standard chemical tests, TLC, and GC-MS. Furthermore, a total of 54 subjects with T2DM participated in this study and were randomly assigned to either the intervention group supplemented with the extract mixture of AP and SP at a dose 900 mg/day for 8 weeks, or the control group which received placebo tablets in a randomized placebo-controlled double-blinded parallel clinical trial. Both groups received metformin at dose 1000 mg/day. Body weight, blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, postprandial glucose, haemoglobin A1c, triglycerides, total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein, high density lipoprotein, and markers of liver and kidney damage were measured.

   RESULTS: The results of phytochemical analysis showed that the glycosides, terpenoids, alkaloids, flavonoids, saponins, and tannins were found to be present in the extract mixture. GC-MS analyses of AP and SP showed the presence of 19 and 12 peaks, respectively. Methyl ester of 9-octadecenoic and eicosanoic acid were determined as the main constituents of both species. Moreover, the results of clinical study suggested that the extract mixture improved the decrease of fasting blood glucose and postprandial glucose, significantly lowered body mass index compared with the control group. The EM appeared beneficial for SGPT values and uric acid levels.

   CONCLUSION: Overall, the results of this study suggested the potential beneficial effects of the extract mixture for use as complementary medicine alongside conventional treatment of metformin. The extract mixture contained many highly potent compounds for treating T2DM and preventing short- and long-term risk complications of diabetes. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Optimal glucose-lowering strategies in patients with both heart failure (HF) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) are not well defined, particularly as novel medication classes emerge. We sought to evaluate current patterns of glucose-lowering medication use in adults with T2D with and without HF.

   METHODS: The DCR is a US-based outpatient registry of adults with diabetes; currently includes 3074 providers in 203 practices. We used hierarchical, modified Poisson regression models to examine the relationship between concomitant HF with use of each glucose-lowering medication class, adjusting for other factors that could impact selection of one medication class over another: age, chronic kidney disease (CKD), coronary artery disease (CAD), number of glucose-lowering medications, and insurance.

   RESULTS: Among 456,106 adults with T2D, 125,161 (27%) had a diagnosis of HF (30% HFrEF, 15%HFmrEF, 55% HFpEF). Patients with T2D and HF were more likely to be older and male, and to have CAD, atrial fibrillation, and CKD. In the multivariable models, HF was associated with a greater use of insulin (RR 1.39, 95% CI 1.36-1.42) and lower use of thiazolidinediones (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.74-0.83), SGLT2 inhibitors (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.79-0.89), and metformin (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.82-0.86). Among the subgroup of patients with HF, thiazolidinediones, GLP-1 receptor agonists, and SGLT2 inhibitors were used even less often in patients with lower ejection fraction, indicating that both the diagnosis of clinical HF and ejection fraction may influence the choice of glucose-lowering medications.

   CONCLUSION: In a large US-based outpatient registry, we found that a quarter of adults with T2D had a diagnosis of HF, which was predominantly HFpEF. Although certain T2D medication use in patients with HF appeared consistent with evidence (less use of thiazolidinediones), others appeared contrary to evidence (less use of metformin and SGLT2 inhibitors).

Abstract
  AIMS: Metformin treatment is associated with a decrease of serum vitamin B12, but whether this reflects tissue B12 deficiency is controversial. We studied the effects of metformin on serum levels of methylmalonic acid (MMA), a biomarker for tissue B12 deficiency, and on onset or progression of neuropathy.

   METHODS: In the HOME trial, 390 insulin-treated patients with type 2 diabetes were treated with metformin or placebo for 52months. In a post hoc analysis, we analyzed the association between metformin, MMA and a validated Neuropathy Score (NPS).

   RESULTS: Metformin vs placebo increased MMA at the end of the study (95%CI: 0.019 to 0.055, p=0.001). Mediation analysis showed that the effect of metformin on the NPS consisted of a beneficial effect through lowering HbA1c (-0.020 per gram year) and an adverse effect through increasing MMA (0.042 per gram year), resulting in a non-significant net effect (0.032 per gram year, 95% CI: -0.121 to 0.182, p=0.34).

   CONCLUSION: Metformin not only reduces serum levels of B12, but also progressively increases serum MMA. The increase of MMA in metformin users was associated with significant worsening of the NPS. These results provide further support that metformin-related B12 deficiency is clinically relevant. Monitoring of B12 in users of metformin should be considered. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Saxagliptin as one of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors can effectively improve glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus, and nesfatin-1 is regarded as a very important factor in regulating feeding behavior and energy homeostasis. In this trial, we observed the effect of saxagliptin on regulating nesfatin-1 secretion and ameliorating insulin resistance and metabolic profiles in type 2 diabetes mellitus.

   METHODS: One hundred two type 2 diabetes participants (M/F = 48/54) were investigated. Fifty-one (M/F = 24/27) of them as the treatment group were treated with oral glucose-lowering agents including saxagliptin, the other 51 (M/F = 24/27) as the control group were treated with oral glucose-lowering agents excluding any DPP-4 inhibitors. The parameters of serum nesfatin-1, C-peptide, homeostasis model assessment-beta (HOMA-beta) function, HOMA insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), body mass index (BMI), and blood pressure (BP) at baseline, month 3, 6, and 12 were observed and compared respectively.

   RESULTS: Saxagliptin significantly upregulated nesfatin-1 secretion (P < 0.001 at 3-, 6-, and 12-months vs. baseline), increased serum C-peptide (P < 0.05, 0.001, and 0.001 at 3-, 6-, and 12-months vs. baseline), improved HOMA-IR and function of HOMA-beta (P < 0.001 at 3-, 6-, and 12-months vs. baseline) and metabolic profiles (P < 0.001 with HbA1c at 3-, 6- and 12-months; P < 0.001 with LDL-C at 6- and 12-months; P < 0.001 and 0.01 with HDL-C at 6- and 12-months vs. baseline), declined BMI (P < 0.05 at 6- and 12-months vs. baseline) and BP (P < 0.001 with systolic BP (SBP), and mean BP at 6- and 12-months, P < 0.01 with diastolic BP at 6- and 12-months vs. baseline).

   CONCLUSIONS: Saxagliptin could upregulate nesfatin-1 secretion and ameliorate insulin resistance and metabolic profiles in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Saxagliptin had the potential to play fundamental by upregulating nesfatin-1 secretion besides lowering glucose by inhibiting the degradation of glucagon-like peptide-1.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Glucokinase acts as a glucose sensor in the pancreas and a glucose processor in the liver, and has a central role in glucose homoeostasis. Dorzagliatin is a new, dual-acting, allosteric glucokinase activator that targets both pancreatic and hepatic glucokinases. Dorzagliatin has good pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties in humans, and provides effective 24-h glycaemic control and improves glucose sensitivity in patients with type 2 diabetes. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of dorzagliatin monotherapy at different doses in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes.

   METHODS: In this multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 study, we randomly assigned (1:1:1:1:1) patients to receive oral placebo or one of four doses of oral dorzagliatin (75 mg once a day, 100 mg once a day, 50 mg twice a day, or 75 mg twice a day) using permuted-block randomisation, with a block size of ten and without stratification. Eligible patients were men or non-fertile women (aged 40-75 years) with type 2 diabetes who had a BMI of 19.0-30.0 kg/m2, were on a diet and exercise regimen, and were previously untreated or treated with metformin or alpha-glucosidase inhibitor monotherapy. The study started with a 4-week placebo run-in period followed by a 12-week treatment period. The primary endpoint was the change in HbA1c from baseline to week 12, which was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug and had both baseline and at least one post-baseline HbA1c value. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02561338.

   FINDINGS: Between Sept 29, 2015, and Aug 17, 2016, we randomly assigned 258 patients to one of the five study groups. At the end of 12 weeks, the least squares mean change in HbA1c from baseline was -0.35% (95% CI -0.60 to -0.10) in the placebo group, -0.39% (-0.64 to -0.14) in the 75 mg once daily group, -0.65% (-0.92 to -0.38) in the 100 mg once daily group, -0.79% (-1.06 to -0.52) in the 50 mg twice daily group, and -1.12% (-1.39 to -0.86) in the 75 mg twice daily group. Compared with the placebo group, the change in HbA1c between baseline and 12 weeks was significant in the 50 mg twice daily (p=0.0104) and the 75 mg twice daily (p<0.0001) groups. The number of adverse events was similar between the treatment groups and the placebo group. There were no reports of drug-related serious adverse events or severe hypoglycaemia.

   INTERPRETATION: Dorzagliatin had a beneficial effect on glycaemic control and was safe and well tolerated over 12 weeks in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: Introduction: The paper presents the findings of our own study on the changes of the systemic inflammation in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) and ischemic heart disease (IHD) during the combination treatment with metformin and pioglitazone. The aim of the paper is to define the dynamics of the systemic inflammation in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and ischemic heart disease in combination treatment with metformin and pioglitazone.

   PATIENTS AND METHODS: Meterials and methods: 95 patients with IHD concomitant with DM2 have been treated. Patients, enrolled into study, have been randomized into 2 groups: the comparison group (n=37) treated with metformin andsulphonylureas, and the study group (n=58) treated with metformin and pioglitazone. The proposed course of therapy lasted 6 months.

   RESULTS: Results and conclusions: Before, after 3 and 6 months of treatment the control over the state of inflammatory responses was made and C-reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, Interleukin-6 was assessed. The resulting data confirmed a statistically significant reduction under the effect of the combined treatment with the proposed combination of marker drugs and the degree of chronic systemic inflammation that is specific for IHD and DM2, which has a positive impact on the development and progress of IHD in DM2 patients, is well tolerated and can be considered as a pathogenic factor in the therapy of the presented comorbid nosologies.

Abstract
  Cardiovascular mortality is the primary cause of death in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Recently, clinical trials of the sodium-glucose transport protein 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors empagliflozin and canagliflozin and of the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists liraglutide and semaglutide demonstrated that the agents reduced cardiovascular events. Furthermore, empagliflozin and liraglutide reduced cardiovascular mortality. However, despite the proven cardiac benefits, many but not all provincial formularies have restrictive rules for payment and access for SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 agonists. These restrictions impede a practitioner's ability to provide optimal care for patients with T2DM and cardiovascular disease. The 2018 Diabetes Canada Guidelines recommend the use of a glucose-lowering agent with proven cardiovascular benefit (ie, empagliflozin, canagliflozin, liraglutide, or semaglutide) as second-line therapy after metformin, for patients with T2DM and cardiovascular disease who fail to achieve the glycemic target of A1C <7% with metformin. We recognize that provinces must allot resources especially when health care budgets are limited and not able to provide all available treatments. However, today we have glucose-lowering agents that reduce mortality in patients at very high cardiovascular risk. Furthermore, for empagliflozin, the cost effectiveness is highly favourable. Consequently, we urge provincial formularies to re-examine the access requirements for SGLT-2 inhibitors and to consider adding GLP-1 agonists use to reflect current evidence and clinical guideline recommendations.

Abstract
  PURPOSE: Metformin is commonly prescribed for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. We hypothesized that metformin plus androgen deprivation therapy may be beneficial in combination. Our objective was to assess this combination in a retrospective cohort of patients with advanced prostate cancer.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using national Veterans Affairs databases we identified all men diagnosed with prostate cancer between 2000 and 2008 who were treated with androgen deprivation therapy with followup through May 2016. Study exclusions included treatment with androgen deprivation therapy for 6 months or longer, or receipt of androgen deprivation therapy concurrently with localized radiation. Three patient cohorts were developed, including no diabetes mellitus, diabetes mellitus with no metformin and diabetes mellitus with metformin. Cox proportional HRs were calculated for overall survival, skeletal related events and cancer specific survival.

   RESULTS: After exclusions the cohort consisted of 87,344 patients, including 61% with no diabetes mellitus, 22% with diabetes mellitus and no metformin, and 17% with diabetes mellitus on metformin. Cox proportional hazard analysis of overall survival showed improved survival in men with diabetes mellitus on metformin (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.78-0.86) compared to those with diabetes mellitus who were not on metformin (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.99-1.08). The reference group was men with no diabetes mellitus. Cox proportional hazard analysis of predictors of skeletal related events revealed a HR of 0.82 (95% CI 0.72-0.93) in men with diabetes mellitus on metformin. Cox proportional hazard analysis of cancer specific survival showed improved survival in men with diabetes mellitus on metformin (HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.64-0.77) vs those with diabetes mellitus without metformin (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.85- 1.00). The reference group was men with no diabetes mellitus.

   CONCLUSIONS: Metformin use in veterans with prostate cancer who receive androgen deprivation therapy is associated with improved oncologic outcomes. This association should be evaluated in a prospective clinical trial. Copyright © 2018 American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  Men with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity are often characterised by low testosterone (T). We aimed to determine whether exenatide (EXE) combined metformin (MET) treatment has a better effect on serum total testosterone (TT) levels than glimepiride (GLI) combined MET treatment in men with T2D and obesity. In a multicentre, 12-week observational study, 176 obese T2D men with failed glycaemic control were included in the study: ninety men (mean age, 43.00 +/- 8.50 years) in EXE + MET group and 86 men (mean age, 44.00 +/- 7.00 years) in GLI + MET group. Serum TT levels were more significantly increased in EXE + MET group than GLI + MET group (121.72 +/- 56.73 ng/dl versus 34.67 +/- 16.30 ng/dl). The increasement of TT levels in those patients who lost body weight >=5% was significantly greater than those who lost weight <5% in the two groups. The changes in TT levels are closely related to the changes in waist circumference (r = -.443, p < .001). Sexual function assessment of EXE + MET group was more significantly improved than GLI + MET group (p < .001). No serious adverse events were observed. In conclusion, short-term combined treatment with EXE and MET is superior to GLI combined MET treatment in the improvement of serum TT levels, which could lead to an improvement of sexual hypofunction in patients with obesity and T2D.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: Accumulating data from recent studies has altered the gold standard of care for diabetes treatment. In patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and established cardiovascular disease (CVD) or those at high risk for CVD, subsequently to lifestyle changes and metformin therapy, the administration of an SGLT-2 inhibitor with established benefits for cardiovascular outcome (CVOT) should be considered. Areas covered: Tofogliflozin is the most selective SGLT-2 inhibitor and has been approved for the treatment of T2D in Japan. This review summarizes the available data on Tofogliflozin as compared to other SGLT-2 inhibitors, and primarily the three SGLT-2 inhibitors with published CVOT: Empagliflozin, Canagliflozin and Dapagliflozin. Expert opinion: Tofogliflozin's higher selectivity profile increases the positive effects on cardiovascular (CV) outcomes and death and reduces side effects. However, the clinical data on Tofogliflozin from both clinical and real-world studies remain sparse and much less abundant than the other main 3 SGLT-2 inhibitors, thus calling for caution and underscoring the need for further research.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: Introduction: Long-term systemic inflammation may cause type 2 diabetes. Medications used to treat type 2 diabetes don't target inflammation therefore it's necessary to study how hypoglycemics can improve patient prognosis through modification of systemic inflammation. The aim: Our goal was to assess influence of liraglutide in complex therapy on proinflammatory cytokine levels in overweight patients with type 2 diabetes and compare it with metformin.

   PATIENTS AND METHODS: Meterials and methods: The study included 80 overweight patients with type 2 diabetes. We studied clinical parameters as well as antropometric: height, weight, BMI, abdomen circumference; hsCRP, proinflammatory cytokine (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6) levels. Patients were treated according to an individualized treatment plan which included eating habit modification and dosed physical exercise. First and second groups were comparison groups. Patients in the first group received metformin as primary treatment up to 2500 mg/day (n=20). Patients in the second group received liraglutide up to 1.8 mg/day (n=30). Patients in the third (main) group received a combination of metformin (up to 2500 mg/day) and liraglutide up to 1.8 mg/day (n=30).

   RESULTS: Results and conclusions: Main group achieved a decrease in BMI from 28,48+/-2,1 kg/m2 to 23,9+/-1,8 kg/m2 (p<0,05), whereas such decrease in the liraglutide monotherapy group was from 28,59+/-2,5 kg/m2 to 25,87+/-2,3 kg/m2 (p<0,05) and from 28,65+/-3,2 kg/m2 to 27,46+/-2,8 kg/m2 (p>0,05) in the metformin monotherapy group. Liraglutide was more efficient in lowering inflammatory cytokine concentrations with TNF-alpha and IL-6 being more sensitive to its effects. Main group saw a decrease in TNF-alpha levels from 10,14+/-0,6 to 7,49+/-0,33 pg/ml (<0,001) and IL-6 levels from 11,12+/-0,7 to 7,84+/-0,62 pg/ml (<0,001).

Abstract
  AIM: To compare the efficacy and safety of the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor sitagliptin with the sodium-glucose transporter-2 inhibitor dapagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes and mild renal insufficiency.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with HbA1c >=7.0 to <=9.5% (>=53 to <=80 mmol/mol) and estimated glomerular filtration rate >=60 to <90 mL/min/1.73m2 on metformin (>=1500 mg/d) +/- sulfonylurea were randomized to sitagliptin 100 mg (n = 307) or dapagliflozin 5 mg titrated to 10 mg (n = 306) once daily for 24 weeks. A longitudinal data analysis model was used to test the primary hypothesis that sitagliptin is non-inferior to dapagliflozin in reducing HbA1c at Week 24, with superiority to be tested if non-inferiority is met. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02532855.

   RESULTS: Baseline mean HbA1c (% [mmol/mol]) was 7.7 (60.9) and 7.8 (61.2), and mean eGFR (mL/min/1.73m2 ) was 79.4 and 76.9 for the sitagliptin and dapagliflozin groups, respectively. After 24 weeks, the between-group difference in least squares mean (95% CI) changes from baseline in HbA1c was -0.15% (-0.26, -0.04) (-1.67 mmol/mol [-2.86, -0.48]), P = 0.006, meeting the prespecified criteria for declaring both non-inferiority and superiority of sitagliptin versus dapagliflozin. The HbA1c goal of <7% (<53 mmol/mol) was met by 43% (sitagliptin) and 27% (dapagliflozin) of patients. No meaningful between-group difference was observed in a pre-specified analysis of 2-hour incremental postprandial glucose excursion. A review of adverse events (AEs) was notable for a lower incidence of drug-related AEs with sitagliptin compared with dapagliflozin.

   CONCLUSIONS: In patients with type 2 diabetes, mild renal insufficiency and inadequate glycaemic control on metformin +/- sulfonylurea, sitagliptin treatment resulted in greater improvement in glycaemic control compared with dapagliflozin and was generally well tolerated.

Abstract
  AIM: To investigate whether tight glycaemic control achieved with metformin, insulin or sulphonylurea-based pharmacotherapy increases all-cause mortality in older people with type 2 diabetes.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of individuals with known diabetes recruited between 2008 and 2011 and followed until 2016. The impact of baseline glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) on mortality hazards was investigated in participants aged >=75 years. Proportional hazards models for time to death were constructed from the baseline clinical assessment, then the variables of interest (HbA1c, treatment category and their interactions) were entered.

   RESULTS: There were 367 participants (mean age 80.1 +/- 3.9 years, median [interquartile range] HbA1c 50 [45-56] mmol/mol or 6.7 [6.3-7.3]%) who were followed for a median (interquartile range) 6.7 (4.5-7.7) years, during which 40.9% of the participants died. At baseline, 60.4% were on metformin-based treatment, 35.3% on sulphonylurea-based treatment and 23.2% on treatment including insulin. Baseline HbA1c was significantly associated with mortality in a model that included interactions between HbA1c and the three treatment-based groups compared with non-pharmacological treatment. The metformin treatment group had higher mortality when HbA1c levels were <48 mmol/mol (<6.5%) and the sulphonylurea and insulin treatment groups had higher mortality when HbA1c levels were <52 mmol/mol (<7.0%), with hazard ratios of 2.63 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.39-4.97), 2.49 (95% CI 1.14-5.44) and 2.22 (95% CI 1.12-4.43), respectively.

   CONCLUSIONS: Tight glycaemic control may be hazardous in older people with type 2 diabetes when achieved with pharmacotherapy with metformin, and especially with insulin or sulphonylureas. These data confirm that overtreatment is likely to be an important clinical problem in this vulnerable population. Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Abstract
  AIM: To report results at week 208, including a 104-week masked extension, of the EMPA-REG H2H-SU trial in patients with type 2 diabetes with inadequate glycaemic control on metformin, in which empagliflozin 25 mg given for 104 weeks provided a sustained reduction in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) with a small but statistically significant benefit vs glimepiride, sustained reductions in weight and blood pressure, and low risk of hypoglycaemia.

   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients with type 2 diabetes and HbA1c 53-86 mmol/mol (7% to 10%) were randomized to empagliflozin 25 mg or glimepiride 1 to 4 mg for 104 weeks as add-on to metformin. Patients who completed the randomized treatment period could participate in a 104-week extension in which they continued the double-blind treatment allocated at randomization.

   RESULTS: Of 765 and 780 patients treated with empagliflozin and glimepiride, 576 and 549 patients, respectively, entered the extension period of the study. At week 208, the adjusted mean difference in change from baseline in HbA1c with empagliflozin vs glimepiride was -1.96 mmol/mol, 95% CI -3.57, -0.35 (-0.18%, 95% CI -0.33, -0.03); P = 0.0172. Rescue therapy was given to 23% of patients on empagliflozin and 34% on glimepiride (odds ratio 0.56 [95% CI 0.45, 0.71]; P < 0.0001). Confirmed hypoglycaemic adverse events (plasma glucose <=3.9 mmol/L and/or requiring assistance) occurred in 3% of patients on empagliflozin and 28% on glimepiride (odds ratio 0.08 [95% CI 0.05, 0.13]; P < 0.0001).

   CONCLUSIONS: In patients with type 2 diabetes, empagliflozin 25 mg as add-on to metformin for 208 weeks reduced HbA1c with a significantly lower risk of hypoglycaemia and a significantly smaller proportion of patients receiving rescue therapy compared with glimepiride.

Abstract
  AIM: To confirm non-inferiority of biphasic insulin aspart 30 (BIAsp 30) plus metformin to BIAsp 30 in lowering glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) in Chinese patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes using oral antidiabetic drugs.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this 16-week, prospective, randomized, open-label, multicentre, parallel-controlled study, patients aged 18-79 years with HbA1c >=7% were randomized to BIAsp 30 plus metformin (n = 130) or BIAsp 30 (n = 127). Initially, 500 mg metformin was administered twice daily and BIAsp 30 was administered at 0.2-0.3 U/kg/d. Changes in HbA1c % from baseline to week 16 as well as secondary and safety endpoints were assessed.

   RESULTS: In total, 83.66% of patients in the BIAsp 30 plus metformin (n = 110) and the BIAsp 30 (n = 105) groups completed the study. Mean (+/-standard deviation) change in HbA1c from baseline to endpoint was -1.74 +/- 1.64% and -1.32 +/- 2.05% with BIAsp 30 plus metformin and BIAsp 30, respectively. Least squares mean treatment difference was -0.67% (95% CI, -1.06; -0.28). The upper limit of the 95% CI was <0.4 (non-inferiority margin). A significantly higher proportion of individuals reached HbA1c <7% with BIAsp 30 plus metformin than with BIAsp 30 (53.15% vs 35.19%; P = 0.0074). At endpoint, daily BIAsp 30 dose (P < 0.001) and weight gain were significantly lower (P < 0.05) in the BIAsp 30 plus metformin group compared with the BIAsp 30 group. No between-group differences in number of hypoglycaemic events were observed.

   CONCLUSION: BIAsp 30 plus metformin was non-inferior to BIAsp 30 in safely reducing HbA1c in this study. Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: The number of people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is increasing worldwide. The combination of metformin and sulphonylurea (M+S) is a widely used treatment. Whether M+S shows better or worse effects in comparison with other antidiabetic medications for people with T2DM is still controversial.

   OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of metformin and sulphonylurea (second- or third-generation) combination therapy for adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

   SEARCH METHODS: We updated the search of a recent systematic review from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). The updated search included CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP. The date of the last search was March 2018. We searched manufacturers' websites and reference lists of included trials, systematic reviews, meta-analyses and health technology assessment reports. We asked investigators of the included trials for information about additional trials.

   SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) randomising participants 18 years old or more with T2DM to M+S compared with metformin plus another glucose-lowering intervention or metformin monotherapy with a treatment duration of 52 weeks or more.

   DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors read all abstracts and full-text articles and records, assessed risk of bias and extracted outcome data independently. We used a random-effects model to perform meta-analysis, and calculated risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes, using 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for effect estimates. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE instrument.

   MAIN RESULTS: We included 32 RCTs randomising 28,746 people. Treatment duration ranged between one to four years. We judged none of these trials as low risk of bias for all 'Risk of bias' domains. Most important events per person were all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, serious adverse events (SAE), non-fatal stroke (NFS), non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) and microvascular complications. Most important comparisons were as follows:Five trials compared M+S (N = 1194) with metformin plus a glucagon-like peptide 1 analogue (N = 1675): all-cause mortality was 11/1057 (1%) versus 11/1537 (0.7%), risk ratio (RR) 1.15 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49 to 2.67); 3 trials; 2594 participants; low-certainty evidence; cardiovascular mortality 1/307 (0.3%) versus 1/302 (0.3%), low-certainty evidence; serious adverse events (SAE) 128/1057 (12.1%) versus 194/1537 (12.6%), RR 0.90 (95% CI 0.73 to 1.11); 3 trials; 2594 participants; very low-certainty evidence; non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) 2/549 (0.4%) versus 6/1026 (0.6%), RR 0.57 (95% CI 0.12 to 2.82); 2 trials; 1575 participants; very low-certainty evidence.Nine trials compared M+S (N = 5414) with metformin plus a dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 inhibitor (N = 6346): all-cause mortality was 33/5387 (0.6%) versus 26/6307 (0.4%), RR 1.32 (95% CI 0.76 to 2.28); 9 trials; 11,694 participants; low-certainty evidence; cardiovascular mortality 11/2989 (0.4%) versus 9/3885 (0.2%), RR 1.54 (95% CI 0.63 to 3.79); 6 trials; 6874 participants; low-certainty evidence; SAE 735/5387 (13.6%) versus 779/6307 (12.4%), RR 1.07 (95% CI 0.97 to 1.18); 9 trials; 11,694 participants; very low-certainty evidence; NFS 14/2098 (0.7%) versus 8/2995 (0.3%), RR 2.21 (95% CI 0.74 to 6.58); 4 trials; 5093 participants; very low-certainty evidence; non-fatal MI 15/2989 (0.5%) versus 13/3885 (0.3%), RR 1.45 (95% CI 0.69 to 3.07); 6 trials; 6874 participants; very low-certainty evidence; one trial in 64 participants reported no microvascular complications were observed (very low-certainty evidence). Eleven trials compared M+S (N = 3626) with metformin plus a thiazolidinedione (N = 3685): all-cause mortality was 123/3300 (3.7%) versus 114/3354 (3.4%), RR 1.09 (95% CI 0.85 to 1.40); 6 trials; 6654 participants; low-certainty evidence; cardiovascular mortality 37/2946 (1.3%) versus 41/2994 (1.4%), RR 0.78 (95% CI 0.36 to 1.67); 4 trials; 5940 participants; low-certainty evidence; SAE 666/3300 (20.2%) versus 671/3354 (20%), RR 1.01 (95% CI 0.93 to 1.11); 6 trials; 6654 participants; very low-certainty evidence; NFS 20/1540 (1.3%) versus 16/1583 (1%), RR 1.29 (95% CI 0.67 to 2.47); P = 0.45; 2 trials; 3123 participants; very low-certainty evidence; non-fatal MI 25/1841 (1.4%) versus 21/1877 (1.1%), RR 1.21 (95% CI 0.68 to 2.14); P = 0.51; 3 trials; 3718 participants; very low-certainty evidence; three trials (3123 participants) reported no microvascular complications (very low-certainty evidence). Three trials compared M+S (N = 462) with metformin plus a glinide (N = 476): one person died in each intervention group (3 trials; 874 participants; low-certainty evidence); no cardiovascular mortality (2 trials; 446 participants; low-certainty evidence); SAE 34/424 (8%) versus 27/450 (6%), RR 1.68 (95% CI 0.54 to 5.21); P = 0.37; 3 trials; 874 participants; low-certainty evidence; no NFS (1 trial; 233 participants; very low-certainty evidence); non-fatal MI 2/215 (0.9%) participants in the M+S group; 2 trials; 446 participants; low-certainty evidence; no microvascular complications (1 trial; 233 participants; low-certainty evidence). Four trials compared M+S (N = 2109) with metformin plus a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor (N = 3032): all-cause mortality was 13/2107 (0.6%) versus 19/3027 (0.6%), RR 0.96 (95% CI 0.44 to 2.09); 4 trials; 5134 participants; very low-certainty evidence; cardiovascular mortality 4/1327 (0.3%) versus 6/2262 (0.3%), RR 1.22 (95% CI 0.33 to 4.41); 3 trials; 3589 participants; very low-certainty evidence; SAE 315/2107 (15.5%) versus 375/3027 (12.4%), RR 1.02 (95% CI 0.76 to 1.37); 4 trials; 5134 participants; very low-certainty evidence; NFS 3/919 (0.3%) versus 7/1856 (0.4%), RR 0.87 (95% CI 0.22 to 3.34); 2 trials; 2775 participants; very low-certainty evidence; non-fatal MI 7/890 (0.8%) versus 8/1374 (0.6%), RR 1.43 (95% CI 0.49 to 4.18; 2 trials); 2264 participants; very low-certainty evidence; amputation of lower extremity 1/437 (0.2%) versus 1/888 (0.1%); very low-certainty evidence.Trials reported more hypoglycaemic episodes with M+S combination compared to all other metformin-antidiabetic agent combinations. Results for M+S versus metformin monotherapy were inconclusive. There were no RCTs comparing M+S with metformin plus insulin. We identified nine ongoing trials and two trials are awaiting assessment. Together these trials will include approximately 16,631 participants.

   AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is inconclusive evidence whether M+S combination therapy compared with metformin plus another glucose-lowering intervention results in benefit or harm for most patient-important outcomes (mortality, SAEs, macrovascular and microvascular complications) with the exception of hypoglycaemia (more harm for M+S combination). No RCT reported on health-related quality of life.

  OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the association of serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels with platelet reactivity and antidiabetes treatment, as well as serum adipocytokine concentrations.

   METHODS: This observational, open-label study enrolled 149 patients. Serum BDNF, hematologic, biochemical parameters and platelet reactivity were measured. Blood samples were taken after the last acetylsalicylic acid dose.

   RESULTS: Patients with high BDNF levels were younger (65.60+/-8.956 vs. 68.59+/-8.516) and smoked cigarettes more frequently (14.6% vs. 4.1%); they were more commonly being treated by metformin (77.3% vs. 54%); had higher platelet counts (245.81+/-68.85 103/mm3 vs. 206.61+/-44.48 103/mm3); had shorter collagen-adenosine diphosphate closure time (CADP-CT) values (104.88+/-69.73 s vs. 140.93+/-86.63 s); had higher triglyceride concentrations (140.73+/-67.5 vs. 121.76+/-60.49) and had higher concentrations of serum thromboxane B2 (0.938+/-1.59 vs. 0.364+/-0.76). In univariate linear regression analyses, predictive factors for serum BDNF levels above the median were metformin treatment, current smoking, platelet count, triglyceride concentration, total cholesterol concentration and CADP-CT >74 s. In multivariate backward stepwise analysis CADP-CT >141 s; adiponectin concentration >4.22 microg/mL; total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein levels were independently associated with serum BDNF levels above the median.

   CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that BDNF may be associated with lipid metabolism and that increased production of BDNF may be related to metformin treatment. Moreover, we showed an association between BDNF levels and platelet reactivity; we found that serum BDNF levels in patients with type 2 diabetes who had high platelet reactivity were higher than in subjects with normal platelet reactivity despite antiplatelet therapy.

Abstract
  PURPOSE: Published data on the risk of bone fractures associated with medications used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus are summarized.

   SUMMARY: A systematic literature search identified 108 publications on controlled trials and 6 meta-analyses addressing the potential for fractures with the use of 7 commonly used antidiabetic classes: thiazolidinediones (TZDs), sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, biguanides, insulin, and sulfonylureas. Among all the classes of agents evaluated, only TZDs have been clearly linked to significantly increased fracture risk (number needed to harm [NNH], 99 in one meta-analysis and 172 in another meta-analysis) and only in female patients. Interim data from an ongoing large placebo-controlled trial suggest that use of the SGLT2 inhibitor canagliflozin may be associated with an elevated rate of fractures (absolute risk increase, 1.4%; NNH, 71) and decreased total-hip bone mineral density. Published data regarding the other evaluated classes of agents generally show no effect on fracture risk; some evidence suggests a small bone-protective effect with the use of DPP-4 inhibitors.

   CONCLUSION: In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, evidence is strongest that, among antidiabetic drugs, TZDs increase the risk of bone fractures; thus, TZDs should be used with caution in women. Canagliflozin is the only SGLT2 inhibitor linked to an increased fracture rate. Metformin, sulfonylureas, insulin, DPP-4 inhibitors, and GLP-1 agonists appear to have overall neutral effects on bone fractures.

Abstract
  PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to compare the adherence of the glimepiride/metformin sustained release (GM-SR) once-daily fixed-dose combination and glimepiride/metformin immediate release (GM-IR) BID fixed-dose combination in type 2 diabetes therapies.

   METHODS: An open-label, randomized, multicenter, parallel-group study was conducted at 11 hospitals in the Republic of Korea. A total of 168 patients with type 2 diabetes treated with >4 mg of glimepiride and 1000 mg of metformin by using free or fixed-dose combination therapy for at least 2 weeks were enrolled. Patients were randomized to receive GM-SR 4/1000 mg once-daily or GM-IR 2/500 mg BID for 24 weeks. Adherence was compared by using the Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS).

   FINDINGS: A significant difference in adherence was observed between the 2 groups. Overall adherence, defined by the number of container openings divided by the number of prescribed doses, was 91.7% in the GM-SR group and 88.6% in the GM-IR group (P < 0.001). The percentage of treatment days with the correct number of doses taken was 85.3% in the GM-SR group and 75.1% in the GM-IR group (P < 0.001). The percentage of missed doses was 11.7% in the GM-SR group and 15.3% in the GM-IR group (P < 0.001). The percentage of doses taken in the correct time window and therapeutic coverage were higher in the GM-SR group (P < 0.001). There was no significant difference in glycosylated hemoglobin changes or number of adverse events between the 2 groups. A total of 168 patients randomized to receive GM-SR once daily (86 patients) or GM-IR twice daily (82 patients). Mean Age were 57.8 +/- 9.6 years old. Male : female ratio was 47.6 : 52.4 %. Body mass index were 66.3 +/- 12.0 kg/m2, Diabetes duration were 10.5 +/- 6.6 years.

   IMPLICATIONS: This study showed that patient adherence with GM-SR once daily was significantly better than with GM-IR BID. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01620489. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier HS Journals, Inc. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: Sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) are recommended after metformin for a large spectrum of patients with type 2 diabetes, because of a favorable benefit/risk profile despite a variety of adverse events.

   AREAS COVERED: This narrative review discusses the safety profile of SGLT2is: initial concerns (cardiovascular safety, acute renal failure, hypoglycemia, urinary and genital infections, volume depletion, bladder cancer), further concerns (euglycemic ketoacidosis, bone fractures) and more recent concerns (lower limb amputation, Fournier's gangrene).

   EXPERT OPINION: Overall, the safety profile of SGLT2is is good. The only increased adverse event that was consistently reported in clinical trials and observational studies is genital mycotic infections, with only a borderline increase in urinary tract infections. Among clinical trials, only the CANVAS program reported an unexpected increase in bone fractures and peripheral amputations. A variety of rare adverse events have been described as case reports, including ketoacidosis, amputations and Fournier gangrene, which led to specific warnings by regulatory agencies. Identifying predisposing patient's characteristics and/or precipitating clinical conditions would help prevent the most severe complications. These adverse events should not mask the overall cardiovascular and renal benefit of SGLT2is, especially in patients with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk.

Abstract
  Context: It is unclear if effects of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and clinically available GLP-1 agonists on the heart occur at clinical doses in humans, possibly contributing to reduced cardiovascular disease risk.

   Objective: To determine whether liraglutide, at clinical dosing, augments myocardial glucose uptake (MGU) alone or combined with insulin compared with insulin alone in metformin-treated type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D).

   Design: In a randomized clinical trial of patients with T2D treated with metformin plus oral agents or basal insulin, myocardial fuel use was compared after 3 months of treatment with insulin detemir, liraglutide, or combination detemir plus liraglutide added to background metformin.

   Main Outcome Measures: Myocardial blood flow (MBF), fuel selection, and rates of fuel use were evaluated using positron emission tomography, powered to demonstrate large effects.

   Results: MBF was greater in the insulin-treated groups [median (25th, 75th percentile): detemir, 0.64 mL/g/min (0.50, 0.69); liraglutide, 0.52 mL/g/min (0.46, 0.58); detemir plus liraglutide, 0.75 mL/g/min (0.55, 0.77); P = 0.035 comparing three groups, P = 0.01 comparing detemir groups to liraglutide alone]. There were no evident differences among groups in MGU [detemir, 0.040 micromol/g/min (0.013, 0.049); liraglutide, 0.055 micromol/g/min (0.019, 0.105); detemir plus liraglutide, 0.037 micromol/g/min (0.009, 0.046); P = 0.68 comparing three groups]. There were no treatment-group differences in measures of myocardial fatty acid uptake or handling, and no differences in total oxidation rate.

   Conclusion: These observations argue against large effects of GLP-1 agonists on myocardial fuel metabolism as mediators of beneficial treatment effects on myocardial function and ischemia protection.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND & AIMS: Both green tea and metformin are used as adjuvants to treat and prevent complications associated with obesity; however, studies comparing their action and interaction in non-diabetic overweight women have not been reported. Thus, the current study evaluated the effects of green tea extract and metformin, both individually and in combination, on type 2 diabetes risk factors in non-diabetic overweight women.

   METHODS: A total of 120 overweight women were randomly assigned in a double-blind manner to 1 of 4 groups, as follows: control (n = 29; 1 g of cellulose), green tea (n = 32; 1 g of dry green tea extract), metformin (n = 28; 1 g of metformin), and green tea + metformin (n = 31; 1 g of dry green tea extract + 1 g of metformin). Each group took the indicated capsules daily for 12 weeks. Anthropometric measurements, body composition, and fasting blood samples were evaluated.

   RESULTS: Although no significant interactions were observed in glycaemic control (p = 0.07), green tea in the absence of metformin reduced fasting glucose (-4.428 +/- 2.00; p = 0.031), but when combined the lowering effect was nullified. In contrast, metformin increased HbA1c concentration (0.048 +/- 0.189%; p = 0.017) and also reduced body weight (-1.318 +/- 0.366 kg; p = 0.034) and LM (lean mass) (-1.249 +/- 0.310; p = 0.009). Regarding lipid parameters, green tea significantly reduced total cholesterol and LDL-c.

   CONCLUSIONS: Green tea was superior to metformin in improving glycaemic control and lipid profile in non-diabetic overweight women and, therefore, green tea extract is a promising alternative for reducing type 2 diabetes risk in overweight women.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: Discontinuation of metformin treatment in patients scheduled for elective coronary angiography (CAG) is controversial because of post-procedural risks including acute contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) and lactic acidosis (LA). This study aims to discuss the safety of continuing metformin treatment in patients undergoing elective CAG with normal or mildly impaired renal functions.

   METHODS: Our study was designed as a single-centered, randomized, and observational study including 268 patients undergoing elective CAG with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of >60 mL/min/1.73 m2. Of these patients, 134 continued metformin treatment during angiography, whereas 134 discontinued it 24 h before the procedure. CIN was defined as either a 25% relative increase in serum creatinine levels from the baseline or a 0.5 mg/dL increase in the absolute value that measured 48 h after CAG. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of CIN and LA after CAG.

   RESULTS: Both groups were comparable in terms of demographics and laboratory values. CIN at 48 h was 8% (11/134) in the metformin continued group and 6% (8/134) in the metformin discontinued group (p=0.265). Patients in neither of the groups developed metformin-induced LA. Based on multiple regression analysis, the ejection fraction [p=0.029, OR: 0.760; 95% CI (0.590-0.970)] and contrast volume [p=0.016, OR: 0.022 95% CI (0.010-0.490)] were independent predictors of CIN.

   CONCLUSION: Patients scheduled for elective CAG with normal or mildly impaired renal functions and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (>40%) may safely continue metformin treatment.

Abstract
  Importance: Approximately 1 million patients in the United States with type 2 diabetes mellitus and mild-to-moderate kidney disease do not receive guideline-directed therapy with metformin. This may reflect uncertainty regarding the risk of acidosis in patients with chronic kidney disease.

   Objective: To quantify the association between metformin use and hospitalization with acidosis across the range of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), accounting for change in eGFR stage over time.

   Design, Setting, and Participants: Community-based cohort of 75413 patients with diabetes in Geisinger Health System, with time-dependent assessment of eGFR stage from January 2004 until January 2017. Results were replicated in 67578 new metformin users and 14439 new sulfonylurea users from 2010 to 2015, sourced from 350 private US health systems.

   Exposures: Metformin use.

   Main Outcomes and Measures: Hospitalization with acidosis (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification code of 276.2).

   Results: In the primary cohort (n = 75413), mean (SD) patient age was 60.4 (15.5) years, and 51% (n = 38480) of the participants were female. There were 2335 hospitalizations with acidosis over a median follow-up of 5.7 years (interquartile range, 2.5-9.9 years). Compared with alternative diabetes management, time-dependent metformin use was not associated with incident acidosis overall (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.98; 95% CI, 0.89-1.08) or in patients with eGFR 45 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m2 (adjusted HR, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.95-1.41) and eGFR 30 to 44 mL/min/1.73 m2 (adjusted HR, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.83-1.44). On the other hand, metformin use was associated with an increased risk of acidosis at eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 (adjusted HR, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.33-3.22). Results were consistent when new metformin users were compared with new sulfonylurea users (adjusted HR for eGFR 30-44 mL/min/1.73 m2, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.29-2.05), in a propensity-matched cohort (adjusted HR for eGFR 30-44 mL/min/1.73 m2, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.45-1.12), when baseline insulin users were excluded (adjusted HR for eGFR 30-44 mL/min/1.73 m2, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.87-1.57), and in the replication cohort (adjusted HR for eGFR 30-44 mL/min/1.73 m2, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.37-2.01).

   Conclusions and Relevance: In 2 real-world clinical settings, metformin use was associated with acidosis only at eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2. Our results support cautious use of metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes and eGFR of at least 30 mL/min/1.73 m2.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: The burden of non-communicable diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) has drastically increased in developing countries over the years. Although recent evidence points to chronic immune activation to be a significant aspect in the pathogenesis and development of T2DM and CVDs, the exact role of T cells is not fully understood. Therefore, we aim to investigate T cell function and cardio vascular risk in T2DM. In addition, the therapeutic effect of blood glucose-lowering drugs to reverse hyperglycaemia induced T cell dysfunction and myocardial infarction will be reviewed.

   METHODS: This will be a systematic review and meta-analysis of published studies assessing T cell activation and cardiovascular risk in adults with T2DM. The search strategy will include medical subject headings (MeSH) words for PubMed/MEDLINE database. The search terms will also be adapted to grey literature, Embase and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials electronic databases. Studies will be independently screened by two reviewers using predefined criteria. Relevant eligible full texts will be screened and data will be extracted. Data extraction will be performed using a pre-piloted structured form. To assess the quality and strengths of evidence across selected studies, the Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation approach will be used. The Cochran's Q statistic and the I2 statistics will be used to analyse statistical heterogeneity between studies. If included studies show substantial level of statistical heterogeneity, a random-effects meta-analysis will be performed using R statistical software.

   DISCUSSIONS: This review will not require ethical approval, and the findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publication and conferences. Although other previous studies have reported deregulated T cell function in hyperglycaemia, the underlying mechanisms remain controversial. However, evidence suggests that T cells may be a key component in the development of T2DM and CVDs as its complication. Furthermore, they are a potential diagnostic and therapeutic target in the management of the disease.

Abstract
  After metformin monotherapy, the choice between a sulfonylurea and a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor may be critical in clinical practice. This article compares the cardiovascular safety of these two pharmacological classes based on meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials and observational studies. Both approaches show a better cardiovascular safety with DPP-4 inhibitors than with sulfonylureas. However, some heterogeneity exists, most probably explained by differences between the molecules, especially among sulfonylureas as those of last generation (more particularly gliclazide) seem to have a better safety profile. The ongoing head-to-head prospective trial CAROLINA compares the cardiovascular safety of glimepiride and linagliptin in high-risk patients, with results expected in 2019.
Other Abstract
  Publisher Apres la metformine, le choix entre un sulfamide hypoglycemiant ou un inhibiteur de la dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (iDPP-4 ou gliptine) se pose souvent en pratique clinique. Cet article compare la securite cardiovasculaire des deux classes a partir de meta-analyses d'essais cliniques randomises et d'etudes observationnelles. Les deux types d'approches montrent une meilleure securite cardiovasculaire avec les iDPP-4 qu'avec les sulfamides. Cependant, il existe une certaine heterogeneite, sans doute expliquee par des differences dans les molecules etudiees, en particulier dans la classe des sulfamides, ou ceux de derniere generation (gliclazide, notamment) paraissent avoir un meilleur profil de securite. L'etude CAROLINA, en cours, compare la securite cardiovasculaire du glimepiride et de la linagliptine, avec des resultats attendus en 2019. Language: French

Abstract
  Objective: Characterize the effectiveness of insulin glargine alone, exenatide alone, or combined in subjects taking stable doses of metformin and evaluate their impact on hemoglobin A1C, hypoglycemia, weight, and glucose variability. Methods: Open-label, randomized, parallel-arm study of adults with type 2 diabetes naive to both insulin and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) agonist who were not at A1C goal despite treatment with metformin. This prospective interventional study employed blinded continuous glucose monitoring ambulatory glucose profile (AGP) reports over 32 weeks. Subjects were randomized to treatment with glargine (Iglar), exenatide (GLP-1), or combination of glargine and exenatide (Iglar + GLP-1). At midpoint, those not at A1C target had the second medication added; those on Iglar + GLP-1 continued therapy optimization. Results: Decreases in A1C were: 7.6 to 6.2% for Iglar + GLP-1, 7.5 to 6.6% for Iglar, and 7.5 to 6.4% for GLP-1. Iglar + GLP-1 achieved A1C targets faster (14 to 16 weeks) but had more hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia rates increased slightly for all arms. Weight loss was achieved in all regimens including GLP-1. Glucose variability was not reduced to the same extent in the Iglar arm as the GLP-1 arm. Conclusion:  Addition of Iglar and/or GLP-1 to metformin for patients not at treatment goal was safe and effective. The order of medication addition needs to consider individualized AGP patterns and goals. Iglar + GLP-1 resulted in rapid A1C lowering, whereas GLP-1 was noted to have less hypoglycemia. Weight loss was most pronounced in GLP-1 monotherapy, suggesting that GLP-1 may mitigate the weight gain of Iglar. Any treatment with GLP-1 showed significant decreases in glucose variability.

Abstract
  In Japan, the choice of anti-diabetic medication is officially recommended according to the patient's glycemic condition and disease phenotype, unlike most other regions where metformin is recommended as the first-line medication. There has been an increase in the number of available glucose-lowering agents, making it necessary to select these agents based on ever-improving evidence obtained from clinical trials. For the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor class of drugs, nine drugs are currently available on the market in Japan. Although previous cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs) demonstrated non-inferiority for both major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) and safety for some drugs of the class, the design and results of the CARMELINA trial seemed to be slightly different from earlier trials in that it showed the drugs were safe and partially effective even in patients with renal impairment. Thus, recent CVOTs on newer glucose-lowering agents have mainly focused on the major impacts of individual classes and drugs on clinical outcomes behind their glucose-lowering action. The diverse features of the classes and individual drugs may have also highlighted not only the class-effects, but also the drug-effects of glucose-lowering agents. This will lead to clinical-based evidence and assist with optimum selection of the class and/or drug for tailored medication in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Diabetes Mellitus type 2 is very common worldwide, with majority of cases in Asia Pacific region. Metformin is the first line therapy, along with lifestyle modification for all type 2 diabetics as recommended by ADA. Metformin is available as conventional Metformin Immediate Release (MIR) and Metformin Extended Release (MXR). Metformin XR has better gastrointestinal tolerability and fewer side effects as compared to Metformin IR, with similar efficacy regarding anti-hyperglycaemic effects. The objective of this study was to determine whether metformin XR is as effective as Metformin IR in maintaining glycaemic control at equivalent doses or even at reduced doses; and to compare the side effect profile of the two preparations.

   METHODS: This randomized control trial was conducted at Medical and Endocrinology OPD of Jinnah Hospital Lahore. A total of 90 type 2 diabetics of both genders were recruited using nonprobability purposive sampling. Patients were randomized into 3 groups; 30 in each group. Group 1 received Metformin IR 1000 mg twice daily; group 2 received metformin XR 1000 mg twice daily; and group 3 received metformin XR 500 mg twice daily, for a period of three months. HbA1c was done at baseline and after three months of therapy along with fasting blood sugars and random blood sugars weekly.

   RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 46+/-9 years, with 54% being males and 46% being females. There was a 1% reduction in HbA1c in group 1, 0.7% reduction in group 2 and only 0.4% reduction in group 3. Similarly, all three therapies were equally effective in reducing blood sugar fasting and blood sugar random at three months. Side effects namely diarrhoea, dyspepsia and flatulence were greatest with Metformin IR (40%) but less than half with Metformin XR at equivalent dose and negligible at half the dose.

   CONCLUSIONS: All three Metformin groups were effective in reduction of HbA1C and glycaemic control clinically and there is no statistical difference in HbA1c reduction among groups at three months.

Abstract
  AIM: The present study assessed the effect of high intensity interval training on cardiac function during prolonged submaximal exercise in patients with type 2 diabetes.

   METHODS: Twenty-six patients with type 2 diabetes were randomized to a 12 week of high intensity interval training (3 sessions/week) or standard care control group. All patients underwent prolonged (i.e. 60 min) submaximal cardiopulmonary exercise testing (at 50% of previously assess maximal functional capacity) with non-invasive gas-exchange and haemodynamic measurements including cardiac output and stroke volume before and after the intervention.

   RESULTS: At baseline (prior to intervention) there was no significant difference between the intervention and control group in peak exercise oxygen consumption (20.3 +/- 6.1 vs. 21.7 +/- 5.5 ml/kg/min, p = 0.21), and peak exercise heart rate (156.3 +/- 15.0 vs. 153.8 +/- 12.5 beats/min, p = 0.28). During follow-up assessment both groups utilized similar amount of oxygen during prolonged submaximal exercise (15.0 +/- 2.4 vs. 15.2 +/- 2.2 ml/min/kg, p = 0.71). However, cardiac function i.e. cardiac output during submaximal exercise decreased significantly by 21% in exercise group (16.2 +/- 2.7-12.8 +/- 3.6 L/min, p = 0.03), but not in the control group (15.7 +/- 4.9-16.3 +/- 4.1 L/min, p = 0.12). Reduction in exercise cardiac output observed in the exercise group was due to a significant decrease in stroke volume by 13% (p = 0.03) and heart rate by 9% (p = 0.04).

   CONCLUSION: Following high intensity interval training patients with type 2 diabetes demonstrate reduced cardiac output during prolonged submaximal cardiopulmonary exercise testing. Ability of patients to maintain prolonged increased metabolic demand but with reduced cardiac output suggests cardiac protective role of high intensity interval training in type 2 diabetes.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin and dapagliflozin plus saxagliptin vs glimepiride as add-on to metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes.

   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This 52-week, multicentre, double-blind, active-controlled study (NCT02471404) randomized (1:1:1) patients (n = 939; HbA1c 7.5%-10.5%) on metformin monotherapy (>=1500 mg/day) to add-on dapagliflozin 10 mg, dapagliflozin 10 mg plus saxagliptin 5 mg, or glimepiride 1 to 6 mg (titrated). The primary efficacy end point was change in HbA1c from baseline to Week 52.

   RESULTS: Baseline mean age, diabetes duration and HbA1c were 58.4 years, 7.0 years and 8.3%, respectively. Adjusted mean HbA1c change from baseline was -1.20% with dapagliflozin plus saxagliptin and -0.82% with dapagliflozin, vs -0.99% with glimepiride (mean dose at Week 52, 4.6 mg). Changes in body weight (-3.2 kg and -3.5 kg vs +1.8 kg) and systolic blood pressure (SBP; -6.4 mm Hg and -5.6 mm Hg vs -1.6 mm Hg) were significantly greater with dapagliflozin plus saxagliptin and dapagliflozin than with glimepiride. FPG decreased significantly with dapagliflozin plus saxagliptin compared with glimepiride (-2.1 mmol/L vs -1.5 mmol/L) and was similar with dapagliflozin (-1.6 mmol/L) compared with glimepiride. Confirmed incidence of hypoglycaemia was lower with dapagliflozin regimens than with glimepiride (0 and 1 vs 13 patients) and fewer patients required rescue. Genital infections were more frequent with dapagliflozin; other AE profiles were similar.

   CONCLUSIONS: Dapagliflozin, saxagliptin and metformin improved glycaemic control compared with glimepiride plus metformin; add-on of dapagliflozin alone showed efficacy similar to that of glimepiride. Both dapagliflozin regimens decreased body weight and SBP, with a lower incidence of hypoglycaemia compared with glimepiride. Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

Abstract
  AIMS: To conduct a dose-response assessment of the efficacy and safety of the glucagon receptor antagonist PF-06291874 in adults with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) using stable doses of metformin.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, statin-stratified, placebo-controlled, 4-arm, parallel-group study was conducted in patients with T2DM who were receiving background metformin. After an 8-week, non-metformin oral antidiabetic agent washout period, 206 patients were randomized to placebo or PF-06291874 (30, 60 or 100 mg once daily) for 12 weeks. Glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and safety endpoints were assessed at baseline and post baseline.

   RESULTS: Dose-dependent mean reductions from baseline in HbA1c for PF-06291874 ranged from -0.67% (-7.29 mmol/mol) to -0.93% (-10.13 mmol/mol), and for FPG from -16.6 to -33.3 mg/dL after 12 weeks of dosing. The incidence of hypoglycaemia was low and was similar between groups receiving PF-06291874 and placebo. Small, non-dose-dependent increases in LDL cholesterol (<10%) and blood pressure (BP) (systolic BP > 2 mm Hg; diastolic BP > 1 mm Hg) were observed with PF-06291874. Modest non-dose-dependent median increases were observed across PF-06291874 groups at 12 weeks for alanine aminotransferase (range, 37.6-48.7 U/L vs placebo) and aspartate aminotransferase (range, 33.3-36.6 U/L vs placebo); these were not associated with bilirubin changes. Small increases were observed in body weight (< 0.5 kg) in each PF-06291874 group vs placebo.

   CONCLUSIONS: In patients with T2DM, PF-06291874 significantly lowered HbA1c and glucose, was well tolerated and carried a low risk of hypoglycaemia. Small, non-dose-related increases in BP, lipids and hepatic transaminases were observed. Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Abstract
  AIMS: To investigate the effects of semaglutide vs placebo on glucagon and other counterregulatory hormones during hypoglycaemia in type 2 diabetes (T2D).

   METHODS: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-centre trial, we randomized 38 men and women (treated only with metformin) 1:1 to 2 12-week crossover periods of once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide or placebo, each followed by a hypoglycaemic clamp procedure. The primary endpoint was change in glucagon concentration from target plasma glucose (PG) level 5.5 mmol/L to nadir (target 2.5 mmol/L).

   RESULTS: The mean (range) participant age was 54.2 (41-64) years, body mass index 29.4 (23.3-36.1) kg/m2 , glycated haemoglobin 60.8 (44.3-83.6) mmol/mol (7.7 [6.2-9.8]%), and diabetes duration 4.5 (0.3-13.2) years. A total of 35 participants completed the trial and were included in the analyses. During the hypoglycaemic clamp from 5.5 mmol/L PG to nadir, the absolute change in mean glucagon concentration was similar for semaglutide vs placebo: 88.3 vs 83.1 pg/mL (estimated difference 5.2 pg/mL [95% confidence interval -7.7 to 18.1]). Concentrations of other counterregulatory hormones increased with both treatments, with a statistically significantly lower increase for noradrenaline and cortisol with semaglutide vs placebo. The glucose infusion rate to maintain constant clamp levels was similar for each treatment group, suggesting an overall similar counterregulatory response. The mean hypoglycaemic symptom score and proportion of participants recognizing hypoglycaemia during the study were lower for semaglutide vs placebo treatment at nadir, but cognitive function test results were similar. No new safety issues were observed for semaglutide.

   CONCLUSIONS: Semaglutide treatment did not compromise the counterregulatory glucagon response during experimental hypoglycaemia in people with T2D. Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Abstract
  PURPOSE: This first-in-human study assessed safety, immunogenicity, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of RN909, a monoclonal antibody antagonist of the glucagon receptor, in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) subjects.

   METHODS: This study enrolled 84 T2DM subjects receiving stable metformin regimens. Forty-four subjects were randomized to receive single escalating doses of RN909 (0.3 to 6 mg/kg subcutaneously (SC), or 1 mg/kg intravenously (IV)), or placebo; 40 subjects were randomized to receive multiple escalating doses (50 to 150 mg SC) or placebo every 4 weeks for 12 weeks.

   RESULTS: RN909 was well tolerated; treatment-related elevated liver function tests (LFTs) were observed in 4/33 (12.1%) and 5/32 (15.6%) subjects treated with single and multiple doses, respectively, versus 1/10 (10%) and 0 in the respective placebo groups. RN909 dose-normalized AUCinf increased more than dose-proportionally following single SC doses, and after multiple doses, accumulation ratios ranged from 1.3 to 3.4. The incidence of antidrug antibodies (ADA) was 33% after single doses and 50% after multiple doses. RN909 produced dose-dependent, durable fasting plasma glucose (FPG)-lowering at day 29 (mean change -20.6 to -97.5 mg/dL) and day 85 (mean change; -27.2 to -43.5 mg/dL) after single and multiple doses, respectively. HbA1c also was reduced after single (mean change -0.30% to -1.44%), and multiple doses (-0.83% to -1.56%).

   CONCLUSION: RN909 was well tolerated after single and multiple doses in T2DM subjects, with diarrhea and elevated LFTs the most frequent adverse events. The appearance of ADA did not affect pharmacokinetics or efficacy. Robust lowering of FPG and HbA1c was observed.

Abstract
  Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a complex multifactorial disease due to the interaction between environmental noxae and genetic predisposition. Furthermore, an increased association between DM, especially Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and the onset of pulmonary function impairment with a bronchial hyperresponsiveness has been documented. DM is a risk factor for accelerated decline in FEV1 and the development of asthma and COPD. The increased blood glucose concentrations along with higher levels of oxidative stress and inflammation can influence the pulmonary function and, since hypoglycemic drugs can act on these different defects we can hypothesize their direct effect on obstructive pulmonary diseases. Metformin, a biguanide, is the molecule having several evidences of its action on asthma and COPD in patients with T2DM. In this population, Metformin can ameliorate pulmonary outcomes reducing high glucose concentrations, inflammation through the activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase, leading to the decreased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and blunting allergic eosinophilic airway inflammation. There are evidences of Pioglitazone role on asthma, since the activation of PPARgamma Pioglitazone might inhibit the synthesis and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Indeed, Pioglitazone can improve symptoms associated with asthma reducing episodes of exacerbation and oral steroid prescription. Finally, randomized clinical trials using hypoglycemic agents on patients with asthma and COPD with and without DM should be proposed as well as the implementation of a new formulation of hypoglycemic agents to make it possible to administer it via aerosol.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Fracture risk is increased in individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D). The pathophysiological mechanisms accentuating fracture risk in T2D are convoluted, incorporating factors such as hyperglycaemia, insulinopenia, and antidiabetic drugs. The objectives of this study were to assess whether different insulin regimens, metformin and rosiglitazone influence bone metabolism. We explored if the concentration of metformin and rosiglitazone in blood or improved glycaemic control altered bone turnover.

   METHODS: Two-year clinical trial designed to investigate effects of antidiabetic treatment in 371 T2D patients. Participants were randomized to short or long-acting human insulin (non-blinded) and then further randomized to metformin+placebo, rosiglitazone+placebo, metformin+rosiglitazone or placebo+placebo (blinded). Fasting bone turnover markers (BTM) representing bone resorption (CTX) and formation (PINP) including HbA1c were measured at baseline and after 3, 12 and 24months. Trough steady-state plasma concentrations of metformin and rosiglitazone were measured after 3, 6 and 9months of treatment. Associations between treatments and BTMs during the follow-up of the trial were analysed in mixed-effects models that included adjustments for age, gender, BMI, renal function and repeated measures of HbA1c.

   RESULTS: BTMs increased from baseline to month 12 and remained higher at month 24, with CTX and PINP increasing 28.5% and 23.0% (all: p<0.001), respectively. Allocation of insulin regimens was not associated with different levels of BTMs. Metformin and metformin+rosiglitazone but not rosiglitazone alone were associated with lower bone formation (PINP). Neither metformin nor rosiglitazone plasma concentrations was associated with BTMs. HbA1c was inversely associated with CTX but not P1NP.

   CONCLUSIONS: The choice of insulin treatment is not influencing BTMs, metformin treatment may decrease BTMs, and improvement of glycaemic control may influence bone resorption activity. Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  Ertugliflozin (Steglatro TM) is an orally active sodium glucose co-transporter type 2 inhibitor being developed by Merck and Pfizer as a treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Ertugliflozin as monotherapy and in combination with various other antidiabetic drugs was associated with improvements in glycaemic control and secondary outcome measures in the VERTIS phase III clinical trial program. Ertugliflozin and fixed-dose combinations of ertugliflozin and metformin (Segluromet TM) and ertugliflozin and sitagliptin (Steglujan TM) have recently been approved by the US FDA as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control in adults with T2DM. These products have also received a positive opinion from the EU Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). This article summarizes the milestones in the development of ertugliflozin leading to its first approval for T2DM.

Abstract
  The aim of the study was to assess whether a simple substitution of carbohydrate in the conventionally recommended diet with protein and fat would result in a clinically meaningful reduction in postprandial hyperglycaemia in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In all, sixteen subjects with T2DM treated with metformin only, fourteen male, with a median age of 65 (43-70) years, HbA1c of 6.5 % (47 mmol/l) (5.5-8.3 % (37-67 mmol/l)) and a BMI of 30 (sd 4.4) kg/m2 participated in the randomised, cross-over study. A carbohydrate-reduced high-protein (CRHP) diet was compared with an iso-energetic conventional diabetes (CD) diet. Macronutrient contents of the CRHP/CD diets consisted of 31/54 % energy from carbohydrate, 29/16 % energy from protein and 40/30 % energy from fat, respectively. Each diet was consumed on 2 consecutive days in a randomised order. Postprandial glycaemia, pancreatic and gut hormones, as well as satiety, were evaluated at breakfast and lunch. Compared with the CD diet, the CRHP diet reduced postprandial AUC of glucose by 14 %, insulin by 22 % and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide by 17 % (all P<0.001), respectively. Correspondingly, glucagon AUC increased by 33 % (P<0.001), cholecystokinin by 24 % (P=0.004) and satiety scores by 7 % (P=0.035), respectively. A moderate reduction in carbohydrate with an increase in fat and protein in the diet, compared with an energy-matched CD diet, greatly reduced postprandial glucose excursions and resulted in increased satiety in patients with well-controlled T2DM.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: The treatment of diabetes remains challenging over the decades, even after the introduction of numerous novel drugs of different classes. Most patients with type 2 diabetes require a combination of multiple agents and eventually the use of insulin. The newest antidiabetic drugs, possibly with the most pleiotropic actions after metformin are the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors (SGLT-2i). This class has a unique mechanism inhibiting the glucose reabsorption in the proximal tubule of the kidney.

   OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this review is to critically discuss the beneficial effect of SGLT-2i on glycemic control as monotherapy or in combination with other hypoglycemic agents.

   METHODS: A systematic review of randomised clinical trials on SGLT-2i vs placebo, other glucoselowering drugs or insulin was performed, and studies assessing glycemic control, mainly expressed through glycated hemoglobin and fasting plasma glucose levels (FPG) were included in the review. Electronic and manual searches on MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Library were performed.

   RESULTS: In our review, we mainly focused on dapagliflozin, empaglifozin and canagliflozin. All agents exhibited a sufficient reduction of HbA1c as well as FPG.

   CONCLUSIONS: SGLT-2i are a reliable second-line therapy of T2DM, since they can be combined safely with metformin, sulfonylures, incretin mimetics, insulin as well as in triple combinations. In many studies, they were prioritised as monotherapy with satisfying effects regarding HbA1c and FPG level reductions.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (AGI) reduce blood glucose levels and may thus prevent or delay type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and its associated complications in people at risk of developing of T2DM.

   OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of AGI in people with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), impaired fasting blood glucose (IFG), moderately elevated glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) or any combination of these.

   SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and the reference lists of systematic reviews, articles and health technology assessment reports. The date of the last search of all databases was December 2017.

   SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), with a duration of one year or more, comparing AGI with any pharmacological glucose-lowering intervention, behaviour-changing intervention, placebo or no intervention in people with IFG, IGT, moderately elevated HbA1c or combinations of these.

   DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors read all abstracts and full-text articles or records, assessed quality and extracted outcome data independently. One review author extracted data, which were checked by a second review author. We resolved discrepancies by consensus or involvement of a third review author. For meta-analyses we used a random-effects model with assessment of risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes, using 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for effect estimates. We assessed the overall quality of the evidence by using the GRADE instrument.

   MAIN RESULTS: For this update of the Cochrane Review (first published 2006, Issue 4) we included 10 RCTs (11,814 participants), eight investigating acarbose and two investigating voglibose, that included people with IGT or people "at increased risk for diabetes". The trial duration ranged from one to six years. Most trials compared AGI with placebo (N = 4) or no intervention (N = 4). Acarbose reduced the incidence of T2DM compared to placebo: 670 out of 4014 people (16.7%) in the acarbose groups developed T2DM, compared to 812 out of 3994 people (20.3%) in the placebo groups (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.89; P < 0.0001; 3 trials; 8008 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). One trial including participants with coronary heart disease and IGT contributed 64% of cases for this outcome. Acarbose reduced the risk of T2DM compared to no intervention: 7 out 75 people (9.3%) in the acarbose groups developed T2DM, compared to 18 out of 65 people (27.7%) in the no-intervention groups (RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.69; P = 0.004; 2 trials; 140 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Acarbose compared to placebo did not reduce or increase the risk of all-cause mortality (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.18; P = 0.86; 3 trials; 8069 participants; very low-certainty evidence), cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.71 to 1.10; P = 0.26; 3 trials; 8069 participants; very low-certainty evidence), serious adverse events (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.29; P = 0.13; 2 trials; 6625 participants; low-certainty evidence), non-fatal stroke (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.09 to 2.74; P = 0.43; 1 trial; 1368 participants; very low-certainty evidence) or congestive heart failure (RR of 0.87; 95% CI 0.63 to 1.12; P = 0.40; 2 trials; 7890 participants; low-certainty evidence). Acarbose compared to placebo reduced non-fatal myocardial infarction: one out of 742 participants (0.1%) in the acarbose groups had a non-fatal myocardial infarction compared to 15 out of 744 participants (2%) in the placebo groups (RR 0.10, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.53; P = 0.007; 2 trials; 1486 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Acarbose treatment showed an increased risk of non-serious adverse events (mainly gastro-intestinal events), compared to placebo: 751 of 775 people (96.9%) in the acarbose groups experienced an event, compared to 723 of 775 people (93.3%) in the placebo groups (RR 1.04; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.06; P = 0.0008; 2 trials; 1550 participants). Acarbose compared to no intervention showed no advantage or disadvantage for any of these outcome measures (very low-certainty evidence). One trial each compared voglibose with placebo (1780 participants) or diet and exercise (870 participants). Voglibose compared to placebo reduced the incidence of T2DM: 50 out of 897 participants (5.6%) developed T2DM, compared to 106 out of 881 participants (12%) in the placebo group (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.64; P < 0.0001; 1 trial; 1778 participants; low-certainty evidence). For all other reported outcome measures there were no clear differences between voglibose and comparator groups. One trial with 90 participants compared acarbose with diet and exercise and another trial with 98 participants reported data on acarbose versus metformin. There were no clear differences for any outcome measure between these two acarbose interventions and the associated comparator groups.None of the trials reported amputation of lower extremity, blindness or severe vision loss, end-stage renal disease, health-related quality of life, time to progression to T2DM, or socioeconomic effects.

   AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: AGI may prevent or delay the development of T2DM in people with IGT. There is no firm evidence that AGI have a beneficial effect on cardiovascular mortality or cardiovascular events.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Annually in the US, over 100,000 pregnant women with overt type 2 diabetes give birth. Strict maternal glycemic control is the key to optimizing infant outcomes. Medical treatment of type 2 diabetes in pregnancy is generally restricted to insulin, as data on the safety and efficacy of oral hypoglycemic agents in pregnancy are limited. However, over one-third of infants born to women with type 2 diabetes experience an adverse outcome, such as premature delivery, large-for-gestational age, hypoglycemia, hyperbilirubinemia, or birth trauma, suggesting that current treatment regimens fall short of optimizing outcomes. Metformin is the pharmacologic treatment of choice for type 2 diabetes outside of pregnancy. Metformin is favored over insulin because it results in less weight gain, fewer hypoglycemic episodes, and is administered orally rather than injected. However, metformin is not typically used for treatment of type 2 diabetes complicating pregnancy, mainly because no large clinical studies have been conducted to examine its use in this context.

   METHODS/DESIGN: This is a randomized double-blind multi-center clinical trial of insulin plus metformin versus insulin plus placebo for the treatment of type 2 diabetes complicating pregnancy. A total of 1200 women with type 2 diabetes will be randomized between 10 weeks 0 days' and 20 weeks 6 days' gestation and followed until 30 days after delivery. Neonate outcomes will be followed until 30 days of age. The primary aim is to compare the effect of insulin and metformin versus insulin and placebo on composite adverse neonatal outcomes, comprising perinatal mortality, preterm delivery, neonatal hypoglycemia, hyperbilirubinemia, large-for-gestational age small for gestational age, low birth weight, and/or birth trauma. Key secondary aims are to compare treatment groups for neonatal fat mass and rate of maternal hypoglycemia. Additional aims are to assess the side effects and safety of insulin and metformin among pregnant women with overt type 2 diabetes and to compare gestational weight gain among women treated with metformin plus insulin versus insulin alone.

   DISCUSSION: Successful completion of this study will result in high-quality, contemporary evidence for management of overt type 2 diabetes complicating pregnancy to improve neonatal outcomes.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVES: The objective of the study is to compare the efficacy of hypoglycaemic drugs for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) by network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

   METHODS: We compared 11 major oral hypoglycaemic drugs under five categories evaluated by RCTs as drug monotherapy for the patients with T2DM, measuring glycosylated haemoglobin (%) or fasting plasma glucose (mmol L-1 ) as outcomes. RCT quality was assessed with the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Network meta-analysis estimated the mean differences and 95% credible intervals. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed to determine the results robustness. The Grading of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation evidence strength was assessed.

   RESULTS: Seventy-five RCTs including 33,830 patients were identified. Their study quality was high. Regarding glycosylated haemoglobin, top three anti-diabetics were repaglinide (mean differences -1.39 [95% credible intervals -1.75 to -1.03]), gliclazide (-1.37 [-2.04 to -0.71]) and metformin (-1.13 [-1.37 to -0.90]), against placebo. Regarding fasting plasma glucose, top three anti-diabetics were repaglinide (-2.01 [-2.75 to -0.97]), metformin (-1.72 [-2.16 to -1.27]) and glipizide (-1.57 [-2.44 to -0.64]), against placebo. There was no difference between metformin and repaglinide. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses found the results to be robust. The evidence strength was moderate to high.

   CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis showed that repaglinide and metformin would be the most efficacious oral drugs for first-line monotherapy of T2DM. Copyright © 2018 World Obesity Federation.

Abstract
  Exenatide, metformin (MET), and biphasic insulin aspart 30 (BIA30) have been widely used in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM); however, each of these medications has significant adverse effects, which limit their utilization. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of triple combination (exenatide/metformin/biphasic insulin aspart) therapy for T2DM. Two hundred patients with poorly controlled T2DM were randomly divided into the low-dose (0.5 mug exenatide, 0.05 U.kg.d BIA30, and 0.01 g MET twice daily) and normal-dose (2 mug exenatide, 0.2 U.kg.d BIA30, and 0.05 g MET twice daily) groups for 48 weeks of treatment. Of note, 82 and 90 individuals from the low-dose and normal-dose groups, respectively, completed the study. The levels of adiponectin, C-reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and resistin were measured. The normal-dose treatment was more effective at lowering hemoglobin A1c levels than the low-dose therapy (HbA1c changes of -2.5 +/- 0.19% and -0.8 +/- 0.07%, respectively) after 48 weeks. The maximum weight decrease was 0.9 kg in the low-dose group and 4.0 kg in the normal-dose group. The triple combination therapy increased the levels of insulin sensitivity and adiponectin and reduced the levels of C-reactive protein, resistin, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. No significant difference in the adverse effects was found between the low-dose and normal-dose groups (P > 0.05). In conclusion, the investigated triple combination therapy for T2MD is therefore an effective and safe therapeutic strategy.

Abstract
  AIMS: Basal insulin plus oral hypoglycemic agents (OHAs) has not been investigated for early intensive antihyperglycemic treatment in people with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. This study is aimed at comparing the short-term (over a period of 12 days) effects of basal insulin glargine plus OHAs and continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) on glycemic control and beta-cell function in this setting.

   METHODS: An open-label parallel-group study. Newly diagnosed hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) >=11.1 mmol/L or glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) >=9% (75 mmol/mol) were randomized to CSII or insulin glargine in combination with metformin and gliclazide. The primary outcome measure was the mean amplitude of glycemic excursions (MAGE), and secondary endpoints included time to reach glycemic control target (FPG < 7 mmol/L and 2-hour postprandial plasma glucose < 10 mmol/L), markers of beta-cell function, and hypoglycemia.

   RESULTS: Subjects in the CSII (n = 35) and basal insulin plus OHA (n = 33) groups had a similar significant reduction from baseline to end of treatment in glycated albumin (-6.44 +/- 3.23% and- 6.42 +/- 3.56%, P = 0.970). Groups A and B have comparable time to glycemic control (3.6 +/- 1.2 days and 4.0 +/- 1.4 days), MAGE (3.40 +/- 1.40 mmol/L vs. 3.16 +/- 1.38 mmol/L; p = 0.484), and 24-hour mean blood glucose (7.49 +/- 0.96 mmol/L vs. 7.02 +/- 1.03 mmol/L). Changes in the C-peptide reactivity index, the secretory unit of islet in transplantation index, and insulin secretion-sensitivity index-2 indicated a greater beta-cell function improvement with basal insulin plus OHAs versus CSII.

   CONCLUSIONS: Short-term insulin glargine plus OHAs may be an alternative to CSII for initial intensive therapy in people with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: As initial combination therapy of metformin and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, the efficacy and safety for the use of high dose of metformin or low dose of metformin and the efficacy and safety for the combination use for Asian and Caucasian patients were not clear.

   METHODS: Double-blind randomized controlled trials comparing the efficacy of initial combination therapy of metformin and DPP-4 inhibitors with metformin monotherapy were included. The primary outcome was a result of comparisons between high-dose combination therapy and low-dose combination therapy in terms of efficacy and safety.

   RESULTS: A total of 11 studies were included. The results indicated that the high-dose combination therapy showed significant decreases in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) (-0.32%, P < 0.05), fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (-0.63 mmol/L, P < 0.05), and postprandial glucose (PPG) (-0.99 mmol/L, P < 0.05), but less increase in body weight (-0.54 kg, P < 0.05) when compared with low-dose combination therapy, corrected by metformin monotherapy. Moreover, the high-dose combination therapy exhibited significant decreases in HbA1c (-0.24%, P < 0.05), FPG (-0.54 mmol/L, P < 0.05), and PPG (-0.94 mmol/L, P < 0.05) in the Caucasian population than in the Asian population, corrected by metformin monotherapy.

   CONCLUSION: As an initial treatment, the high dose of metformin in combination with DPP-4 inhibitors not only provided better glycemic control but also had less effect on weight gain compared with the low-dose combination therapy through the correction of metformin monotherapy. Moreover, initial combination therapy in the Caucasian population showed better glycemic control and less increase in body weight compared with the Asian population.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) affects 9.4% of US adults and children, while another 33.9% of Americans are at risk of DM. Health care institutions face many barriers to systematically delivering the preventive care needed to decrease DM incidence. Community health workers (CHWs) may, as frontline public health workers bridging clinic and community, help overcome these challenges. This paper presents the protocol for a pragmatic, cluster-randomized trial integrating CHWs into two primary care clinics to support DM prevention for at-risk patients.

   METHODS: The trial will randomize 15 care teams, stratified by practice site (Bellevue Hospital and Manhattan VA), totaling 56 primary care physicians. The study cohort will consist of ~ 2000 patients who are 18-75 years of age, actively enrolled in a primary care team, able to speak English or Spanish, and have at least one glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) result in the prediabetic range (5.7-6.4%) since 2012. Those with a current DM diagnosis or DM medication prescription (other than metformin) are ineligible. The intervention consists of four core activities - setting health goals, health education, activation for doctor's appointments, and referrals to DM prevention programs - adjustable according to the patient's needs and readiness. The primary outcome is DM incidence. Secondary outcomes include weight loss, HbA1C, and self-reported health behaviors. Clinical variables and health behaviors will be obtained through electronic medical records and surveys, respectively. Implementation outcomes, namely implementation fidelity and physicians' perspectives about CHW integration into the clinic, will be assessed using interviews and CHW activity logs and analyzed for the influence of moderating organizational factors.

   DISCUSSION: This is the first rigorous, pragmatic trial to test the effectiveness of integrating CHWs into primary care for DM prevention reaching a population-based sample. Our study's limitations include language-based eligibility and the use of HbA1c as a measure of DM risk. It will measure both clinical and implementation outcomes and potentially broaden the evidence base for CHWs and patient-centered medical home implementation. Further, the intervention's unique features, notably patient-level personalization and referral to existing programs, may offer a scalable model to benefit patients at-risk of DM.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: Antidepressant medication use (ADM) has been shown to predict diabetes. This article assessed the role of inflammatory markers in this relationship within the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP).

   METHODS: DPP participants randomized to metformin (MET), life-style intervention (ILS), or placebo (PLB) were assessed for depression (Beck Depression Inventory [BDI]) annually, ADM use semiannually, serum inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein [CRP], interleukin 6 [IL-6]) at baseline and year 1, and diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) semiannually (for 3.2 years).

   RESULTS: At baseline (N = 3187), M (SD) body mass index was 34 (6) kg/m and the median (interquartile range) BDI score was 3 (1-7). One hundred eighty-one (5.7%) reported ADM use and 328 (10%) had BDI scores of 11 or higher. CRP and IL-6 levels did not differ by treatment group. Baseline ADM, but not BDI score, was associated with higher levels of baseline CRP adjusted for demographic, anthropometric variables, and other medications (20% higher, p = .01). Year 1 CRP decreased for non-ADM users in the MET (-13.2%) and ILS (-34%) groups and ADM users in the ILS group (-29%). No associations were found with IL-6. CRP and continuous use of ADM predicted incident T2DM in the PLB group. In the ILS group, continuous and intermittent ADM, but not CRP, predicted T2DM. In the MET group, CRP predicted incident T2DM. CRP did not mediate the risk of T2DM with ADM use in any group.

   CONCLUSIONS: ADM was significantly associated with elevated CRP and incident T2DM. In the PLB group, ADM and CRP independently predicted onset of T2DM; however, CRP did not significantly mediate the effect of ADM.

Abstract
  TOSCA.IT is an institutional, non-industry-supported, head-to-head study comparing long term cardiovascular effects, efficacy and safety of two antidiabetes drugs (pioglitazone vs sulphonylureas) used in combination with metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The study results show that in the absence of clinically evident cardiovascular disease both treatment strategies represent suitable alternatives; however, in consideration of the greater durability of the metabolic effects, the lower risk of hypoglycemia and the potential benefit on atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, the combination of metformin and pioglitazone may be considered as the preferential therapeutic option. In this review the study is critically evaluated against the background of the evidence accumulated over the last decade on the impact of different glucose lowering drugs on cardiovascular events in people with type 2 diabetes.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND AND AIMS: A potential causal relationship between thyroid function and type 2 diabetes mellitus is currently under debate, but the current state of research is limited. Our aim was to investigate the association of thyroid hormone levels with prevalent and incident type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in two representative studies.

   METHODS AND RESULTS: Analyses are based on data from the Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP), a German population based cohort with 4308 individuals at baseline and 3300 individuals at a five-year follow-up, and from INTER99, a Danish population-based randomized controlled trial with 6784 individuals at baseline and 4516 individuals at the five-year-follow-up. Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (fT4) concentrations were measured in both studies, while free triiodothyronine was measured in SHIP only. T2DM was defined by self report or intake of anti-diabetic medication. Neither in SHIP nor in INTER99 we detected significant associations of serum TSH levels with prevalent or incident T2DM. Serum fT4 levels were significantly positively associated with prevalent T2DM in SHIP and INTER99. In longitudinal analyses baseline levels of fT4 were significantly positively associated with incident T2DM in SHIP (RR per pmol/L = 1.07; 95%-CI = 1.05-1.10), while this association barely missed statistical significance in INTER99 (RR per pmol/L = 1.03; 95%-CI = 0.99-1.06). In SHIP baseline fT3 levels were significantly associated with incident T2DM (RR per pmol/L = 1.21; 95%-CI = 1.16-1.27).

   CONCLUSION: We demonstrated positive associations of thyroid hormones with prevalent and incident type 2 diabetes mellitus suggesting that hyperthyroxinemia may contribute to the pathogenesis of this condition.

Abstract
  AIMS/INTRODUCTION: We investigated the failure of monotherapy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in real practice settings.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Korean National Diabetes Program was a prospective, multicenter observational cohort study of type 2 diabetes mellitus patients in Korea. Of the 3,950 patients enrolled in the study, we studied 998 who were continuously maintained on monotherapy for at least 90 days at six participating centers. To balance the baseline characteristics of patients in each group, we used propensity matching at a 1:1 ratio (metformin vs sulfonylureas) and 4:1 ratio (metformin vs meglitinides and metformin vs alpha-glucosidase inhibitors [aGIs]). The hazard ratios (HRs) of treatments (compared with metformin) were determined by Cox's proportional hazards regression modeling.

   RESULTS: The median follow-up time was 56 months, and monotherapy failed in 45% of all patients. The annual incidences of failure were 15.6%, 21.3%, 27% and 9.6% in the metformin, sulfonylurea, meglitinide and aGI groups. Compared with metformin, sulfonylureas and meglitinides were associated with higher risks of monotherapy failure (HR 1.39, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.08-1.80; HR 1.92, 95% CI 1.13-3.27), and aGIs with risks similar to that of metformin (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.44-1.45). When analyzed by failure type, sulfonylureas, meglitinides and aGIs were associated with a higher risk of a switch to other agents (HR 4.43, 95% CI 2.14-9.17; HR 18.80, 95% CI 6.21-56.93; HR 4.25, 95% CI 1.49-12.13), and aGIs with a lower risk of prescription of add-on second agents (HR 0.16, 95% CI 0.04-0.64).

   CONCLUSIONS: Metformin was associated with a lower failure risk than were sulfonylureas and meglitinides, but a comparable aGI failure rate. Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

Abstract
  After failure of metformin monotherapy, another glucose-lowering agent should be added to improve glucose control. The clinician has several pharmacological choices, including the addition of a sulphonylurea (SU) or a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (DPP-4i). While the cardiovascular safety of SUs remains a matter of controversy, DPP-4is have proven their non-inferiority vs placebo in recent cardiovascular (CV) outcome trials. In the absence of a head-to-head CV outcome trial-the CAROLINA, comparing linagliptin with glimepiride, is still ongoing-only indirect information can be found in the literature to compare CV outcomes (major CV events, myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke, CV death and all-cause mortality) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) treated with SUs or DPP-4is. Thus, this comprehensive review summarizes the CV outcomes (excluding heart failure) reported in meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of SUs vs placebo or other glucose-lowering agents, DPP-4is vs placebo or other glucose-lowering agents and SUs vs DPP-4is in phase-II/III studies. Also, the results of observational studies reporting CV events in patients treated with either SUs or DPP-4is have been carefully examined. Overall, the CV safety of SUs appears to be poorer than that of DPP-4is in both RCTs and cohort studies. However, the results are somewhat disparate, and such heterogeneity may be explained by different patient characteristics across studies, but also perhaps by differences between various molecules in each pharmacological class. In particular, some doubt about a class effect affecting SU CV safety has been raised. The results of CAROLINA are expected to shed more light on SU CV concerns, especially compared with DPP-4is.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and measures of short-term glycemia do not fully capture daily patterns in plasma glucose dynamics. This study evaluated 24-h glycemic profiles in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) initiated on dapagliflozin treatment using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM).

   METHODS: This randomized double-blind placebo-controlled multicenter parallel-design 4-week study compared dapagliflozin (10 mg/d; n = 50) with placebo (n = 50) in adult patients with T2D uncontrolled (HbA1c 7.5%-10.5%) on either stable doses of metformin monotherapy (>=1500 mg/d) or insulin (>=30 U/d with or without up to two oral antidiabetes drugs). CGM was used to measure 24-h glycemic profiles for 7 days pretreatment and during week 4 of treatment. The primary outcome was change from baseline in 24-h mean glucose (MG) at week 4.

   RESULTS: The 24-h MG decreased 18.2 mg/dL with dapagliflozin and increased 5.8 mg/dL with placebo (P < 0.001). The proportion of time spent in the target glucose range (70-180 mg/dL) increased significantly with dapagliflozin versus placebo (69.6% vs. 52.9%; P < 0.001), with a small (0.3%) increase in time spent in the hypoglycemic range (<70 mg/dL), driven by those on background insulin therapy. Dapagliflozin reduced postprandial glucose and significantly decreased overall glucose variability. Few events of symptomatic hypoglycemia occurred. The most common adverse event was urinary tract infection (6% in each treatment arm).

   CONCLUSIONS: Compared with placebo, dapagliflozin improved measures of glycemic control and variability as assessed by CGM. Glycemic improvements were more pronounced in the group on background metformin than those receiving basal insulin.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: In type 2 diabetes mellitus therapy, fixed-dose combination (FDC) can offer not only benefits in glucose control via the combined use of agents, but also increase patient compliance. The aim of this study was to assess the pharmacokinetic equivalence of the high dose of the FDC tablet (gemigliptin/metformin sustained release [SR] 50/1,000 mg) and a corresponding co-administered dose of individual tablets.

   METHODS: This study was randomized, open-label, single dose, two treatments, two-period, crossover study, which included 24 healthy subjects. Subjects received the FDC or individual tablets of gemigliptin (50 mg) and metformin XR (1,000 mg) in each period. Geometric mean ratios (GMRs) and 90% confidence intervals (CIs) of maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to the time of the last quantifiable concentration (AUClast) of the FDC tablet and co-administration of individual tablet for both gemigliptin and metformin were calculated.

   RESULTS: The GMRs (FDC tablets/co-administration; 90% CIs) for Cmax and AUClast of gemigliptin were 1.079 (0.986-1.180) and 1.047 (1.014-1.080), respectively. For metformin, the GMRs for Cmax, and AUClast were 1.038 (0.995-1.083) and 1.041 (0.997-1.088), respectively. The 90% CIs for GMRs of Cmax and AUClast for gemigliptin and metformin fell entirely within bounds of 0.800-1.250. Both administration of FDC tablet and co-administration of individual tablets were well tolerated.

   CONCLUSION: FDC tablet exhibited pharmacokinetic equivalence and comparable safety and tolerability to co-administration of corresponding doses of gemigliptin and metformin XR as individual tablets. Trial registry at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02056600.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: Metformin use is restricted in patients with renal impairment due to potential excess systemic accumulation. This study evaluated the glycemic effects and safety of metformin delayed-release (Metformin DR), which targets metformin delivery to the ileum to leverage its gut-based mechanisms of action while minimizing systemic exposure.

   RESEARCH DESIGNS AND METHODS: Participants (T2DM [HbA1c 7-10.5%], eGFR >=60 mL/min/1.73m2, not taking metformin for >=2 months) were randomized to QD placebo (PBO); QD Metformin DR 600, 900, 1200, or 1500 mg; or to single-blind BID Metformin immediate-release (IR) 1000 mg. The primary endpoint was change in HbA1c for Metformin DR vs. PBO at 16 weeks in the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population (>= 1 post-baseline HbA1c while on study drug), using a mixed-effects repeated measures model.

   RESULTS: 571 subjects were randomized (56 years, 53% male, 80% white; BMI 32.2+/-5.5 kg/m2; HbA1c 8.6+/-0.9%; 51% metformin naive); 542 were in the mITT population. Metformin DR 1200 and 1500 mg significantly reduced HbA1c (-0.49+/-0.13% and -0.62+/-0.12%, respectively, vs. PBO -0.06+/-0.13%; p<0.05) and FPG (Caverage Weeks 4-16: -22.3+/-4.2 mg/dL and -25.1+/-4.1 mg/dL, respectively vs. -2.5+/-4.2 mg/dL p<0.05). Metformin IR elicited greater HbA1c improvement (-1.10+/-0.13%; p<0.01 vs. Placebo and all doses of Metformin DR) but with ~3-fold greater plasma metformin exposure. Normalizing efficacy to systemic exposure, glycemic improvements with Metformin DR were 1.5-fold (HbA1c) and 2.1-fold (FPG) greater than Metformin IR. Adverse events were primarily gastrointestinal but these were less frequent with Metformin DR (<16% incidence) vs. Metformin IR (28%), particularly nausea (1-3% vs 10%).

   CONCLUSION: Metformin DR exhibited greater efficacy per unit plasma exposure than Metformin IR. Future studies will evaluate the effects of Metformin DR in patients with type 2 diabetes and advanced renal disease.

Abstract
  AIM: To determine the influence of polymorphisms on the effects of metformin on HbA1c, daily dose of insulin and metformin plasma concentration. Methods: In a post hoc analysis of a 4.3 year placebo-controlled randomized trial with 390 patients with Type 2 diabetes already on insulin, we analyzed the influence of polymorphisms in genes coding for ATM and the transporters OCT1 and MATE1. Outcome measures were a combined HbA1c + daily dose of insulin Z score and metformin plasma concentrations.

   RESULTS: rs11212617 (ATM) was associated with an improved Z score and a lower metformin plasma concentration. In addition, the major allele of rs2289669 (MATE1) was also associated with an improved Z score.

   CONCLUSION: The ATM SNP rs11212617 significantly affected the effect of metformin and metformin plasma concentration. Further research is needed to determine the clinical importance of these findings, in particular the effects on metformin plasma concentration.

Abstract
  Type 2 diabetes mellitus and cancer are correlated with changes in insulin signaling, a pathway that is frequently upregulated in neoplastic tissue but impaired in tissues that are classically targeted by insulin in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Many antidiabetes treatments, particularly metformin, enhance insulin signaling, but this pathway can be inhibited by specific cancer treatments. The modulation of cancer growth by metformin and of insulin sensitivity by anticancer drugs is so common that this phenomenon is being studied in hundreds of clinical trials on cancer. Many meta-analyses have consistently shown a moderate but direct effect of body mass index on the incidence of multiple myeloma and lymphoma and the elevated risk of leukemia in adults. Moreover, new epidemiological and preclinical studies indicate metformin as a therapeutic agent in patients with leukemia, lymphomas, and multiple myeloma. In this article, we review current findings on the anticancer activities of metformin and the underlying mechanisms from preclinical and ongoing studies in hematologic malignancies.

Abstract
  Accumulating evidence implicates gut microbiota as promising targets for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). With a randomized clinical trial, we tested the hypothesis that alteration of gut microbiota may be involved in the alleviation of T2DM with hyperlipidemia by metformin and a specifically designed herbal formula (AMC). Four hundred fifty patients with T2DM and hyperlipidemia were randomly assigned to either the metformin- or AMC-treated group. After 12 weeks of treatment, 100 patients were randomly selected from each group and assessed for clinical improvement. The effects of the two drugs on the intestinal microbiota were evaluated by analyzing the V3 and V4 regions of the 16S rRNA gene by Illumina sequencing and multivariate statistical methods. Both metformin and AMC significantly alleviated hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia and shifted gut microbiota structure in diabetic patients. They significantly increased a coabundant group represented by Blautia spp., which significantly correlated with the improvements in glucose and lipid homeostasis. However, AMC showed better efficacies in improving homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and plasma triglyceride and also exerted a larger effect on gut microbiota. Furthermore, only AMC increased the coabundant group represented by Faecalibacterium spp., which was previously reported to be associated with the alleviation of T2DM in a randomized clinical trial. Metformin and the Chinese herbal formula may ameliorate type 2 diabetes with hyperlipidemia via enriching beneficial bacteria, such as Blautia and Faecalibacterium spp. IMPORTANCE Metabolic diseases such as T2DM and obesity have become a worldwide public health threat. Accumulating evidence indicates that gut microbiota can causatively arouse metabolic diseases, and thus the gut microbiota serves as a promising target for disease control. In this study, we evaluated the role of gut microbiota during improvements in hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia by two drugs: metformin and a specifically designed Chinese herbal formula (AMC) for diabetic patients with hyperlipidemia. Both drugs significantly ameliorated blood glucose and lipid levels and shifted the gut microbiota. Blautia spp. were identified as being associated with improvements in glucose and lipid homeostasis for both drugs. AMC exerted larger effects on the gut microbiota together with better efficacies in improving HOMA-IR and plasma triglyceride levels, which were associated with the enrichment of Faecalibacterium spp. In brief, these data suggest that gut microbiota might be involved in the alleviation of diabetes with hyperlipidemia by metformin and the AMC herbal formula.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: Type 2 diabetes and obesity are pro-inflammatory states associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Canagliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor, demonstrated superiority in lowering HbA1c versus glimepiride with less hypoglycemia and greater weight reduction via loss of fat mass in a 52-week trial of type 2 diabetes patients. This post hoc, exploratory analysis assessed the effects of canagliflozin versus glimepiride on select adipokines, inflammatory biomarkers, and chemokines.

   METHODS: Changes from baseline to Week 52 in serum leptin, adiponectin, IL-6, TNFalpha, CRP, PAI-1, VCAM-1, and MCP-1 were measured in a randomly selected subset of type 2 diabetes patients on metformin receiving canagliflozin 300mg (n=100) or glimepiride (n=100) in the overall study. Correlations between change in biomarkers and change in select metabolic and anthropometric variables were assessed.

   RESULTS: At Week 52, canagliflozin decreased median serum leptin by 25% (95% CI: -34%, -15%) and increased median serum adiponectin by 17% (95% CI: 11%, 23%) compared with glimepiride. There was a 22% reduction in median serum IL-6 (95% CI: -34%, -10%) and a 7% increase in median serum TNFalpha (95% CI: 1%, 12%) with canagliflozin versus glimepiride. No between-group differences were observed with the other biomarkers. The decrease in serum leptin with canagliflozin was correlated with change in weight (r>=0.3) only; the increase in adiponectin and decrease in IL-6 with canagliflozin occurred independently of changes in HbA1c, weight, or lipids.

   CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that canagliflozin may improve adipose tissue function and induce changes in serum leptin, adiponectin, and IL-6 that favorably impact insulin sensitivity and cardiovascular disease risk.

Abstract
  Prediabetes affects approximately 40% of American adults. Randomized trials report that a proportion of individuals with prediabetes develop diabetes despite caloric restriction, physical activity, and/or when treated with metformin, the first-line medication for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Currently, there are no valid predictors of the effectiveness of these measures in determining who will and who will not progress to the T2DM state. Few studies have examined the clinical and phenotypic predictors of better and worse glycemic response to lifestyle interventions and metformin in prediabetes and diabetes. Further studies incorporating 'omic' approaches to discover novel markers of phenotypes and treatment effectiveness may pave the way to personalizing the treatment of prediabetes and diabetes.

Abstract
  Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) are at a substantially increased risk of heart failure (HF) and HF mortality. Despite the lack of evidence that tight glycemic control reduces the incidence of cardiovascular (CV) events, a growing body of evidence suggests that the choice of glucose-lowering agents may influence outcomes including HF. Thiazolidinediones are associated with a significant risk of HF. For metformin, sulphonylureas and insulin, little data is available to indicate the impact on HF. The glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists, liraglutide and semaglutide, have been shown to reduce major CV events, but did not affect rates of hospitalization for HF. Clinical trials have demonstrated diverse effects of Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors on HF; saxagliptin showed an increased risk of HF admissions, alogliptin was associated with higher rates of new HF admissions, while sitagliptin had a neutral effect. The sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, empagliflozin and canagliflozin, have been recently shown to reduce the incidence of HF and cardiovascular mortality in patients with and without a history of HF. This review will summarize key findings of the impact of glucose-lowering agents on CV safety and HF-associated outcomes, present available data on the underlying mechanisms for the benefits of the SGLT2 inhibitors on HF, and discuss strategies to improve outcomes in patients with DM and high CV risk.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) results from progressive loss of beta-cell function. The BetaFat study compared gastric banding and metformin for their impact on beta-cell function in adults with moderate obesity and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or recently diagnosed, mild T2D.

   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Eighty-eight people aged 21-65 years, BMI 30-40 kg/m2, with IGT or diabetes known for <1 year, were randomized to gastric banding or metformin for 2 years. Hyperglycemic clamps (11.1 mmol/L) followed by arginine injection at maximally potentiating glycemia (>25 mmol/L) were performed at baseline, 12 months, and 24 months to measure steady-state C-peptide (SSCP) and acute C-peptide response to arginine at maximum glycemic potentiation (ACPRmax) and insulin sensitivity (M/I).

   RESULTS: At 24 months, the band group lost 10.7 kg; the metformin group lost 1.7 kg (P < 0.01). Insulin sensitivity increased 45% in the band group and 25% in the metformin group (P = 0.30 between groups). SSCP adjusted for insulin sensitivity fell slightly but not significantly in each group (P = 0.34 between groups). ACPRmax adjusted for insulin sensitivity fell significantly in the metformin group (P = 0.002) but not in the band group (P = 0.25 between groups). HbA1c fell at 12 and 24 months in the band group (P < 0.004) but only at 12 months (P < 0.01) in the metformin group (P > 0.14 between groups). Normoglycemia was present in 22% and 15% of band and metformin groups, respectively, at 24 months (P = 0.66 between groups).

   CONCLUSIONS: Gastric banding and metformin had similar effects to preserve beta-cell function and stabilize or improve glycemia over a 2-year period in moderately obese adults with IGT or recently diagnosed, mild T2D. Copyright © 2018 by the American Diabetes Association.

Abstract
  Overweight and obesity are major health concerns worldwide, and are major predisposing factors for type 2 diabetes. This single-centre, Phase I, randomised, open-label, single-dose, 4-arm crossover, device-drug interaction study on 24 healthy volunteers with a body mass index of 25-40 kg/m2 tested the effect of a novel, nonsystemic, orally administered hydrogel (GS100) on the pharmacokinetics of an oral antidiabetic drug, metformin. When administered in both the fed and fasted states, the effect of GS100 on metformin pharmacokinetic characteristics was found to be similar to that of food. The type, frequency, and intensity of adverse events observed when GS100 was co-administered with metformin were similar to those observed with metformin alone. This study demonstrates that GS100 can be taken by patients receiving metformin, without altering the administration of metformin.

Abstract
  PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Although intensive control of hyperglycemia has been proven to decrease the risk of microvascular complications in type 2 diabetes, it has had little apparent effect on reducing cardiovascular complications - the leading cause of mortality in this disease. We review the cardiovascular effects of various glucose-lowering medications, with a particular focus on the recent studies demonstrating clear benefits from members of several drug categories.

   RECENT FINDINGS: Recently, several randomized controlled studies have revealed significant improvements in cardiovascular outcomes from a thiazolidinedione, two sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors and two glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists.

   SUMMARY: These data suggest that certain glucose lowering agents after metformin should be favored in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients when there is underlying cardiovascular disease.

  BACKGROUND: Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are a new pharmacotherapeutic class for the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM).

   OBJECTIVE: To evaluate beneficial effects of the SGLT2 inhibitors on metabolic, cardiovascular, and renal outcomes.

   METHODS: A Pub-Med search (1966 to July 2017) was performed of published English articles using keywords sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors, canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and empagliflozin. A review of literature citations provided further references. The search identified 17 clinical trials and 2 meta-analyses with outcomes of weight loss and blood pressure reduction with dapagliflozin, canagliflozin, or empagliflozin. Three randomized trials focused on either empagliflozin or canagliflozin and reduction of cardiovascular disease and progression of renal disease.

   RESULTS: SGLT2 inhibitors have a beneficial profile in the treatment of T2DM. They have evidence of reducing weight between 2.9 kilograms when used as monotherapy to 4.7 kilograms when used in combination with metformin, and reducing systolic blood pressure between 3 to 5 mmHg and reducing diastolic blood pressure approximately 2 mmHg. To date, reduction of cardiovascular events was seen specifically with empagliflozin in patients with T2DM and a history of cardiovascular disease. In the same population, empagliflozin was associated with slowing the progression of kidney disease. Moreover, patients with increased risk of cardiovascular disease treated with canagliflozin have decreased risk of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal MI, or nonfatal stroke. Data regarding these outcomes with dapagliflozin are underway.

   CONCLUSION: SGLT2 inhibitors demonstrate some positive metabolic effects. In addition, empagliflozin specifically has demonstrated reduction in cardiovascular events and delay in the progression of kidney disease in patients with T2DM and a history of cardiovascular disease. Further data is needed to assess if this is a class effect. Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.

Abstract
  AIMS: To study the response of clinical variables (HbA1c , body weight, lipid profile and blood pressure) over 24 months of liraglutide treatment in a real-world clinical setting, and to describe the evolution of HbA1c and body weight reduction in response to liraglutide treatment by employing generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs).

   METHODS: We included people aged >= 18 years with Type 2 diabetes mellitus that initiated liraglutide treatment between November 2011 and May 2015. Demographic and clinical data were retrieved retrospectively over 24 months from electronic medical records with a median duration of observation of 7.0 (IQR 3.0-12.0) months.

   RESULTS: Individuals that initiated liraglutide therapy were obese (BMI 39.1 kg/m2 ), with inadequate HbA1c (68 mmol/mol [8.4%]), blood pressure and lipid levels. Upon liraglutide treatment, HbA1c , body weight, mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and lipid levels decreased gradually. GAMMs demonstrated that longer treatment with liraglutide was a predictor of improved HbA1c response, whereas higher baseline HbA1c , longer Type 2 diabetes duration and treatment with insulin were predictors of worse HbA1c response. Higher baseline weight, longer treatment with liraglutide and the interaction between metformin and time were predictors of improved weight response.

   CONCLUSIONS: In this real-world study, we showed the effectiveness of liraglutide in improving body weight, HbA1c , mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and lipid levels. GAMMs indicated that baseline HbA1c and weight, time of treatment with liraglutide, diabetes duration and the use of metformin or insulin are predictors of clinical response to liraglutide.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVES: More than 80% of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and diabetes mellitus (DM) burden now lies in low and middle-income countries. Hence, there is an urgent need to identify and implement the most cost-effective interventions, particularly in the resource-constraint South Asian settings. Thus, we aimed to systematically review the cost-effectiveness of individual-level, group-level and population-level interventions to control CVD and DM in South Asia.

   METHODS: We searched 14 electronic databases up to August 2016. The search strategy consisted of terms related to 'economic evaluation', 'CVD', 'DM' and 'South Asia'. Per protocol two reviewers assessed the eligibility and methodological quality of studies using standard checklists, and extracted incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of interventions.

   RESULTS: Of the 2949 identified studies, 42 met full inclusion criteria. Critical appraisal of studies revealed 15 excellent, 18 good and 9 poor quality studies. Most studies were from India (n=37), followed by Bangladesh (n=3), Pakistan (n=2) and Bhutan (n=1). The economic evaluations were based on observational studies (n=9), randomised trials (n=12) and decision models (n=21). Together, these studies evaluated 301 policy or clinical interventions or combination of both. We found a large number of interventions were cost-effective aimed at primordial prevention (tobacco taxation, salt reduction legislation, food labelling and food advertising regulation), and primary and secondary prevention (multidrug therapy for CVD in high-risk group, lifestyle modification and metformin treatment for diabetes prevention, and screening for diabetes complications every 2-5 years). Significant heterogeneity in analytical framework and outcome measures used in these studies restricted meta-analysis and direct ranking of the interventions by their degree of cost-effectiveness.

   CONCLUSIONS: The cost-effectiveness evidence for CVD and DM interventions in South Asia is growing, but most evidence is from India and limited to decision modelled outcomes. There is an urgent need for formal health technology assessment and policy evaluations in South Asia using local research data.

Abstract
  Prediabetes is the subclinical impairment in fasting plasma glucose, impaired glucose tolerance or both. The degree of impairment is between euglycemia and the hyperglycemia of type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Prediabetes is not considered benign, because it is a risk factor for T2DM but is also associated with micro and macrovascular complications. Lifestyle interventions including diet and exercise are first-line treatments. Medications can also play a role, as randomized controlled trials of biguanides (metformin) alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (Acarbose), inhibitors of pancreatic lipase (Orlistat), PPAR-gamma agonists (Rosiglitazone, Pioglitazone), meglitinides (Nateglinide) and GLP-1 receptor agonists (Liraglutide) have all shown benefits. Bariatric surgery is another efficacious means of preventing T2DM in patients with prediabetes and obesity. Prediabetes in its various guises is a risk factor for the future development T2DM and diabetic complications. Importantly the prediabetic state is amenable to interventions that prevent/delay transition to overt T2DM. Knowledge gaps exist regarding how best to make prognostication highly sensitive and specific as to which patient will develop T2DM. Moreover, understanding of phenotype specific pathophysiology may add value to funding appropriate interventions for patients with prediabetes. Management of patients with prediabetes should be individualized based on the algorithms that predict phenotype specific risk and allow for the use of phenotype tailored interventions.

Abstract
  AIMS: This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of dual therapy comprising sulfonylurea (SU) plus antidiabetic drugs for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

   METHODS: We searched the PubMed, Cochrane library, and Embase databases for randomized clinical trials (>=24 weeks) published up to December 28, 2017. Subsequently, we conducted pairwise and network meta-analyses to calculate the odds ratios (ORs) and mean differences (MDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the outcomes.

   RESULTS: The final analyses included 24 trials with a total of 10,032 patients. Compared with placebo, all treatment regimens were associated with a significantly higher risk of hypoglycemia, except the combinations of SU plus sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT-2i) [OR, 1.35 (95% CI: 0.81 to 2.25)] or alpha-glucosidase inhibitor (AGI) [OR, 1.16 (95% CI: 0.55 to 2.44)]. Notably, the combination of SU plus glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) was associated with the most significant increase in the risk of hypoglycemia. Furthermore, all SU-based combination regimens reduced the glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and fasting plasma glucose levels (FPG). However, only combinations containing SGLT-2i [MD, -1.00 kg (95% CI: -1.73 to -0.27)] and GLP-1RA [MD, -0.56 kg (95% CI: -1.10 to -0.02)] led to weight loss.

   CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the importance of considering the risk of hypoglycemia when selecting antidiabetic drugs to be administered concomitantly with SU. Although all classes of antidiabetic drugs improved glucose control when administered in combination with SU, SGLT-2i might be the best option with respect to factors such as hypoglycemia and body weight.

Abstract
  It is known that Cardiovascular (CV) disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Over the last years, one of the most discussed topics is the CV safety of anti-diabetic medications. Regarding CV safety of older antidiabetic agents the data are less clear and conclusions about their CV safety are mostly based on randomized controlled trials designed to assess their glucose lowering efficacy. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge about the CV safety of older and newer antidiabetic medications. According to the published literature metformin is the first line agent for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and seems to have cardio-protective effects. The choice of the second line agent when metformin monotherapy fails to achieve HbA1c targets is less clear. In the light of the findings of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial and the recently published LEADER and SUSTAIN 6 trials, empagliflozin, liraglutide and semaglutide seem reasonable options as second line agents for patients with CV disease. Sulfonylureas on the other hand, with the exception of gliclazide, should be avoided in those patients, although CV safety trials are still lacking. In individuals without CV disease any of the other classes of anti-diabetic medication can be selected on a patient-centered approach. Saxagliptin, alogliptin, sitagliptin and lixisenatide have been evaluated in CV safety trials and have neutral effects on CV outcomes, while pioglitazone may have some CV benefits. Saxagliptin and alogliptin, however, should be avoided in patients with heart failure, while pioglitazone is contraindicated in this population.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: We assessed whether changes in metabolic syndrome (MetS) severity during the treatment of prediabetes are associated with reduced risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD).

   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed data from the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) for 2,476 adults in 1996-1999 with prediabetes randomized to receive treatment with lifestyle modification, metformin, or placebo for 2-3 years and followed through 2014 for T2DM and CVD outcomes. We calculated effect sizes from baseline in a MetS severity z score (MetS-Z) and the individual MetS components, and assessed relationships between 1-year effect size and incident T2DM and CVD using hazard ratios (HRs) and mediation analysis.

   RESULTS: Baseline MetS-Z and its components were associated with risk of incident T2DM and CVD. During year 1 of intervention, MetS-Z and its components decreased most with lifestyle modification, followed by treatment with metformin and placebo. Risk of T2DM within 1-5 years was most strongly associated with 1-year changes in MetS-Z and waist circumference (both HRs for a 1 SD increase = 1.80), whereas the risk of CVD was associated with a 1-year change in MetS-Z, glucose, and systolic blood pressure. In mediation analyses, the effect of lifestyle modification on T2DM risk was mediated by 1-year changes in MetS-Z, waist circumference, glucose, and triglycerides, whereas the effect of metformin was mediated by MetS-Z and glucose.

   CONCLUSIONS: Changes in these risk indicators of MetS severity during intervention in the DPP reflect altered disease risk and may help in tracking earlier responses to treatment and in motivating patients. Copyright © 2018 by the American Diabetes Association.

Abstract
  The pharmacokinetics of metformin therapy in patients with chronic kidney disease stage 4 (CKD-4) were studied using data from the largest Phase I consecutive cohort trial yet performed in this population. Eighteen metformin-naive men and women with Type 2 Diabetes and creatinine clearance (CrCl) in the range 18-49 mL/min (eGFR 15-29 mL/min/1.73 m2) were allocated to daily immediate-release metformin of 250 mg, 500 mg, or 1000 mg. A first-dose profile and trough concentrations for 4 weeks were taken on all patients. Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters were estimated by fitting a first-order compartment model with absorption in a peripheral compartment to concentrations measured 24 hours post-first dose. Single-dose PK parameters time to maximum concentration (tmax) and maximum concentration (Cmax) were consistent with previous observations in patients with normal renal function (healthy and diabetic), as was the association between CrCl and apparent total oral clearance (Cl/F). However, patients with a CrCl below 32 mL/min had trough concentrations that were consistently above the steady-state minimum implied by the population PK model. This suggests the model may not apply to patients with CrCl below 32 mL/min. Metformin in doses of 500-1000 mg/day could be taken by CKD-4 patients. However, the single-compartment model breaks down as CrCl declines below 32 mL/min suggesting that metformin levels should be monitored regularly in progressive stage 4 CKD.

Abstract
  Objective: To compare the safety and efficacy of insulin degludec (IDeg) with those of insulin glargine (IGlar) in insulin-naive subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Methods: This was a 26-week, randomized, open-label, parallel-group, treat-to-target trial in 560 Chinese subjects with T2DM (men/women: 274/263, mean age 56 years, mean diabetes duration 7 years) inadequately controlled on oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs). Subjects were randomized 2:1 to once-daily IDeg (373 subjects) or IGlar(187 subjects), both in combination with metformin. The primary endpoint was changes from baseline in glycosylated hemoglobin(HbA1c) after 26 weeks. Results: Mean HbA1c decreased from 8.2% in both groups to 6.9% in IDeg and 7.0% in IGlar, respectively. Estimated treatment difference (ETD) of IDeg-IGlar in change from baseline was -0.10% points (95%CI-0.25-0.05). The proportion of subjects achieving HbA1c<7.0% was 56.3%and 49.7% with IDeg and IGlar, respectively [estimated odds ratio of IDeg/IGlar: 1.26(95%CI 0.88-1.82)]. Numerically lower rateof overall confirmed hypoglycaemia and statistically significantly lower nocturnal confirmed hypoglycemia were associated with IDeg compared with IGlar, respectively [estimated rateratio of IDeg/IGlar 0.69(95%CI 0.46-1.03), and 0.43(95%CI 0.19-0.97)]. No differences in other safety parameters were found between the two groups. Conclusions: IDeg was non-inferior to IGlar in terms of glycaemic control, and was associated with a statistically significantly lower rate of nocturnal confirmed hypoglycaemia.

Abstract
  Over the years, natural products have shown success as antidiabetics in in vitro, in vivo studies and clinical trials. Because natural product-derived drugs are more affordable and effective with fewer side-effects compared to conventional therapies, pharmaceutical research is increasingly leaning towards the discovery of new antidiabetic drugs from natural products targeting pathways or components associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) pathophysiology. However, the drug discovery process is very lengthy and costly with significant challenges. Therefore, various techniques are currently being developed for the preclinical research phase of drug discovery with the aim of drug development with less time and efforts from natural products. In this review, we have provided an update on natural products including fruits, vegetables, spices, nuts, beverages and mushrooms with potential antidiabetic activities from in vivo, in vitro and clinical studies. Synergistic interactions between natural products and antidiabetic drugs, and potential antidiabetic active compounds from natural products are also documented to pave the way for combination treatment and new drug discovery, respectively. Additionally, a brief idea of the drug discovery process along with the challenges that arise during drug development from natural products and the methods to conquer those challenges are discussed to create a more convenient future drug discovery process.

Abstract
  Thromboxane (TX)-dependent platelet activation and lipid peroxidation, as reflected in vivo by the urinary excretion of 11-dehydro-TXB2 and 8-iso-prostaglandin (PG)F2alpha, play a key role in atherothrombosis in obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) since the earlier stages. Thirty-five metformin-treated obese subjects with prediabetes or newly-diagnosed T2DM were randomized to the glucagon-like peptide receptor agonist (GLP-RA) liraglutide (1.8 mg/day) or lifestyle counseling until achieving a comparable weight loss (-7% of initial body weight), to assess whether changes in subcutaneous (SAT) and visceral (VAT) adipose tissue distribution (MRI), insulin sensitivity (Matsuda Index) and beta-cell performance (multiple sampling OGTT beta-index), with either intervention, might affect TX-dependent platelet activation, lipid peroxidation and inflammation. At baseline, Ln-8-iso-PGF2alpha (Beta = 0.31, p = 0.0088), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) (Beta = 2.64, p = 0.0011) Ln-TNF-alpha (Beta = 0.58, p = 0.0075) and SAT (Beta = 0.14, p = 0.044) were significant independent predictors of 11-dehydro-TXB2. After achievement of the weight loss target, a comparable reduction in U-11-dehydro-TXB2 (between-group p = 0.679) and 8-iso-PGF-2alpha (p = 0.985) was observed in both arms in parallel with a comparable improvement in glycemic control, insulin sensitivity, SAT, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP). In obese patients with initial impairment of glucose metabolism, the extent of platelet activation is related to systemic inflammation, isoprostane formation and degree of glycemic control and abdominal SAT. Successful weight loss, achieved with either lifestyle changes or an incretin-based therapy, is associated with a significant reduction in lipid peroxidation and platelet activation.

Abstract
  While commercialized since over 60 years, metformin is still the first-line drug recommended for the management of type 2 diabetes and is thus today the first glucose-lowering agent used worldwide. Despite this long experience, metformin retains its mysteries, especially regarding the underlying mechanisms responsible for its antidiabetic activity and other potential beneficial effects. During the last years, some contra-indications of metformin use have been at least partially withdrawn while new indications have been recognized. Furthermore, interesting prospects have been reported in important, although unexpected, medical areas such as cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. However, promising results in animal studies and observational human studies have now to be confirmed in well conducted randomized controlled trials.
Other Abstract
  Publisher Commercialisee depuis plus de 60 ans, la metformine est recommandee en premiere intention dans le traitement du diabete de type 2, ce qui en fait, aujourd'hui, le medicament anti-hyperglycemiant le plus prescrit a travers le monde. Malgre cette longue experience, la metformine garde ses mysteres, notamment quant aux mecanismes qui sous-tendent son action antidiabetique et d'autres effets potentiels. Au cours des dernieres annees, certaines contre-indications a l'utilisation de la metformine ont ete, au moins partiellement, levees tandis que de nouvelles indications apparaissent avec, par ailleurs, des perspectives interessantes dans des domaines aussi importants qu'inattendus, comme le cancer ou les maladies neurodegeneratives. Les resultats prometteurs des etudes animales et des etudes observationnelles humaines doivent cependant etre verifies dans des essais d'intervention controles bien conduits. Language: French

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: LY3298176 is a novel dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist that is being developed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. We aimed to examine the efficacy and safety of co-stimulation of the GLP-1 and GIP receptors with LY3298176 compared with placebo or selective stimulation of GLP-1 receptors with dulaglutide in patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes.

   METHODS: In this double-blind, randomised, phase 2 study, patients with type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1:1:1) to receive either once-weekly subcutaneous LY3298176 (1 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg), dulaglutide (1.5 mg), or placebo for 26 weeks. Assignment was stratified by baseline glycated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), metformin use, and body-mass index (BMI). Eligible participants (aged 18-75) had type 2 diabetes for at least 6 months (HbA1c 7.0-10.5%, inclusive), that was inadequately controlled with diet and exercise alone or with stable metformin therapy, and a BMI of 23-50 kg/m2. The primary efficacy outcome was change in HbA1c from baseline to 26 weeks in the modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population (all patients who received at least one dose of study drug and had at least one postbaseline measurement of any outcome). Secondary endpoints, measured in the mITT on treatment dataset, were change in HbA1c from baseline to 12 weeks; change in mean bodyweight, fasting plasma glucose, waist circumference, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides, and proportion of patients reaching the HbA1c target (<=6.5% and <7.0%) from baseline to weeks 12 and 26; and proportion of patients with at least 5% and 10% bodyweight loss from baseline to 26 weeks. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT03131687.

   FINDINGS: Between May 24, 2017, and March 28, 2018, 555 participants were assessed for eligibility, of whom 318 were randomly assigned to one of the six treatment groups. Because two participants did not receive treatment, the modified intention-to-treat and safety populations included 316 participants. 258 (81.7%) participants completed 26 weeks of treatment, and 283 (89.6%) completed the study. At baseline, mean age was 57 years (SD 9), BMI was 32.6 kg/m2 (5.9), duration from diagnosis of diabetes was 9 years (6), HbA1c was 8.1% (1.0), 53% of patients were men, and 47% were women. At 26 weeks, the effect of LY3298176 on change in HbA1c was dose-dependent and did not plateau. Mean changes from baseline in HbA1c with LY3298176 were -1.06% for 1 mg, -1.73% for 5 mg, -1.89% for 10 mg, and -1.94% for 15 mg, compared with -0.06% for placebo (posterior mean differences [80% credible set] vs placebo: -1.00% [-1.22 to -0.79] for 1 mg, -1.67% [-1.88 to -1.46] for 5 mg, -1.83% [-2.04 to -1.61] for 10 mg, and -1.89% [-2.11 to -1.67] for 15 mg). Compared with dulaglutide (-1.21%) the posterior mean differences (80% credible set) for change in HbA1c from baseline to 26 weeks with the LY3298176 doses were 0.15% (-0.08 to 0.38) for 1 mg, -0.52% (-0.72 to -0.31) for 5 mg, -0.67% (-0.89 to -0.46) for 10 mg, and -0.73% (-0.95 to -0.52) for 15 mg. At 26 weeks, 33-90% of patients treated with LY3298176 achieved the HbA1c target of less than 7.0% (vs 52% with dulaglutide, 12% with placebo) and 15-82% achieved the HbA1c target of at least 6.5% (vs 39% with dulaglutide, 2% with placebo). Changes in fasting plasma glucose ranged from -0.4 mmol/L to -3.4 mmol/L for LY3298176 (vs 0.9 mmol/L for placebo, -1.2 mmol/L for dulaglutide). Changes in mean bodyweight ranged from -0.9 kg to -11.3 kg for LY3298176 (vs -0.4 kg for placebo, -2.7 kg for dulaglutide). At 26 weeks, 14-71% of those treated with LY3298176 achieved the weight loss target of at least 5% (vs 22% with dulaglutide, 0% with placebo) and 6-39% achieved the weight loss target of at least 10% (vs 9% with dulaglutide, 0% with placebo). Changes in waist circumference ranged from -2.1 cm to -10.2 cm for LY3298176 (vs -1.3 cm for placebo, -2.5 cm for dulaglutide). Changes in total cholesterol ranged from 0.2 mmol/L to -0.3 mmol/L for LY3298176 (vs 0.3 mmol/L for placebo, -0.2 mmol/L for dulaglutide). Changes in HDL or LDL cholesterol did not differ between the LY3298176 and placebo groups. Changes in triglyceride concentration ranged from 0 mmol/L to -0.8 mmol/L for LY3298176 (vs 0.3 mmol/L for placebo, -0.3 mmol/L for dulaglutide). The 12-week outcomes were similar to those at 26 weeks for all secondary outcomes. 13 (4%) of 316 participants across the six treatment groups had 23 serious adverse events in total. Gastrointestinal events (nausea, diarrhoea, and vomiting) were the most common treatment-emergent adverse events. The incidence of gastrointestinal events was dose-related (23.1% for 1 mg LY3298176, 32.7% for 5 mg LY3298176, 51.0% for 10 mg LY3298176, and 66.0% for 15 mg LY3298176, 42.6% for dulaglutide, 9.8% for placebo); most events were mild to moderate in intensity and transient. Decreased appetite was the second most common adverse event (3.8% for 1 mg LY3298176, 20.0% for 5 mg LY3298176, 25.5% for 10 mg LY3298176, 18.9% for 15 mg LY3298176, 5.6% for dulaglutide, 2.0% for placebo). There were no reports of severe hypoglycaemia. One patient in the placebo group died from lung adenocarcinoma stage IV, which was unrelated to study treatment.

   INTERPRETATION: The dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist, LY3298176, showed significantly better efficacy with regard to glucose control and weight loss than did dulaglutide, with an acceptable safety and tolerability profile. Combined GIP and GLP-1 receptor stimulation might offer a new therapeutic option in the treatment of type 2 diabetes.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVES: The dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4 inhibitors) are effective modulators of fasting and postprandial hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In 2013 the Saxagliptin Assessment of Vascular Outcomes Recorded in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 53 (SAVOR-TIMI 53) clinical trial found an increased risk of heart failure exacerbation, as a secondary outcome, among patients treated with saxagliptin. This study examines the safety of DPP-4 inhibitors as a class in T2DM in relation to risk of heart failure exacerbations.

   METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of two groups of patients using data from the national Department of Veteran's Affairs (VA) Health Care System: patients initially prescribed DPP-4 inhibitors with or without second-generation sulfonylureas and/or metformin (exposed group) compared with patients initially prescribed only second-generation sulfonylureas and/or metformin (unexposed group) between August 1, 2013, and August 30, 2016. The primary aim of this study was to determine the difference in 1-year heart failure exacerbation rate in patients with T2DM between the exposed and unexposed groups. Data were analyzed using the chi2 Student t test and Kaplan-Meier analysis. Significance was set at p<0.05.

   RESULTS: The study evaluated 672,265 patients: 33,614 patients in the exposed group and 638,651 patients in the unexposed group. Overall, 130 (0.38%) heart failure exacerbations were documented in the exposed group, and 2222 (0.34%) heart failure exacerbations were documented in the unexposed group; the difference in exacerbation rate was nonsignificant between groups (p=0.24). In a subgroup analysis of patients with a baseline diagnosis of heart failure, the difference in rate of heart failure exacerbations remained nonsignificant (p=0.334).

   CONCLUSIONS: Patients in the veteran population with T2DM treated with DPP-4 inhibitors did not demonstrate a significant increase in risk for heart failure exacerbation, regardless of whether a patient had been previously diagnosed with heart failure. This finding potentially supports safe usage of DPP-4 inhibitors in this patient population regardless of heart failure diagnosis. Copyright Published 2018.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: We used a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to comparatively examine the effects of oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) on left ventricular mass (LVM) in patients with type 2 diabetes.

   METHODS: Document searches were implemented using Medline, Cochrane Controlled Trials Registry, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We decided to include RCTs that evaluated the impact of LVM using the administration of OADs to patients with type 2 diabetes. The outcome evaluations used standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We then performed a comparative examination of LVM related to the administration of OADs using random effects network meta-analysis.

   RESULTS: The document search found 11 RCTs (1410 people) that satisfied the eligibility criteria for this study, and these RCTs were incorporated into the network meta-analysis. The only medication that significantly reduced LVM compared to a placebo was gliclazide (SMD, -1.09; 95% CI, -1.62 to - 0.57). Further, when comparing the impact on LVM between OADs, only gliclazide significantly reduced LVM compared to other OADs (glyburide, voglibose, metformin, pioglitazone, rosiglitazone, and sitagliptin).

   CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, gliclazide was the only medication that significantly reduced LVM in patients with type 2 diabetes. When considered from the perspective of causing heart failure and preventing recurrence, it is possible that the use of gliclazide in patients with type 2 diabetes will provide multiple benefits.

Abstract
  Some antihyperglycemic medications have been found to affect bone metabolism. We assessed the long-term effects of metformin compared with placebo on bone mineral density (BMD) and trabecular bone score (TBS) in patients with type 2 diabetes. Metformin had no significant effect on BMD in the spine and hip or TBS compared with a placebo.

   INTRODUCTION: Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have an increased risk of fractures despite a high bone mass. Some antihyperglycemic medications have been found to affect bone metabolism. We assessed the long-term effects of metformin compared with placebo on bone mineral density (BMD) and trabecular bone score (TBS).

   METHODS: This was a sub-study of a multicenter, randomized, 18-month placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial with metformin vs. placebo in combination with different insulin regimens (the Copenhagen Insulin and Metformin Therapy trial) in patients with T2DM. BMD in the spine and hip and TBS in the spine were assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry at baseline and after 18 months follow-up.

   RESULTS: Four hundred seven patients were included in this sub-study. There were no between-group differences in BMD or TBS. From baseline to 18 months, TBS decreased significantly in both groups (metformin group, - 0.041 [- 0.055, - 0.027]; placebo group - 0.046 [- 0.058, - 0.034]; both p < 0.001). BMD in the spine and total hip did not change significantly from baseline to 18 months. After adjustments for gender, age, vitamin D, smoking, BMI, duration of T2DM, HbA1c, and insulin dose, the TBS between-group differences increased but remained non-significant. HbA1c was negatively associated with TBS (p = 0.009) as was longer duration of diabetes, with the femoral neck BMD (p = 0.003). Body mass index had a positive effect on the hip and femoral neck BMD (p < 0.001, p = 0.045, respectively).

   CONCLUSIONS: Eighteen months of treatment with metformin had no significant effect on BMD in the spine and hip or TBS in patients with T2DM compared with a placebo. TBS decreased significantly in both groups.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Recent studies reported that sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors reduced the cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) compared to placebo in contrast to no reduction with dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitors. However, there are no comparative studies on the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors and DPP4 inhibitors on HbA1c, body weight and hypoglycemia as risk factors of cardiovascular diseases. The aim of the present ongoing study is to compare the effects of dapagliflozin, a SGLT2 inhibitor, with those of sitagliptin, a DPP4 inhibitor, on cardiovascular risk factors in T2DM patients with inadequate glycemic control.

   METHODS: The study of dapagliflozin versus sitagliptin treatment efficacy on prevention of cardiovascular risk factors in T2DM patients (DIVERSITY-CVR study) is a prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded-endpoint, parallel-group, comparative study. A total of 340 T2DM patients treated with metformin alone or with no glucose-lowering agents (hemoglobin A1c >= 7.0 and < 10.0%) will be randomized into the dapagliflozin group (5-10 mg/day, n = 170) and the sitagliptin group (50-100 mg/day, n = 170), and treated for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint is the rate of achieving a composite endpoint of the following three items at 24th week; (1) HbA1c < 7.0%; (2) body weight loss of >= 3.0% from baseline; (3) avoidance of hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia will be monitored using the flash glucose monitoring system. The secondary outcomes include each component of the primary endpoint, plus indices of lipid metabolism, and evaluations related to safety.

   CONCLUSIONS: There is lack of solid information on differences in the therapeutic effects of SGLT2 inhibitors and DPP4 inhibitors on multiple risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. It is anticipated that the results of the DIVERSITY-CVR study provides useful clinical data on the management of patients with T2DM, including reducing the risk of CVD. The results of this study will become available in 2019. Trial registration University Hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trial Registry (UMIN000028014). Registered 30 June 2017.

Abstract
  AIM: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of ipragliflozin vs placebo as add-on therapy to metformin and sitagliptin in Korean patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

   METHODS: This double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centre, phase III study was conducted in Korea in 2015 to 2017. Patients were randomized to receive either ipragliflozin 50 mg/day or placebo once daily for 24 weeks in addition to metformin and sitagliptin. The primary endpoint was the change in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) from baseline to end of treatment (EOT).

   RESULTS: In total, 143 patients were randomized and 139 were included in efficacy analyses (ipragliflozin: 73, placebo: 66). Baseline mean (SD) HbA1c levels were 7.90 (0.69)% for ipragliflozin add-on and 7.92 (0.79)% for placebo. The corresponding mean (SD) changes from baseline to EOT were -0.79 (0.59)% and 0.03 (0.84)%, respectively, in favour of ipragliflozin (adjusted mean difference -0.83% [95% CI -1.07 to -0.59]; P < .0001). More ipragliflozin-treated patients than placebo-treated patients achieved HbA1c target levels of <7.0% (44.4% vs 12.1%) and < 6.5% (12.5% vs 1.5%) at EOT (P < .05 for both). Fasting plasma glucose, fasting serum insulin, body weight and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance decreased significantly at EOT, in favour of ipragliflozin (adjusted mean difference -1.64 mmol/L, -1.50 muU/mL, -1.72 kg, and -0.99, respectively; P < .05 for all). Adverse event rates were similar between groups (ipragliflozin: 51.4%; placebo: 50.0%). No previously unreported safety concerns were noted.

   CONCLUSIONS: Ipragliflozin as add-on to metformin and sitagliptin significantly improved glycaemic variables and demonstrated a good safety profile in Korean patients with inadequately controlled T2DM.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Early glucose lowering intervention in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus was demonstrated to be beneficial in terms of micro- and macrovascular risk reduction. However, most of currently ongoing cardiovascular outcome trials are performed in subjects with manifest atherosclerosis and long-standing diabetes. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the effects of the dipeptidylpeptidase-4 inhibitor linagliptin in subjects with coronary artery disease (CAD) but early type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) on a set of cardiovascular surrogate measurements.

   METHODS: In this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, single-center study, we included subjects with early diabetes (postchallenge diabetes (2 h glucose > 200 mg/dl) or T2DM treated with diet only or on a stable dose of metformin monotherapy and an HbA1c < 75 mmol/mol) and established CAD. Participants were randomized to receive either linagliptin (5 mg) once daily orally or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was the change in flow mediated dilatation (FMD). The secondary objective was to investigate the effect of linagliptin treatment on arginine bioavailability ratios [Global arginine bioavailability ratio (GABR) and arginine to ornithine ratio (AOR)]. Arginine, ornithine and citrulline were measured in serum samples with a conventional usual amino acid analysis technique, involving separation of amino acids by ion exchange chromatography followed by postcolumn continuous reaction with ninhydrin. GABR was calculated by L-arginine divided by the sum of (L-ornithine plus L-citrulline). The AOR was calculated by dividing L-arginine by L-ornithine levels. Group comparisons were calculated by using a two-sample t-test with Satterthwaite adjustment for unequal variances.

   RESULTS: We investigated 43 patients (21% female) with a mean age of 63.3 +/- 8.2 years. FMD at baseline was 3.5 +/- 3.1% in the linagliptin group vs. 4.0 +/- 2.9% in the placebo group. The change in mean FMD in the linagliptin group was not significantly different compared to the change in the placebo group (0.43 +/- 4.84% vs. - 0.45 +/- 3.01%; p = 0.486). No significant improvements were seen in the arginine bioavailability ratios (GABR; p = 0.608 and AOR; p = 0.549).

   CONCLUSION: Linagliptin treatment in subjects with CAD and early T2DM did not improve endothelial function or the arginine bioavailability ratios. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02350478 ( https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02350478 ).

Abstract
  AIMS: Type 2 diabetes is associated with endothelial dysfunction leading to cardiovascular disease. CD34+ endothelial Progenitor Cells (EPCs) are responsible for endothelial repair and neo-angiogenesis and can be used as a cardiovascular disease risk biomarker. This study investigated whether the addition of saxagliptin, a DPP-IV inhibitor, to metformin, may reduce cardiovascular disease risk in addition to improving glycemic control in Type 2 diabetes patients.

   METHODS: In 12 week, double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial, 42 subjects already taking metformin 1-2 grams/day were randomized to placebo or saxagliptin 5 mg. Subjects aged 40-70 years with diabetes for < 10 years, with no known cardiovascular disease, BMI 25-39.9, HbA1C 6-9% were included. We evaluated EPCs number, function, surface markers and gene expression, in addition to arterial stiffness, blood biochemistries, resting energy expenditure, and body composition parameters. A mixed model regression to examine saxagliptin vs placebo, accounting for within-subject autocorrelation, was done with SAS (p < 0.05).

   RESULTS: Although there was no significant increase in CD34+ cell number, CD31+ cells percentage increased. Saxagliptin increased migration (in response to SDF1alpha) with a trend of higher colony formation count. MNCs cytometry showed higher percentage of CXCR4 double positivity for both CD34 and CD31 positive cells, indicating a functional improvement. Gene expression analysis showed an upregulation in CD34+ cells for antioxidant SOD1 (p < 0.05) and a downregulation in CD34- cells for IL-6 (p < 0.01). For arterial stiffness, both augmentation index and systolic blood pressure measures went down in saxagliptin subjects (p < 0.05).

   CONCLUSION: Saxagliptin, in combination with metformin, can help improve endothelial dysfunction in early diabetes before macrovascular complications appear. Trial registration Trial is registered under clinicaltrials.gov, NCT02024477.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that liraglutide could have an impact on glucose and lipid metabolism disorder and adhesion molecule activation, which may play important roles in the vascular damage of diabetes. In this study, we examined the effects of liraglutide versus metformin on non-esterified free fatty acids, beta-cell insulin secretion, and adhesion molecule levels in patients with recent-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus.

   METHODS: In this study, 60 patients newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus (mean age 33.97 +/- 5.67 years) were randomly assigned to receive once-daily subcutaneous liraglutide or oral metformin. Before the study and after the 8-week treatment period, a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test was performed. Plasma glucose, lipids and lipoprotein, plasma insulin, glycaemic and insulin responses, non-esterified free fatty acids (NEFA), and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1) levels were evaluated.

   RESULTS: After 8 weeks, 120 min of NEFA (155 +/- 125 vs 99 +/- 73 micromol/L, P = 0.026) and the levels of sVCAM-1 (465 +/- 136 vs 382 +/- 131 ng/ml, P = 0.013) significantly decreased, while the early phase insulin secretion index (24.94 [7.78, 38.89] vs. 31.13 [17.67, 59.09], P = 0.031), fasting plasma insulin (104 [51, 123] vs 113 [54, 171] mIU/L, P = 0.015), 60 min plasma insulin (326 [165, 441] vs 471 [334, 717] mIU/L, P = 0.005), 120 min plasma insulin (401 [193, 560] vs 500 [367, 960] mIU/L, P = 0.047), and insulin area under the curve (AUCins) (648 [321, 742] vs 738 [451, 1118] mIU/L, P = 0.005) remarkably increased for patients in the liraglutide treatment group. The levels of sVCAM-1 dramatically decreased after 8 weeks of liraglutide treatment (503 +/- 182 vs 382 +/- 131 ng/ml, P = 0.046) compared to that of the metformin treatment group. At the same time, the differences before and after liraglutide treatment in 120 min of NEFA (- 32 [- 96, - 5] vs 5 [- 35, 38] micromol/L, P = 0.033) and AUCins (738 [451, 1118] vs 594 [357, 1216] mIU/L, P = 0.014) were remarkably enhanced compared to that of the metformin therapy. Nevertheless, there were no significant differences in fasting NEFA after liraglutide or metformin treatment. The reduction of 120 min NEFA (DELTANEFA) was positively correlated with the decrease of sVCAM-1 (DELTAsVCAM-1) after 8 weeks of liraglutide treatment (r = 0.523, P = 0.003).

   CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that liraglutide administration is more effective than metformin in reducing 120 min NEFA and suppressing sVCAM-1 levels for recent-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus. We suggest that this outcome may be because liraglutide is associated with potentiating insulin secretion capacity, inhibiting vascular inflammatory cytokines, and antagonizing atherosclerosis.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Incretin-based therapies are used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity. We investigated the changes in arterial stiffness and left ventricular (LV) myocardial deformation after 6-month treatment with the GLP-1 analogue liraglutide in subjects with newly diagnosed T2DM.

   METHODS: We randomized 60 patients with newly diagnosed and treatment-naive T2DM to receive either liraglutide (n = 30) or metformin (n = 30) for 6 months. We measured at baseline and after 6-month treatment: (a) carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) (b) LV longitudinal strain (GLS), and strain rate (GLSR), peak twisting (pTw), peak twisting velocity (pTwVel) and peak untwisting velocity (pUtwVel) using speckle tracking echocardiography. LV untwisting was calculated as the percentage difference between peak twisting and untwisting at MVO (%dpTw-UtwMVO), at peak (%dpTw-UtwPEF) and end of early LV diastolic filling (%dpTw-UtwEDF) (c) Flow mediated dilatation (FMD) of the brachial artery and percentage difference of FMD (FMD%) (d) malondialdehyde (MDA), protein carbonyls (PCs) and NT-proBNP.

   RESULTS: After 6-months treatment, subjects that received liraglutide presented with a reduced PWV (11.8 +/- 2.5 vs. 10.3 +/- 3.3 m/s), MDA (0.92 [0.45-2.45] vs. 0.68 [0.43-2.08] nM/L) and NT-proBNP (p < 0.05) in parallel with an increase in GLS (- 15.4 +/- 3 vs. - 16.6 +/- 2.7), GLSR (0.77 +/- 0.2 vs. 0.89 +/- 0.2), pUtwVel (- 97 +/- 49 vs. - 112 +/- 52degree, p < 0.05), %dpTw-UtwMVO (31 +/- 10 vs. 40 +/- 14), %dpTw-UtwPEF (43 +/- 19 vs. 53 +/- 22) and FMD% (8.9 +/- 3 vs. 13.2 +/- 6, p < 0.01). There were no statistically significant differences of the measured markers in subjects that received metformin except for an improvement in FMD. In all subjects, PCs levels at baseline were negatively related to the difference of GLS (r = - 0.53) post-treatment and the difference of MDA was associated with the difference of PWV (r = 0.52) (p < 0.05 for all associations) after 6-month treatment.

   CONCLUSIONS: Six-month treatment with liraglutide improves arterial stiffness, LV myocardial strain, LV twisting and untwisting and NT-proBNP by reducing oxidative stress in subjects with newly diagnosed T2DM. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT03010683.

Abstract
  AIM: Metformin is the first-line treatment for Type 2 diabetes. However, not all people benefit from this drug. Our aim was to investigate the effects of metformin on the plasma metabolome and whether the pretreatment metabolite profile can predict HbA1c outcome.

   METHODS: Post hoc analysis of the Copenhagen Insulin and Metformin Therapy (CIMT) trial, a multicentre study from May 2008 to December 2012, was carried out. We used a non-target method to analyse 87 plasma metabolites in participants with Type 2 diabetes (n = 370) who were randomized in a 1 : 1 ratio to 18 months of metformin or placebo treatment. Metabolites were measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry at baseline and at 18-month follow-up and the data were analysed using a linear mixed-effect model.

   RESULTS: At baseline, participants who were on metformin before the trial (n = 312) had higher levels of leucine/isoleucine and five lysophosphatidylethanolamines (LPEs), and lower levels of carnitine and valine compared with metformin-naive participants (n = 58). At follow-up, participants randomized to metformin (n = 188) had elevated levels of leucine/isoleucine and reduced carnitine, tyrosine and valine compared with placebo (n = 182). At baseline, participants on metformin treatment with the highest levels of carnitine C10:1 and leucine/isoleucine had the lowest HbA1c (P-interaction = 0.02 and 0.03, respectively). This association was not significant with HbA1c at follow-up.

   CONCLUSIONS: Metformin treatment is associated with decreased levels of valine, tyrosine and carnitine, and increased levels of leucine/isoleucine. None of the identified metabolites can predict the HbA1c -lowering effect of metformin. Further studies of the association between metformin, carnitine and leucine/isoleucine are warranted.

Abstract
  AIMS: Previous studies have shown that dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-4 inhibition lowers glucagon levels whereas sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibition increases them. This study evaluated the extent of these opposite effects in a direct comparative head-to-head study.

   METHODS: In a single-centre, randomized study with a cross-over design, 28 metformin-treated patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) (mean age, 63 years; baseline HbA1c, 6.8%) were treated with vildagliptin (50 mg twice daily) or dapagliflozin (10 mg once daily) for 2 weeks, with a 4-week wash-out period between the two separate treatments. After each treatment period, a meal test was undertaken, with measurements of islet and incretin hormones and 4-hour area under the curve (AUC) levels were estimated.

   RESULTS: Fasting glucagon (35.6 +/- 2.5 vs 39.4 +/- 3.4 pmoL/L; P = .032) and postprandial glucagon (4-hour AUCglucagon , 32.1 +/- 2.3 vs 37.5 +/- 2.7 nmoL/L min; P = .001) were ~15% lower after vildagliptin compared to dapagliflozin treatment. This was associated with stronger early (15 minute) C-peptide response and higher 4-hour AUCC-peptide (P < .010), higher 4-hour AUC of the intact form of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) (P < .001) and lower 4-hour AUC of total GIP and GLP-1 (P < .001).

   CONCLUSION: Treatment with DPP-4 inhibition with vildagliptin results in 15% lower fasting and postprandial glucagon levels compared to SGLT-2 inhibition with dapagliflozin. DPP-4 inhibition also induces more rapid insulin secretion and higher levels of intact incretin hormones, resulting in stronger feedback inhibition of incretin hormone secretion than SGLT-2 inhibition.

Abstract
  AIMS: To establish whether the risk of hypoglycaemia is greater with 2 consecutive days of very-low-calorie diet compared with 2 non-consecutive days of very-low-calorie diet in people with Type 2 diabetes.

   METHODS: This was a non-blinded randomized parallel group interventional trial of intermittent fasting in adults. The participants had a BMI of 30-45 kg/m2 , Type 2 diabetes treated with metformin and/or hypoglycaemic medications and an HbA1c concentration of 50-86 mmol/mol (6.7-10%). The participants followed a 2092-2510-kJ diet on 2 days per week for 12 weeks. A total of 41 participants were randomized 1:1 to consecutive (n=19) or non-consecutive (n=22) day fasts, of whom 37 (n=18 and n=19, respectively) were included in the final analysis. The primary outcome was difference in the rate of hypoglycaemia between the two study arms. Secondary outcomes included change in diet, quality of life, weight, lipid, glucose and HbA1c levels, and liver function.

   RESULTS: The mean hypoglycaemia rate was 1.4 events over 12 weeks. Fasting increased the rate of hypoglycaemia despite medication reduction (RR 2.05, 95% CI 1.17 to 3.52). There was no difference between fasting on consecutive days and fasting on non-consecutive days (RR 1.54, 95% CI 0.35 to 6.11). Improvements in weight, HbA1c , fasting glucose and quality of life were experienced by participants in both arms.

   CONCLUSIONS: In individuals with Type 2 diabetes on hypoglycaemic medications, fasting of any type increased the rate of hypoglycaemia. With education and medication reduction, fewer than expected hypoglycaemic events occurred. Although it was not possible to determine whether fasting on consecutive days increased the risk of hypoglycaemia, an acceptable rate was observed in both arms. Copyright © 2018 Diabetes UK.

Abstract
  AIM: To assess the efficacy and safety of ipragliflozin as add-on therapy to metformin in Russian patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

   METHODS: In this double-blind study conducted in 14 centers in Russia, 165 patients were randomized 2:1 to ipragliflozin (50mg/day) or placebo for 24weeks while continuing metformin. Patients who had HbA1c>=7.0% (53mmol/mol) at Week 12 received open-label ipragliflozin (50mg/day) in addition to the blinded drug from Week 12-24.

   RESULTS: Significant reductions in HbA1c and body weight from baseline to Week 12 in favor of ipragliflozin were observed (adjusted mean difference to placebo: -0.3% (-3 mmol/mol), P=0.048 and -1.34kg, P<0.001, respectively). The incidence of AEs was similar in both groups. Uptitration to 100mg/day ipragliflozin led to a further reduction in body weight (mean change from Week 12: -0.65kg, P=0.004) and an additional 13% (9/69) of patients achieving HbA1c<7.0% (53mmol/mol) at Week 24. Incidence of AEs was similar among patients receiving ipragliflozin 50mg/day (23.7%) and 100mg/day (24.6%).

   CONCLUSION: Ipragliflozin 50mg/day added to metformin significantly reduced HbA1c and body weight after 12weeks and showed a safety profile comparable to placebo. Uptitration to 100mg/day improved clinical outcomes with no additional safety concerns. Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  AIMS: To study the effects of metformin, as compared to placebo, on serum levels of vitamin D (25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]) in patients with advanced type 2 diabetes.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the HOME trial, a randomized placebo-controlled trial, 390 insulin-treated patients with type 2 diabetes were treated with 850 mg metformin or placebo thrice daily for 52 months. In a post-hoc analysis, we examined changes in the combined levels of 25(OH)D2 and 25(OH)D3 at 4 and 16 months during the study.

   RESULTS: Mean combined 25(OH)D at baseline was 68.2 nmoL/L (95% confidence interval [CI]: 65.5-71.1). In mixed model analysis, metformin, as compared to placebo, had no effect on 25(OH)D levels during 16 months (coefficient: 1.002 per month, multiplicative model; 95% CI: 0.998-1.006, P = .30). Metformin was associated with a small increase of 25(OH)D2 (coefficient: 1.012 per month; 95% CI: 1.003-1.021, P = .008). However, 25(OH)D2 is only a very small fraction (3%) of 25(OH)D. Seasonal variation had the biggest impact on 25(OH)D levels. Vitamin B12 levels were not associated with the levels of 25(OH)D.

   CONCLUSION: Metformin had no effect on serum 25(OH)D during 16 months in the setting of a clinical randomized controlled trial in patients with type 2 diabetes. Our results show that metformin doesn't lead to vitamin D deficiency. Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Abstract
  AIMS: Maintainance of glucagon response to hypoglycaemia is important as a safeguard against hypoglycaemia during glucose-lowering therapy in type 2 diabetes. During recent years, DPP-4 (dipeptidyl peptidase-4) inhibition has become more commonly used in elderly patients. However, whether DPP-4 inhibition affects the glucagon response to hypoglycaemia in the elderly is not known and was the aim of this study.

   METHODS: In a single-centre, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study, 28 subjects with metformin-treated type 2 diabetes (17 male, 11 female; mean age, 74 years [range 65-86]; mean HbA1c, 51.5 mmol/mol [6.9%]) received sitagliptin (100 mg once daily) as add-on therapy or placebo for 4 weeks with a 4-week washout period in between. After each treatment period, the subjects underwent a standard breakfast test, followed by a 2-step hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemic clamp (target 3.5 and 3.0 mmol/L), followed by lunch.

   RESULTS: Glucagon levels after breakfast and lunch, and the glucagon response at 3.5 mmol/L, were lower after sitagliptin than after placebo. However, the glucagon response to hypoglycaemia at 3.1 mmol/L did not differ significantly between the two. Similarly, the noradrenaline, adrenaline and cortisol responses were lower with sitagliptin than with placebo at 3.5 mmol/L, but not at 3.1 mmol/L glucose. Responses in pancreatic polypeptide did not differ between the two.

   CONCLUSIONS: Elderly subjects with metformin-treated type 2 diabetes have lower glucagon levels at 3.5 mmol/L glucose, but maintain the glucagon response to hypoglycaemia at 3.1 mmol/L during DPP-4 inhibition, which safeguards against hypoglycaemia and may contribute to decreasing the risk of hypoglycaemia by DPP-4 inhibition in this age group.

Abstract
  Statins are widely prescribed, yet statin muscle pain limits their use, leading to increased cardiovascular risk. No validated therapy for statin muscle pain exists. The goal of the study was to assess whether metformin was associated with reduced muscle pain. A secondary analysis of data from the ACCORD trial was performed. An ACCORD sub-study assessed patients for muscle cramps and leg/calve pain while walking, typical non-severe statin muscle pain symptoms. We compared muscle pain between patients using a statin (n = 445) or both a statin and metformin (n = 869) at baseline. Overall patient characteristics were balanced between groups. Unadjusted analysis showed fewer reports of muscle cramps (35%) and leg/calve pain while walking (40%) with statins and metformin compared to statin only (muscle cramps, 42%; leg/calve pain while walking, 47%). Multivariable regression demonstrated a 22% odds reduction for muscle cramps (P = 0.049) and a 29% odds reduction for leg/calve pain while walking (P = 0.01). Metformin appears to reduce the risk of non-severe statin muscle pain and additional research is needed to confirm the findings and assess metformin's impact on statin adherence and related cardiovascular outcomes.

Abstract
  AIM: To describe the baseline characteristics of participants randomized in the Dapagliflozin Effect on CardiovascuLAR Events (DECLARE-TIMI 58) trial, the pivotal study conducted to assess cardiovascular (CV) outcomes with dapagliflozin.

   METHODS: The DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial will analyse 17 160 patients with type 2 diabetes randomized to treatment with dapagliflozin (10 mg/d) or matching placebo. We analysed their baseline characteristics.

   RESULTS: The participants' mean +/- SD age was 63.8 +/- 6.8 years, 62.6% were male, and their mean +/- SD diabetes duration was 11.8 +/- 7.8 years, glycated haemoglobin 8.3% +/- 1.2% (67 mmol/mol +/- 9.7 mmol/mol) and body mass index 32.1 +/- 6.0 kg/m2 . Randomization included 6971 (40.6%) patients with atherosclerotic CV disease (CVD), and 10 189 (59.4%) patients with multiple risk factors (MRF) for CVD (defined as men age >= 55 years or women >=60 years, with at least one of dyslipidaemia, hypertension or smoking). Patients with CVD compared with patients with MRF were younger (62.5 +/- 8.1 vs 64.7 +/- 5.6 years), more frequently male (72.1% vs 56.1%), less often used metformin (74.6% vs 81.2%), more often used insulin (44.2% vs 36.4%), and more frequently used statins, aspirin, clopidogrel and beta-blockers (82.2%, 71.1%, 24.7% and 66.6% vs 63.7%, 39.1%, 1.5% and 32.3%, respectively).

   CONCLUSION: The DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial is expected to provide conclusive data on the effect of treatment with dapagliflozin in addition to standard of care, on CV outcomes in a broad patient population with type 2 diabetes and CVD or MRF for CVD. Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Abstract
  AIM: To determine the effects of early intensive glycaemic control with intensive insulin treatment (IIT) or initial combined oral antidiabetic drug (COAD) therapy on long-term glycaemic control and the preservation of beta-cell function in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

   METHODS: Newly diagnosed drug-naive patients with T2DM from 8 outpatient diabetes centres were randomized to receive either IIT (n = 50; glargine/glulisine) or COAD (n = 47; glimepiride/metformin) as intensive treatment until the termination criteria to ensure euglycaemia were met. After intensive treatment, the patients completed a follow-up period with either lifestyle modification (LSM) alone or rescue therapy to maintain target glycated haemoglobin levels of <7% (53 mmol/mol) up to week 104. The primary outcomes were analysed after excluding participants who were anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase autoantibody-positive.

   RESULTS: Both intensive treatment methods were effective for short-term glycaemic control, but improvements in the disposition index (DI) were significantly greater in the IIT group than in the COAD group (P = .021). During the follow-up period after intensive treatment, the two groups significantly differed in rescue method regarding the maintenance of comparable levels of glycaemic control (P = .010) and more participants who received IIT exhibited well-controlled glycaemia with LSM alone. Additionally, the IIT group maintained a higher DI than the COAD group during the follow-up period. Cox regression analysis showed that the IIT method was associated with a 52.5% lower risk of failing to maintain drug-free glycaemic remission compared with the COAD method (P = .015).

   CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate that outpatient clinic-based IIT to ensure euglycaemia in newly diagnosed patients with T2DM might be an effective initial therapeutic option for improvements in beta-cell function and glycaemic control over the long term, without serious adverse events.

Abstract
  AIM: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of ertugliflozin and sitagliptin co-administration vs the individual agents in patients with type 2 diabetes who are inadequately controlled with metformin.

   METHODS: In this study (Clinicaltrials.gov NCT02099110), patients with glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) >=7.5% and <=11.0% (>=58 and <=97 mmol/mol) with metformin >=1500 mg/d (n = 1233) were randomized to ertugliflozin 5 (E5) or 15 (E15) mg/d, sitagliptin 100 mg/d (S100) or to co-administration of E5/S100 or E15/S100. The primary endpoint was change from baseline in HbA1c at Week 26.

   RESULTS: At Week 26, least squares mean HbA1c reductions from baseline were greater with E5/S100 (-1.5%) and E15/S100 (-1.5%) than with individual agents (-1.0%, -1.1% and -1.1% for E5, E15 and S100, respectively; P < .001 for all comparisons). HbA1c <7.0% (<53 mmol/mol) was achieved by 26.4%, 31.9%, 32.8%, 52.3% and 49.2% of patients in the E5, E15, S100, E5/S100 and E15/S100 groups, respectively. Fasting plasma glucose reductions were significantly greater with E5/S100 and E15/S100 compared with individual agents. Body weight and systolic blood pressure (SBP) significantly decreased with E5/S100 and E15/S100 vs S100 alone. Glycaemic control, body weight and SBP effects of ertugliflozin were maintained to Week 52. Genital mycotic infections were more common among ertugliflozin-treated patients compared with those treated with S100. Incidences of symptomatic hypoglycaemia and adverse events related to hypovolaemia or urinary tract infection were similar among groups.

   CONCLUSIONS: In patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes while using metformin, co-administration of ertugliflozin and sitagliptin provided more effective glycaemic control through 52 weeks compared with the individual agents.

Abstract
  AIMS: Several trials have reported that dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, used to treat type 2 diabetes (T2DM), improve endothelial function. The current study investigated the effects of vildagliptin, a DPP-4 inhibitor, compared to glibenclamide on endothelial function, arterial stiffness, and blood pressure in patients with T2DM and hypertension.

   METHODS: Patients aged over 35 years with T2DM and hypertension, but without cardiovascular disease, were randomly allocated to treatment with vildagliptin (n = 25) or glibenclamide (n = 25). Both groups took metformin. Endothelial function was evaluated by peripheral artery tonometry (Endo-PAT 2000) to calculate the reactive hyperemia index (RHI) and arterial stiffness. Primary outcome was change in the RHI after 12 weeks of treatment. Twenty-four-hour non-invasive ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was performed using a Mobil-O-Graph R 24-h PWA monitor. Arterial stiffness was assessed using the augmentation index corrected for 75 bpm (AIx75), pulse wave velocity (PWV) and central systolic blood pressure (cSBP).

   RESULTS: There were no changes in the RHI in the vildagliptin group (before 2.35 +/- 0.59; after 2.24 +/- 0.60; p value = NS) or in the glibenclamide group (before 2.36 +/- 0.52; after 2.34 +/- 0.50; p value = NS), with no differences between groups (p value = NS). There was also no difference between vildagliptin and glibenclamide treatment in respect to AIx75 (p value = NS), cSBP (p value = NS) or PWV (p value = NS).

   CONCLUSIONS: Vildagliptin and glibenclamide similarly do not change the endothelial function and arterial stiffness after 12 weeks of treatment in diabetic and hypertensive patients without cardiovascular disease. Thus, vildagliptin has a neutral effect on vascular function.

Abstract
  AIMS: Metformin treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) can be limited by gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events (AEs), resulting in treatment discontinuation. We investigated whether once-daily metformin extended release (XR) is superior in terms of GI tolerability, with non-inferior efficacy, compared with thrice-daily metformin immediate release (IR) in treatment-naive Chinese patients with T2DM.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective, open-label, randomized, multicentre, phase IV interventional study enrolled Chinese T2DM patients to receive either metformin XR or metformin IR with a 2-week screening period, a 16-week treatment period and a 2-week follow-up period without treatment. Co-primary endpoints were a non-inferiority assessment of metformin XR vs metformin IR in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) least squares mean (LSM) change from baseline to week 16 and the superiority of GI tolerability for metformin XR vs metformin IR.

   RESULTS: Overall, 532 patients were randomized to metformin IR (n = 267) or metformin XR (n = 265). The HbA1c LSM change was -1.61% and -1.58% in each group, respectively (LSM difference, 0.03; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.10, 0.17). Incidences of drug-related AEs were 26.5% (n = 66) in the metformin IR-only group and 32.2% (n = 85) in the metformin XR-only group, and GI AEs were 23.8% and 22.3% in each group, respectively (difference, -1.52; 95% CI, -8.60, 5.56). The treatment difference met the predefined non-inferiority upper CI margin of 0.4% in HbA1c.

   CONCLUSIONS: Metformin XR was non-inferior to metformin IR for the LSM change in HbA1c from baseline to week 16 and not superior to metformin IR for overall GI AE incidence during treatment of Chinese T2DM patients. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Abstract
  AIMS: To assess the evidence supporting the choice of third-line agents in adults with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published between January 2000 and July 2017 that reported data on cardiometabolic outcomes and hypoglycaemia for glucose-lowering agents added to metformin-based dual treatments. Data were stratified by background therapy and RCT duration, and synthesized, when possible, with network meta-analyses.

   RESULTS: A total of 43 RCTs (16 590 participants) were included, with metformin combined with: sulphonylureas (SUs) in 20 RCTs; thiazolidinediones (TZDs) in 10; basal or rapid-acting insulin in 6; dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors in 3; glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) in 2; and sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors in 2. When added to metformin and SUs, after 24 to 36 weeks, rapid-acting insulin resulted in the largest reduction in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c; 1.6% vs placebo), followed by GLP-1RAs (1.0%), basal insulin (0.8%) and SGLT-2 inhibitors (0.7%), with no difference between GLP-1RAs and SGLT-2 inhibitors; body weight increased with insulin treatment (~3 kg vs placebo), while the greatest reduction was observed for SGLT-2 inhibitors compared with all other therapies. Limited data for hypoglycaemia indicated a similar risk for SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1RAs. Results for third-line agents added to metformin and TZDs were comparable, showing similar HbA1c reduction and risk of hypoglycaemia between SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1RAs, and a slightly greater reduction in body weight with SGLT-2 inhibitors vs GLP-1RAs. Data for 52 to 54 weeks were more limited: added to metformin and a SU, TZDs, GLP-1RAs or SGLT-2 inhibitors reduced HbA1c to a similar extent but had different effects on body weight (7 kg and 5 kg more with TZDs vs SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1RAs, respectively; 2 kg less when comparing SGLT-2 inhibitors with GLP-1RAs). Formal analyses could not be performed for any other dual therapy failure combinations because of the small number of available RCTs.

   CONCLUSIONS: Moderate-quality evidence supports the choice of a third-line agent only in patients on metformin combined with a SU or a TZD, with SGLT-2 inhibitors performing generally better than other drugs. In suggesting third-line agents, future guidelines should recognize the widely differing evidence on the various dual therapy failures. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Abstract
  This prospective, multicentre, phase III study (NCT02104804) evaluated the efficacy and safety of saxagliptin add-on therapy in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled by insulin +/- metformin. Patients with glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) 7.5% to 10.5% and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) <15 mmol/L (270 mg/dL) on stable insulin therapy (20-150 U/d) were randomized (1:1) to saxagliptin 5 mg once daily (N = 232) or placebo (N = 230) for 24 weeks, stratified by metformin use. The primary efficacy measure was change in HbA1c. Saxagliptin treatment resulted in a greater adjusted mean change in HbA1c from baseline to week 24 than placebo (-0.58%; P < .001), irrespective of metformin use, and a greater mean change in FPG (0.9 mmol/L [-15.9 mg/dL]; P < .001). More patients achieved HbA1c <7% with saxagliptin (11.4%) than with placebo (3.5%, P = .002). Adverse events and incidence of hypoglycaemia were similar in both groups. Overall, add-on saxagliptin 5 mg once daily significantly improved glycaemic control without increasing hypoglycaemia risk and was well tolerated in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled by insulin (+/- metformin).

Abstract
  Limited medication adherence and persistence with treatment are barriers to successful management of type 2 diabetes (T2D). We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, the Register of Controlled Trials, PsychINFO and CINAHL for observational and interventional studies that compared the adherence or persistence associated with 2 or more glucose-lowering medications in people with T2D. Where 5 or more studies provided the same comparison, a random-effects meta-analysis was performed, reporting mean difference (MD) or odds ratio (OR) for adherence or persistence, depending on the pooled study outcomes. We included a total of 48 studies. Compared with metformin, adherence (%) was better for sulphonylureas (5 studies; MD 10.6%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 6.5-14.7) and thiazolidinediones (TZDs; 6 studies; MD 11.3%, 95% CI 2.7%-20.0%). Adherence to TZDs was marginally better than adherence to sulphonylureas (5 studies; MD 1.5%, 95% CI 0.1-2.9). Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors had better adherence than sulphonylureas and TZDs. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists had higher rates of discontinuation than long-acting analogue insulins (6 studies; OR 1.95; 95% CI 1.17-3.27). Long-acting insulin analogues had better persistence than human insulins (5 studies; MD 43.1 days; 95% CI 22.0-64.2). The methods used to define adherence and persistence were highly variable.

Abstract
  AIM: To analyze the efficacy and safety of replacing sitagliptin with canagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and poor metabolic control despite treatment with sitagliptin in combination with metformin and/or gliclazide.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this multicentre observational, retrospective, 26-week clinical study of patients with T2D and poor glycaemic control (HbA1c: 7.5-9.5%) treated with sitagliptin in combination with metformin and/or gliclazide, sitagliptin (and gliclazide if appropriate) were replaced by canagliflozin. The main outcome of the study was the proportion of patients who achieved good glycaemic control (HbA1c<7%) by the end of the study.

   RESULTS: The study sample comprised 50 patients (baseline HbA1c 8.0+/-0.6%) treated with sitagliptin 100mg/day, 14 of whom were also taking gliclazide 60mg/day while 38 were taking metformin 1700mg/day. Sitagliptin treatment was replaced by either canagliflozin 100mg (n=17) or 300mg (n=33). After 26 weeks of follow-up, these patients presented with significant decreases in HbA1c (-1.1%; P<0.000), weight (-3.89kg; P<0.000), BMI (-1.37kg/m2; P<0.022), abdominal circumference (-5.42cm; P<0.004), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (-5.3mmHg and -4.4mmHg, respectively; P=0.005), triglycerides (-42mg/dL; P=0.005) and LDL/HDL cholesterol ratio (-0.34; P=0.005). By the end of the study, 42% of patients had achieved HbA1c levels<7%.

   CONCLUSION: In patients with T2D poorly controlled with sitagliptin, whether alone or in combination with metformin and/or gliclazide, replacing it with canagliflozin may be a simple yet effective intensification strategy. Our results, which may have important implications for clinical practice, now need to be confirmed in larger observational studies. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors improve glycaemic control and reduce bodyweight in patients with type 2 diabetes through different mechanisms. We assessed the safety and efficacy of the addition of the once-weekly GLP-1 receptor agonist dulaglutide to the ongoing treatment regimen in patients whose diabetes is inadequately controlled with SGLT2 inhibitors, with or without metformin.

   METHODS: AWARD-10 was a phase 3b, double-blind, parallel-arm, placebo-controlled, 24-week study done at 40 clinical sites in Austria, Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Israel, Mexico, Spain, and the USA. Eligible adult patients (>=18 years) with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes (HbA1c concentration >=7.0% [53 mmol/mol] and <=9.5% [80 mmol/mol]), a BMI of 45 kg/m2 or less, and taking stable doses (>3 months) of an SGLT2 inhibitor (with or without metformin) were randomly assigned (1:1:1) via an interactive web-response system to subcutaneous injections of either dulaglutide 1.5 mg, dulaglutide 0.75 mg, or placebo once per week for 24 weeks. Patients and investigators were masked to dulaglutide and placebo assignment, and those assessing outcomes were masked to study drug assignment. The primary objective was to test for the superiority of dulaglutide (1.5 mg or 0.75 mg) versus placebo for change in HbA1c concentration from baseline at 24 weeks. All analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population, defined as all randomly assigned patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02597049.

   FINDINGS: Between Dec 7, 2015, and Feb 3, 2017, 424 patients were randomly assigned to dulaglutide 1.5 mg (n=142), dulaglutide 0.75 mg (n=142), and placebo (n=140). One patient in the dulaglutide 0.75 mg group was excluded from the analysis because they did not receive any dose of the study drug. The reduction in HbA1c concentration at 24 weeks was larger in patients receiving dulaglutide (least squares mean [LSM] for dulaglutide 1.5 mg -1.34% [SE 0.06] or -14.7 mmol/mol [0.6]; dulaglutide 0.75 mg -1.21% [0.06] or -13.2 mmol/mol [0.6]) than in patients receiving placebo (-0.54% [0.06] or -5.9 mmol/mol [0.6]; p<0.0001 for both groups vs placebo). The LSM differences were -0.79% (95% CI -0.97 to -0.61) or -8.6 mmol/mol (-10.6 to -6.7) for dulaglutide 1.5 mg and -0.66% (-0.84 to -0.49) or -7.2 mmol/mol (-9.2 to -5.4) for dulaglutide 0.75 mg (p<0.0001 for both). Serious adverse events were reported for five (4%) patients in the dulaglutide 1.5 mg group, three (2%) patients in the dulaglutide 0.75 mg group, and five (4%) patients in the placebo group. Treatment-emergent adverse events were more common in patients treated with dulaglutide than in patients who received placebo, mainly because of an increased incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events. Nausea (21 [15%] patients in the dulaglutide 1.5 mg group vs seven [5%] in the dulaglutide 0.75 mg group vs five [4%] in the placebo group), diarrhoea (eight [6%] vs 14 [10%] vs four [3%]), and vomiting (five [4%] vs four [3%] vs one [1%]) were more common with dulaglutide than with placebo. One episode of severe hypoglycaemia was reported in the dulaglutide 0.75 mg group. Two (1%) patients receiving dulaglutide 1.5 mg died, but these deaths were not considered to be related to study drug; no deaths occurred in the other groups.

   INTERPRETATION: Dulaglutide as add-on treatment to SGLT2 inhibitors (with or without metformin) resulted in significant and clinically relevant improvements in glycaemic control, with acceptable tolerability that is consistent with the established safety profile of dulaglutide.

Abstract
  Context: Little is known about reproductive function in girls with youth-onset type 2 diabetes.

   Objectives: To characterize girls with irregular menses and effects of glycemic treatments on menses and sex steroids in the Treatment Options for Type 2 Diabetes in Youth (TODAY) study.

   Design: Differences in demographic, metabolic, and hormonal characteristics between regular- vs irregular-menses groups were tested; treatment group (metformin with or without rosiglitazone, metformin plus lifestyle) effect on menses and sex steroids over time in the study was assessed. This is a secondary analysis of TODAY data.

   Setting: Multicenter study in an academic setting.

   Patients: TODAY girls not receiving hormonal contraception and those at least 1-year postmenarche were included. Irregular menses was defined as three or fewer periods in the prior 6 months.

   Results: Of eligible participants with serum measurement of sex steroids (n = 190; mean age, 14 years), 21% had irregular menses. Those with irregular vs regular menses had higher body mass index (BMI) (P = 0.001), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (P = 0.001), free androgen index (P = 0.0003), and total testosterone (P = 0.01) and lower sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) (P = 0.004) and estradiol (P = 0.01). Differences remained after adjustment for BMI. There was no treatment group effect on menses or sex steroids at 12 or 24 months, and no association of sex steroids was seen with measures of insulin sensitivity or secretion.

   Conclusions: Menstrual dysfunction is common in girls with recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes and associated with alterations in sex steroids, SHBG, and AST but not with alteration in insulin sensitivity or beta-cell function and did not improve with 2 years of antihyperglycemic treatment.

Abstract
  Context: Combination therapy with insulin and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) is important for treating type 2 diabetes (T2D). This trial assesses the efficacy and safety of semaglutide, a GLP-1RA, as an add-on to basal insulin.

   Objective: To demonstrate the superiority of semaglutide vs placebo on glycemic control as an add-on to basal insulin in patients with T2D.

   Design: Phase 3a, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 30-week trial.

   Setting: This study included 90 sites in five countries.

   Patients: We studied 397 patients with uncontrolled T2D receiving stable therapy with basal insulin with or without metformin.

   Interventions: Subcutaneous semaglutide 0.5 or 1.0 mg once weekly or volume-matched placebo.

   Main Outcome Measures: Primary endpoint was change in glycated Hb (HbA1c) from baseline to week 30. Confirmatory secondary endpoint was change in body weight from baseline to week 30.

   Results: At week 30, mean HbA1c reductions [mean baseline value, 8.4% (67.9 mmol/mol)] with semaglutide 0.5 and 1.0 mg were 1.4% (15.8 mmol/mol) and 1.8% (20.2 mmol/mol) vs 0.1% (1.0 mmol/mol) with placebo [estimated treatment difference (ETD) vs placebo, -1.35 (14.8 mmol/mol); 95% CI, -1.61 to -1.10 and ETD, -1.75% (19.2 mmol/mol); 95% CI, -2.01 to -1.50; both P < 0.0001]. Severe or blood glucose-confirmed hypoglycemic episodes were reported in 11 patients (17 events) and 14 patients (25 events) with semaglutide 0.5 and 1.0 mg, respectively, vs seven patients (13 events) with placebo (estimated rate ratio vs placebo, 2.08; 95% CI, 0.67 to 6.51 and estimated rate ratio vs placebo, 2.41; 95% CI, 0.84 to 6.96 for 0.5 and 1.0 mg; both P = nonsignificant). Mean body weight decreased with semaglutide 0.5 and 1.0 mg vs placebo from baseline to end of treatment: 3.7, 6.4, and 1.4 kg (ETD, -2.31; 95% CI, -3.33 to -1.29 and ETD, -5.06; 95% CI, -6.08 to -4.04 kg; both P < 0.0001). Premature treatment discontinuation due to adverse events was higher for semaglutide 0.5 and 1.0 mg vs placebo (4.5%, 6.1%, and 0.8%), mainly due to gastrointestinal disorders.

   Conclusions: Semaglutide, added to basal insulin, significantly reduced HbA1c and body weight in patients with uncontrolled T2D vs placebo.

Abstract
  This international, randomized, double-blind trial (NCT01864174) compared the efficacy and safety of metformin extended-release (XR) and immediate-release (IR) in patients with type 2 diabetes. After a 4-week placebo lead-in, pharmacotherapy-naive adults with glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) at 7.0% to 9.2% were randomized (1:1) to receive once-daily metformin XR 2000 mg or twice-daily metformin IR 1000 mg for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was change in HbA1c after 24 weeks. Secondary endpoints were change in fasting plasma glucose (FPG), mean daily glucose (MDG) and patients (%) with HbA1c <7.0% after 24 weeks. Overall, 539 patients were randomized (metformin XR, N = 268; metformin IR, N = 271). Adjusted mean changes in HbA1c, FPG, MDG and patients (%) with HbA1c <7.0% after 24 weeks were similar for XR and IR: -0.93% vs -0.96%; -21.1 vs -20.6 mg/dL (-1.2 vs -1.1 mmol/L); -24.7 vs -27.1 mg/dL (-1.4 vs -1.5 mmol/L); and 70.9% vs 72.0%, respectively. Adverse events were similar between groups and consistent with previous studies. Overall, metformin XR demonstrated efficacy and safety similar to that of metformin IR over 24 weeks, with the advantage of once-daily dosing. Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

Abstract
  AIMS: Discovery of the specific bile acid receptors farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (TGR5) in enteroendocrine L cells has prompted research focusing on the impact of bile acids on glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion and glucose metabolism. The aim of the present study was to assess the GLP-1 secretory and gluco-metabolic effects of endogenously released bile, with and without concomitant administration of the bile acid-sequestering resin, sevelamer, in patients with type 2 diabetes.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded cross-over study including 15 metformin-treated patients with type 2 diabetes. During 4 experimental study days, either sevelamer 3200 mg or placebo in combination with intravenous infusion of cholecystokinin (CCK) (0.4 pmol sulfated CCK-8/kg/min) or saline was administered in randomized order. The primary endpoint was plasma GLP-1 excursions as measured by incremental area under the curve. Secondary endpoints included plasma responses of glucose, triglycerides, insulin, CCK, fibroblast growth factor-19 and 7alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (C4). In addition, gallbladder dynamics, gastric emptying, resting energy expenditure, appetite and ad libitum food intake were assessed.

   RESULTS: CCK-mediated gallbladder emptying was demonstrated to elicit a significant induction of GLP-1 secretion compared to saline, whereas concomitant single-dose administration of the bile acid sequestrant sevelamer was shown to eliminate the acute bile acid-induced increase in plasma GLP-1 excursions.

   CONCLUSIONS: Single-dose administration of sevelamer eliminated bile acid-mediated GLP-1 secretion in patients with type 2 diabetes, which could be explained by reduced bile acid stimulation of the basolaterally localized TGR5 on enteroendocrine L cells. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Abstract
  AIMS: To assess the effects on glycaemic control of lixisenatide vs placebo as add-on treatment to basal insulin (BI) +/- metformin and effects on glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) reduction in patients with insufficiently controlled type 2 diabetes (T2D).

   METHODS: Patients (n = 448) with inadequately controlled T2D were randomized (1:1) to lixisenatide or placebo as add-on to BI +/- metformin for 24 weeks after an 8-week run-in phase, during which BI was titrated to a target self-monitored plasma glucose (SMPG; 4.4-5.6 mmol/L). The primary endpoint was absolute change in HbA1c from baseline to week 24. Secondary efficacy endpoints included: percentage of responders; changes in 2-hour postprandial plasma glucose (PPG); 7-point SMPG (daily average); body weight (BW); total daily BI dose; fasting plasma glucose; and safety assessments.

   RESULTS: Baseline demographics were similar in the two treatment groups. After insulin optimization during run-in, lixisenatide was superior to placebo in mean change from baseline (7.9% [standard deviation {s.d.}, 0.66] and 7.9% [0.70], respectively) to week 24 in HbA1c (least squares mean [standard error {s.e.}] change -0.62% [0.09] vs -0.11% [0.09]; P < .0001, respectively) and higher proportions of patients achieved HbA1c targets. Two-hour PPG, daily mean SMPG and mean BW were reduced further and daily BI dose was lower with lixisenatide than placebo (-1.12 kg vs 0.04 kg [P < .0001]; -3.0 U vs -1.9 U [P = .0033], respectively). Treatment-emergent adverse events were greater with lixisenatide than placebo (63.8% vs 40.8%, respectively). The incidence of symptomatic hypoglycaemia was similar (lixisenatide 15.6% vs placebo 13.5%).

   CONCLUSIONS: In Asian patients insufficiently controlled on BI +/- metformin, lixisenatide was superior to placebo in glycaemic control, with a tolerability profile in line with other glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists.

Abstract
  This study aimed to assess the effect of luseogliflozin on liver fat deposition and compare luseogliflozin to metformin in type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Thirty-two T2D patients with NAFLD diagnosed by computed tomography or abdominal sonography were recruited. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either luseogliflozin (2.5 mg, newly administered) or metformin (1500 mg, newly or additionally administrated). Data on the liver-to-spleen attenuation ratio (L/S), visceral fat area, body mass index, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), fasting plasma glucose, C-peptide immunoreactivity (CPR), and CPR index were collected at baseline and after 6 months. The change in L/S was significantly greater in the luseogliflozin group than in the metformin group. Similarly, the changes in the visceral fat area, HbA1c, and body mass index were significantly greater in the luseogliflozin group than in the metformin group. The changes in ALT, fasting glucose, CPR, and CPR index were not significant in both groups. In conclusion, luseogliflozin significantly reduced liver fat deposition as compared to metformin, which may indicate clinical relevant benefits for NAFLD. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Abstract
  AIMS: To compare the efficacy and safety of adding the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist exenatide once weekly (QW) 2 mg or placebo among patients with type 2 diabetes who were inadequately controlled despite titrated insulin glargine (IG) +/- metformin.

   METHODS: This multicentre, double-blind study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02229383) randomized (1:1) patients with persistent hyperglycaemia after an 8-week titration phase (glycated haemoglobin [HbA1c] 7.0%-10.5% [53-91 mmol/mol]) to exenatide QW or placebo. The primary endpoint was HbA1c change from baseline to week 28. Secondary endpoints included body weight, 2-hour postprandial glucose, and mean daily IG dose.

   RESULTS: Of 464 randomized patients (mean: age, 58 years; HbA1c, 8.5% [69 mmol/mol]; diabetes duration, 11.3 years), 91% completed 28 weeks. Exenatide QW + IG vs placebo + IG significantly reduced HbA1c (least-squares mean difference, -0.73% [-8.0 mmol/mol]; 95% confidence interval, -0.93%, -0.53% [-10.2, -5.8 mmol/mol]; P < .001; final HbA1c, 7.55% [59 mmol/mol] and 8.24% [67 mmol/mol], respectively); body weight (-1.50 kg; -2.17, -0.84; P < .001); and 2-hour postprandial glucose (-1.52 mmol/L [-27.5 mg/dL]; -2.15, -0.90 [-38.7, -16.2]; P < .001). Significantly more exenatide QW + IG-treated patients vs placebo + IG-treated patients reached HbA1c <7.0% (<53 mmol/mol) (32.5% vs 7.4%; P < .001); daily IG dose increased by 2 and 4 units, respectively. Gastrointestinal and injection-site adverse events were more frequent with exenatide QW + IG (15.1% and 7.8%, respectively) than with placebo + IG (10.8% and 3.0%, respectively); hypoglycaemia incidence was similar between the exenatide QW + IG (29.7%) and placebo + IG (29.0%) groups, with no major hypoglycaemic events.

   CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with inadequate glycaemic control, exenatide QW significantly improved glucose control and decreased body weight, without increased hypoglycaemia or unexpected safety findings.

Abstract
  AIMS: To assess potential causes of metformin intolerance, including altered metformin uptake from the intestine, increased anaerobic glucose utilization and subsequent lactate production, altered serotonin uptake, and altered bile acid pool.

   METHODS: For this pharmacokinetic study, we recruited 10 severely intolerant and 10 tolerant individuals, matched for age, sex and body mass index. A single 500-mg dose of metformin was administered, with blood sampling at 12 time points over 24 hours. Blood samples were analysed for metformin, lactate, serotonin and bile acid concentrations, and compared across the phenotypes.

   RESULTS: The intolerant individuals were severely intolerant to 500 mg metformin. No significant difference was identified between tolerant and intolerant cohorts in metformin pharmacokinetics: median (interquartile range [IQR]) peak concentration 2.1 (1.7-2.3) mg/L and 2.0 (1.8-2.2) mg/L, respectively (P = .76); time to peak concentration 2.5 hours; median (IQR) area under the curve (AUC)0-24 16.9 (13.9-18.6) and 13.9 (12.9-16.8) mg/L*h, respectively (P = .72). Lactate concentration peaked at 3.5 hours, with mean peak concentration of 2.4 mmol/L in both cohorts (95% CI 2.0-2.8 and 1.8-3.0 mmol/L, respectively), and similar incremental AUC0-24 in each cohort: tolerant cohort 6.98 (95% CI 3.03-10.93) and intolerant cohort 4.47 (95% CI -3.12-12.06) mmol/L*h (P = .55). Neither serotonin nor bile acid concentrations were significantly different.

   CONCLUSIONS: Despite evidence of severe intolerance in our cohort, there was no significant difference in metformin pharmacokinetics or systemic measures of lactate, serotonin or bile acids. This suggests that metformin intolerance may be attributable to local factors within the lumen or enterocyte. Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

Abstract
  AIMS: To perform meta-analyses of studies evaluating the risk of pre-eclampsia in high-risk insulin-resistant women taking metformin prior to, or during pregnancy.

   METHODS: A search was conducted of the Medline, EMBASE, Web of Science and Scopus databases. Both randomized controlled trials and prospective observational cohort studies of metformin treatment vs. placebo/control or insulin either prior to or during pregnancy were selected. The main outcome measure was the incidence of pre-eclampsia in each treatment group.

   RESULTS: Overall, in five randomized controlled trials comparing metformin treatment (n = 611) with placebo/control (n = 609), no difference in the risk of pre-eclampsia was found [combined/pooled risk ratio (RR), 0.86 (95% CI 0.33-2.26); P = 0.76; I2 = 66%]. Meta-analysis of four cohort studies again showed no significant effect [RR, 1.21 (95% CI 0.56-2.61); P = 0.62; I2 = 30%]. A meta-analysis of eight randomized controlled trials comparing metformin (n = 838) with insulin (n = 836), however, showed a reduced risk of pre-eclampsia with metformin [RR, 0.68 (95% CI 0.48-0.95); P = 0.02; I2 = 0%]. No heterogeneity was present in the metformin vs. insulin analysis of randomized controlled trials, whereas high levels of heterogeneity were present in studies comparing metformin with placebo/control. Pre-eclampsia was a secondary outcome in most of the studies. The mean weight gain from time of enrolment to delivery was lower in the metformin group (P = 0.05, metformin vs. placebo; P = 0.004, metformin vs. insulin).

   CONCLUSIONS: In studies randomizing pregnant women to glucose-lowering therapy, metformin was associated with lower gestational weight gain and a lower risk of pre-eclampsia compared with insulin. Copyright © 2017 Diabetes UK.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Placebo was defined as any therapy that is used for its nonspecific psychological and physiologic effect but has no specific pharmacologic impact on the condition being treated. Besides medication therapies, studies have found that the optimal dietary approach as well as physical activity and education are useful to control hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). The aim of this study was to evaluate the placebo effects of antidiabetic therapies in Asian and Caucasian T2DM patients and make a comparison between the two ethnicities.

   METHODS: A search using the MEDLINE database, EMBASE, and Cochrane Database was performed, from when recording began until December 2016. The main concepts searched in English were sulfonylurea (SU); alpha glucosidase inhibitors (AGI); metformin (MET); thiazolidinediones (TZD); dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4i); sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i); glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA); type 2 diabetes (T2DM); placebo controlled; and randomized controlled trials. Using the Cochrane instrument, we evaluated the adequacy of randomization, allocation concealment procedures, and blinding.

   RESULTS: This study included 63 studies with a total of 7096 Asian patients involved and 262 studies with a total of 27,477 Caucasian patients involved. In Caucasian population, the use of placebo led to significant reductions of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), -0.683% (P = 0.008) in SU monotherapy treatment, -0.193% (P = 0.001) in DPP-4i treatment, and -0.230% (P < 0.001) in SGLT2i treatment, respectively. In Asian population, the use of placebo resulted in significant decreases of HbA1c, -0.162% (P = 0.012) in DPP-4i treatment and -0.269% (P = 0.028) in GLP-1RA add-on therapy, respectively. The placebo also significantly reduced body weight. In Caucasian population, placebo use resulted in 0.833 kg (P = 0.006) weight loss by SU treatment and 0.953 kg (P = 0.006) weight loss by GLP-1RA treatment. In Asian population, the placebo led to a weight change of 0.612 kg (P < 0.001) by GLP-1RA analog treatment. The changes of HbA1c and weight due to the placebo effect in other treatments were not significant in both Asian and Caucasian population. Comparisons of the placebo effect on HbA1c change and weight change in each treatment group indicated that no significant difference was found between Asian and Caucasian population.

   CONCLUSIONS: The overall differences of the placebo effect on HbA1c changes as well as on body weight changes were not significant between Asian and Caucasian T2DM patients. The placebo effect on HbA1c changes and weight changes was not associated with baseline age, gender, baseline body mass index, baseline HbA1c, duration of diabetes, or study duration.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To provide recommendations on the effect of antidiabetic drugs on bone fragility to help select the most adequate antidiabetic treatment, especially in diabetic patients with high risk of fracture.

   PARTICIPANTS: Members of the Bone Metabolism Working Group of the Spanish Society of Endocrinology.

   METHODS: The GRADE system (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) was used to establish both the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence. A systematic search was made in MEDLINE (Pubmed) using the following terms associated to the name of each antidiabetic drug: AND "osteoporosis", "fractures", "bone mineral density", "bone markers", "calciotropic hormones". Papers in English with publication date before 30 April 2016 were reviewed. Recommendations were jointly discussed by the Working Group.

   CONCLUSIONS: The document summaries the data on the potential effects of antidiabetic drugs on bone metabolism and fracture risk. Copyright © 2017 SEEN. Publicado por Elsevier Espana, S.L.U. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: This analysis compared the efficacy and safety of the sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, dapagliflozin, and the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitor, saxagliptin, both added on to metformin.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a post-hoc analysis from a double-blind, randomized, 24-week clinical trial (NCT01606007) of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) inadequately controlled with metformin. We compared the dapagliflozin 10 mg (n = 179) and saxagliptin 5 mg (n = 176) treatment arms.

   RESULTS: Dapagliflozin showed significantly greater mean reductions versus saxagliptin in HbA1c (difference versus saxagliptin [95% CI]: -0.32% [-0.54, -0.10]; p < 0.005), fasting plasma glucose (-0.98 [-1.42, -0.54] mmol/L; p < 0.0001), body weight (-2.39 [-3.08, -1.71] kg; p < 0.0001) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) (-3.89 [-6.15, -1.63] mmHg; p < 0.001). More dapagliflozintreated than saxagliptin-treated patients achieved the composite endpoint of HbA1c reduction >= 0.5%, weight loss >= 2 kg, SBP reduction >= 2 mmHg and no major/minor hypoglycemia (24% versus 7%). No major events of hypoglycemia were reported. More patients on dapagliflozin (6%) versus saxagliptin (0.6%) experienced genital infections.

   CONCLUSION: Dapagliflozin demonstrated greater glycemic efficacy than saxagliptin with additional benefits on weight and SBP, and the safety profile was consistent with previous studies.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: Among patients with type 2 diabetes uncontrolled with metformin, exenatide once weekly (QW) plus dapagliflozin combination produced greater reductions in glycemia, weight, and systolic blood pressure (SBP) at 28 weeks than exenatide QW or dapagliflozin alone (DURATION-8). Here, we investigated the safety and maintenance of efficacy at 52 weeks, after a 24-week extension.

   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This phase 3, multicenter, double-blind study randomized adults with type 2 diabetes (with glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c] 8.0-12.0% [64-108 mmol/mol] and on metformin >=1,500 mg/day) to exenatide QW (2-mg subcutaneous injection) plus once-daily dapagliflozin (10-mg oral tablet), exenatide QW plus oral placebo, or dapagliflozin plus injected placebo. Extension-period P values were nominal.

   RESULTS: Of 1,375 patients screened, 695 were randomized (mean baseline HbA1c 9.3% [78 mmol/mol]); 81.2% completed the study, and 75.3% completed treatment. At 52 weeks, HbA1c reductions were greater with exenatide QW plus dapagliflozin (least squares mean change -1.75% [-19.1 mmol/mol]) versus exenatide QW (-1.38% [-15.1 mmol/mol]; P = 0.006) or dapagliflozin (-1.23% [-13.4 mmol/mol]; P < 0.001); mean HbA1c values were 6.9% (52 mmol/mol), 7.2% (55 mmol/mol), and 7.4% (57 mmol/mol), respectively. Weight and SBP reductions were greater with exenatide QW plus dapagliflozin (-3.31 kg and -4.5 mmHg) versus exenatide QW (-1.51 kg and -0.7 mmHg; both P < 0.001) but similar to those with dapagliflozin (-2.28 kg and -2.7 mmHg; P = 0.057 and P = 0.100, respectively). The exenatide QW plus dapagliflozin regimen was well tolerated with no unexpected safety findings; more patients treated with exenatide QW experienced gastrointestinal and injection site-related adverse events. No major hypoglycemia occurred.

   CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with type 2 diabetes uncontrolled with metformin, exenatide QW plus dapagliflozin provided sustained improvements in glycemia, weight, and SBP over 52 weeks, with no unexpected safety findings. Copyright © 2018 by the American Diabetes Association.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the comparative efficacy and safety of saxagliptin for type 2 diabetes (T2D).

   METHODS: A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov and two Chinese databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing saxagliptin with placebo or active comparators was performed up to July 2017. A complementary search was done to cover literature until March 2018. For continuous data, estimates were pooled using inverse variance methodology to calculate weighted mean differences (WMDs). Dichotomous data were presented as Mantel-Haenzel risk ratios (RRs).

   RESULTS: Thirty-nine references of 30 RCTs involving 29,938 patients were analyzed. Compared with placebo, saxagliptin significantly reduced glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c, WMD -0.52%, 95% CI -0.60 to -0.44) and fasting plasma glucose (WMD -13.78 mg/dL, 95% CI -15.31 to -12.25), and increased the proportion of patients achieving HbA1c <7% (RR 1.64, 95% CI 1.53 to 1.75). When combined with submaximal-dose metformin, saxagliptin significantly increased the proportion of patients achieving HbA1c <7% compared with acarbose (RR 2.38, 95% CI 1.17 to 4.83) and uptitrated metformin (RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.63). Saxagliptin was similar to other DPP-4 inhibitors but inferior to liraglutide and dapagliflozin on glycemic control. Saxagliptin significantly decreased the incidences of overall adverse events compared with acarbose (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.89) and liraglutide (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.71) when added to metformin. Weight gain and hypoglycemia with saxagliptin was slightly but significantly higher than placebo and lower than sulfonylureas. Saxagliptin did not increase the risk of arthralgia, heart failure, pancreatitis and other adverse events.

   CONCLUSIONS: Generally, saxagliptin has similar efficacy compared with most oral antidiabetic drugs and may be more effective than acarbose, while having a better safety profile than both acarbose and sulfonylureas.

Abstract
  n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) might regulate metabolism by lowering endocannabinoid levels. We examined time-dependent changes in adipose tissue levels of endocannabinoids as well as in parameters of glucose homeostasis induced by n-3 PUFA in dietary-obese mice, and compared these results with the effect of n-3 PUFA intervention in type 2 diabetic (T2DM) subjects. Male C57BL/6J mice were fed for 8, 16 or 24weeks a high-fat diet alone (cHF) or supplemented with n-3 PUFA (cHF+F). Overweight/obese, T2DM patients on metformin therapy were given for 24weeks corn oil (Placebo; 5g/day) or n-3 PUFA concentrate as above (Omega-3; 5g/day). Endocannabinoids were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass-spectrometry. Compared to cHF-fed controls, the cHF+F mice consistently reduced 2-arachidonoylglycerol (up to ~2-fold at week 24) and anandamide (~2-fold) in adipose tissue, while the levels of endocannabinoid-related anti-inflammatory molecules N-eicosapentaenoyl ethanolamine (EPEA) and N-docosahexaenoyl ethanolamine (DHEA) increased more than ~10-fold and ~8-fold, respectively. At week 24, the cHF+F mice improved glucose tolerance and fasting blood glucose, the latter being positively correlated with adipose 2-arachidonoylglycerol levels only in obese cHF-fed controls, like fasting insulin and HOMA-IR. In the patients, n-3 PUFA failed to reduce 2-arachidonoylglycerol and anandamide levels in adipose tissue and serum, but they increased both adipose tissue and serum levels of EPEA and DHEA. In conclusion, the inability of n-3 PUFA to reduce adipose tissue and serum levels of classical endocannabinoids might contribute to a lack of beneficial effects of these lipids on glucose homeostasis in T2DM patients.

Abstract
  This analysis assessed whether responses with exenatide once weekly plus dapagliflozin (n = 231), exenatide once weekly alone (n = 230), or dapagliflozin alone (n = 233) differed in key patient subpopulations of the DURATION-8 trial. Potential treatment-by-subgroup interactions for changes in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and body weight after 28 weeks were evaluated among subgroups determined by baseline HbA1c, age, sex, body mass index, type 2 diabetes duration, race, ethnicity and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Exenatide once weekly plus dapagliflozin reduced HbA1c and body weight across all subgroups: least-squares mean reductions ranged from -8.4 to -26.1 mmol/mol (-0.77% to -2.39%) for HbA1c and from -2.07 to -4.55 kg for body weight. Potential treatment-by-subgroup interactions (P < .10) were found for HbA1c change by age (P = .016) and eGFR (P = .097). Age subgroup analysis findings were not consistent with expected mechanistic effects, with the small number of patients aged >=65 years (n = 74 vs n = 499 for patients aged <65 years) limiting the interpretability of the interaction term. In the exenatide once weekly plus dapagliflozin and dapagliflozin groups, but not the exenatide once weekly group, HbA1c reductions were greater among patients with eGFR >=90 vs >=60 to <90 mL/min/1.73 m2 (least-squares mean reductions of -23.6 vs -19.0 mmol/mol [-2.16% vs -1.74%], -17.3 vs -12.0 mmol/mol [-1.58% vs -1.10%], and -17.7 vs -16.9 mmol/mol [-1.62% vs -1.55%] for the respective treatments); this was consistent with the mechanism of action of dapagliflozin. A potential treatment-by-subgroup interaction was observed for change in body weight by sex (P = .099), with greater weight loss for women vs men across all treatments (range -2.56 to -3.98 kg vs -0.56 to -2.99 kg). In conclusion, treatment with exenatide once weekly plus dapagliflozin reduced HbA1c and body weight across all patient subgroups and was more effective than exenatide once weekly or dapagliflozin alone in all adequately sized subgroups.

Abstract
  The safety of triple oral therapy with dapagliflozin plus saxagliptin plus metformin versus dual therapy with dapagliflozin or saxagliptin plus metformin was compared in a post-hoc analysis of 3 randomized trials of sequential or concomitant add-on of dapagliflozin and saxagliptin to metformin. In the concomitant add-on trial, patients with type 2 diabetes on stable metformin received dapagliflozin 10 mg/d plus saxagliptin 5 mg/d. In sequential add-on trials, patients on metformin plus either saxagliptin 5 mg/d or dapagliflozin 10 mg/d received dapagliflozin 10 mg/d or saxagliptin 5 mg/d, respectively, as add-on therapy. After 24 weeks, incidences of adverse events and serious adverse events were similar between triple and dual therapy and between concomitant and sequential add-on regimens. Urinary tract infections were more common with sequential than with concomitant add-on therapy; genital infections were reported only with sequential add-on of dapagliflozin to saxagliptin plus metformin. Hypoglycaemia incidence was <2.0% across all analysis groups. In conclusion, the safety and tolerability of triple therapy with dapagliflozin, saxagliptin and metformin, as either concomitant or sequential add-on, were similar to dual therapy with either agent added to metformin.

Abstract
  We investigated the long-term efficacy and safety of gemigliptin and the efficacy and safety of gemigliptin treatment after once-daily treatment with sitagliptin 100 mg, in patients with type 2 diabetes. This was a 28-week extension of a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel study of gemigliptin or sitagliptin added to ongoing metformin therapy. After randomization to sitagliptin 100 mg qd (S), gemigliptin 25 mg bid (G1) or gemigliptin 50 mg qd (G2) and after completing 24 weeks of treatment, 118 patients switched from gemigliptin 25 mg bid to 50 mg qd (G1/G2), 111 patients continued gemigliptin 50 mg qd (G2/G2) and 106 patients switched from sitagliptin 100 mg qd to gemigliptin 50 mg qd (S/G2). All 3 treatments reduced glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) (S/G2,-0.99% [95% CI -1.25%, -0.73%]; G1/G2, -1.11% [95% CI -1.33%, -0.89%]; G2/G2, -1.06% [95% CI -1.28%, -0.85%]). The percentage of patients achieving HbA1c < 6.5% was 27.6% in the G1/G2 group at both Week 24 and Week 52, and ranged from 27.3% to 32.7% in the G2/G2 group (difference in proportions, 5% [95% CI -6%, 17%]), while it increased from 6.8% to 27.3% from Week 24 to Week 52 in the S/G2 group (difference in proportions, 20% [95% CI 7%, 34%]). Addition of gemigliptin 50 mg qd to metformin was shown to be efficacious for 52 weeks. Switching from sitagliptin 100 mg to gemigliptin 50 mg showed consistent glyacemic control over the previous treatment. Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Abstract
  AIM: This phase III, multicentre, randomized study (ClinicalTrials.gov; NCT01958671) evaluated the efficacy and safety of ertugliflozin monotherapy in adults with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes (glycated haemoglobin [HbA1c], 7.0% to 10.5% [53-91 mmol/mol]) despite diet and exercise.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: The 52-week study comprised a 26-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled period (Phase A) during which 461 participants received placebo, ertugliflozin 5 mg/d or ertugliflozin 15 mg/d. This was followed by a 26-week active-controlled period (Phase B) during which participants in the placebo group who had not received glycaemic rescue therapy had blinded metformin added. Results to Week 52 are reported. Because of the use of metformin in Phase B, no statistical comparisons of efficacy were made between the ertugliflozin and placebo/metformin groups at Week 52.

   RESULTS: The mean (standard error) change from baseline to Week 52 in HbA1c was -0.9% (0.1) and -1.0% (0.1) in the ertugliflozin 5 and 15 mg groups, respectively. The proportions of participants with HbA1c <7.0% at Week 52 were 25.6% and 28.5%, respectively. Ertugliflozin reduced fasting plasma glucose, body weight and systolic blood pressure (SBP). The incidence of genital mycotic infections (GMIs) in females was significantly higher in both ertugliflozin groups (5 mg, 26.9%; 15 mg, 29.0%) vs the placebo/metformin group (9.9%), and in males was significantly higher in the 15 mg group (7.8%) vs the placebo/metformin group (1.2%). Ertugliflozin was not associated with increased incidence of urinary tract infections, symptomatic hypoglycaemia or hypovolaemia adverse events compared with placebo/metformin.

   CONCLUSIONS: Ertugliflozin treatment over 52 weeks improved glycaemic control and reduced body weight and SBP, but increased GMIs. Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Abstract
  AIMS: To explore whether the pre-clinical findings that metformin improves lipid metabolism, possibly through modulation of intrahepatic partitioning of fatty acids towards oxidation and away from re-esterification and resecretion as triglycerides (TGs), can be translated to a human setting.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a 3-month randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trial in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D; n = 24) and healthy controls (n = 12). Patients with T2D received either placebo (placebo group) or 1000 mg metformin twice daily (metformin group), while healthy subjects were all treated with metformin (control group). Hepatic fatty acid metabolism was measured by [11 C]palmitate positron-emission tomography, hepatic TG secretion and peripheral oxidation by ex vivo labelled [1-14 C]VLDL-TG and VLDL particle size by TG/apolipoprotein B ratio. Body composition was assessed by dual-energy X-ray and whole-body lipid oxidation by indirect calorimetry.

   RESULTS: Metformin treatment for 3 months produced the anticipated decrease in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) in the metformin group (FPG 7.9 +/- 1.8 mM [study day 1] vs 6.4 +/- 1.1 mM [study day 2]), whereas patients in the placebo group and healthy controls had similar FPG levels before and after the trial (mixed model group vs time interaction; P = .003); however, contrary to our hypothesis, metformin treatment did not affect hepatic lipid metabolism or peripheral oxidation.

   CONCLUSION: The observed beneficial effects on lipid metabolism during metformin treatment in humans appear to be secondary to long-term alterations in body composition or glucose homeostasis. Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Abstract
  AIM: Pooled efficacy studies suggest that glycaemic responses to dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 inhibitors in type 2 diabetes are greatest in Asians, who may also respond better to alpha-glucosidase inhibitors. We assessed the glycaemic impact of sitagliptin by race in the Trial Evaluating Cardiovascular Outcomes with Sitagliptin (TECOS), and whether this was enhanced in Asians with concomitant acarbose therapy.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: TECOS enrolled 14 671 patients with type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and HbA1c of 48-64 mmol/mol (6.5%-8.0%), and randomized them, double-blind, to sitagliptin or placebo. There were 3265 patients (22.3%) from Asian countries. Background glucose-lowering therapies were unaltered for the first 4 months post randomization unless clinically essential, facilitating comparison of sitagliptin-associated effects in self-identified East Asian, Other (South) Asian, White Caucasian, Hispanic, Black and Indigenous groups.

   RESULTS: Median baseline HbA1c by race was 54 to 57 mmol/mol (7.1%-7.4%). Mean 4-month reduction in placebo-adjusted HbA1c was greatest in East Asians (-6.6 mmol/mol [-0.60%] vs <=6.0 mmol/mol [<=0.55%] in other groups), with significantly greater reduction vs the 2 largest groups (White Caucasians, Other Asians; P < .0001) after adjustment for covariates. After the first 4 months, East and Other Asians were more likely to initiate additional oral therapy (metformin and/or sulfonylureas) than insulin vs White Caucasians (P < .0001). Acarbose use increased in the Asian patients, but no glycaemic interaction with allocated study medication was observed (adjusted P = .12).

   CONCLUSIONS: The greatest initial reduction in HbA1c with sitagliptin in the TECOS population was in East Asians. No enhanced glycaemic effect was seen when sitagliptin was given with acarbose. Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Abstract
  AIMS: To test the hypothesis that "induction" intensive insulin therapy (IIT) needs to be followed by "maintenance therapy" to preserve beta-cell function, and to evaluate the impact on beta-cell function over 2 years of two approaches to maintenance therapy: intermittent short-term IIT every 3 months vs daily metformin.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this trial, 24 adults with a mean type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) duration of 2.0 +/- 1.7 years and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels 6.4 +/- 0.1% (46 +/- 1.1mmol/mol) were randomized to 3 weeks of induction IIT (glargine, lispro) followed by either repeat IIT for up to 2 weeks every 3 months or daily metformin. Participants underwent serial assessment of beta-cell function using the Insulin Secretion-Sensitivity Index-2 (ISSI-2) on an oral glucose tolerance test every 3 months.

   RESULTS: The primary outcome of baseline-adjusted ISSI-2 at 2 years was higher in the metformin arm compared with intermittent IIT (245.0 +/- 31.7 vs 142.2 +/- 18.4; P = .008). Baseline-adjusted HbA1c at 2 years (secondary outcome) was lower in the metformin arm (6.0 +/- 0.2% vs 7.3 +/- 0.2%; P = .0006) (42 +/- 2.2 vs 56 +/- 2.2mmol/mol). At study completion, 66.7% of participants randomized to metformin had an HbA1c concentration <= 6.0% (<=42mmol/mol), compared with 8.3% of those on intermittent IIT (P = .009). There were no differences in insulin sensitivity.

   CONCLUSION: After induction IIT, metformin was superior to intermittent IIT for maintaining beta-cell function and glycaemic control over 2 years. The strategy of induction and maintenance therapy to preserve beta-cell function warrants exploration in early T2DM. Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

  This post hoc analysis assessed the effects on cardiovascular risk factors of body weight, systolic blood pressure (SBP) and triglycerides after 28 weeks' treatment with exenatide once weekly plus dapagliflozin, as compared with exenatide once weekly or dapagliflozin, in patient subpopulations from the DURATION-8 trial of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) inadequately controlled with metformin alone. Subgroups of patients were stratified according to their baseline body weight, SBP and triglyceride levels. Body weight, SBP and triglyceride levels were reduced across most respective subgroups, with no significant subgroup-by-treatment interactions. For each treatment, weight loss was numerically greater as baseline body mass index increased. SBP reductions were greater among patients with SBP >=140 vs <140 mm Hg for exenatide once weekly plus dapagliflozin and exenatide once weekly. Reductions in triglyceride levels were greater among patients with baseline triglycerides <1.69 vs >=1.69 mmol/L for each treatment. The combination of exenatide once weekly plus dapagliflozin reduced cardiovascular risk factors across baseline subgroups for each variable to a greater extent than did either individual drug; the greatest effects were observed in the high baseline subgroups for body weight and SBP.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Case reports have suggested an association between dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4is) and development of bullous pemphigoid (BP).

   OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between DPP4i treatment and development of BP.

   METHODS: We conducted a retrospective 1:2 case-control study, comparing case patients with diabetes and BP with age- and sex-matched control patients with diabetes issued from Swiss (Bern) and French (Marseille) dermatologic departments from January 1, 2014, to July 31, 2016.

   RESULTS: We collected 61 case patients with diabetes and BP and 122 controls. DPP4is were associated with an increased risk for development of BP (adjusted odds ratio, 2.64; 95% confidence interval, 1.19-5.85; P = .02), with vildagliptin showing the highest adjusted odds ratio (3.57 [95% confidence interval, 1.07-11.84; P = .04]). Stratified analysis showed a stronger association in males and patients age 80 years or older. DPP4i withdrawal and the initiation of first-line treatments led to clinical remission in 95% of cases.

   LIMITATIONS: This was a retrospective study in tertiary referral hospitals. We focused the analysis on DPP4i intake, without analyzing the potential isolated effect of metformin.

   CONCLUSIONS: DPP4is, especially vildagliptin, are associated with an increased risk for development of BP. Their use needs to be carefully evaluated, particularly in high-risk patients, such as males and those age 80 years or older. Copyright © 2017 American Academy of Dermatology, Inc.

Abstract
  AIMS: To evaluate treatment satisfaction in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) not adequately controlled by metformin, randomized to ITCA 650 (continuous exenatide in osmotic mini-pump) vs twice-daily exenatide injections (Ex-BID).

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Diabetes Medication Satisfaction Tool (DM-SAT) was administered and assessments were made at baseline, Week 8 and Week 20 during a 24-week open-label phase 2 trial. In Stage I (Weeks 1-12), 155 patients, comprising the ITT population, were randomized to 3 groups: ITCA 650 20 mug/day, ITCA 650 40 mug/day and Ex-BID 10 mug BID. In Stage II (Weeks 13-24), ITCA 650 groups were re-randomized to either remain on the Stage I dose or receive a higher dose. Patients treated with Ex-BID were randomized to 40 or 60 mug/day ITCA 650.

   RESULTS: Patients using ITCA 650 reported significant increases in overall treatment satisfaction by Week 8 vs those using Ex-BID (P < .01), despite similar clinical efficacy and overall rates of nausea. During Stage II, further improvement in HbA1c and weight were seen after 3-fold dose escalation of ITCA 650 and treatment satisfaction was maintained. When patients using Ex-BID were switched to ITCA 650, treatment satisfaction increased and reached levels similar to those initially treated with ITCA 650. Neither GI side effects of nausea and/or vomiting, nor the procedure to sub-dermally place ITCA 650, significantly impacted treatment satisfaction scores.

   CONCLUSION: ITCA 650 added to metformin for patients with T2D, and for those who switched to ITCA 650 from Ex-BID, meaningfully improved glucose control and significantly increased overall treatment satisfaction. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Abstract
  In this trial, 390 insulin-treated patients with type 2 diabetes were randomized to either placebo or metformin. Fasting levels of glucose, insulin and C peptide were determined at baseline, after 4 months and yearly thereafter for 4 years to assess fasting estimates of beta cell function. The primary endpoint was the fasting C peptide-to-glucose ratio (FCPGR) and secondary measures were the disposition index (DI) and the fasting C peptide (FCP). We analysed the results with a general linear mixed model. Baseline FCPGR was 5.27 (95% CI, 4.83 - 5.71). Compared to placebo, FCPGR increased in the metformin group with 1.48 (95% CI, 1.09 - 1.87, P < 0.001). The DI showed comparable results with a treatment effect of 1.50 (95% CI, 1.17 - 1.83; P < 0.001). FCP also increased in the metformin group but did not reach statistical significance vs placebo (0.034 nmol, 95% CI, -0.005 - 0.072; P = 0.085). Treatment with metformin vs placebo, added to insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes, improves long-term estimates of beta cell function in the fasting state.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: A single insulin injection was shown to improve microcirculatory blood flow. Our aim was to examine the effects of 4weeks of insulin therapy by three randomly assigned insulin analog regimens (Detemir, Aspart, and their combination) on cutaneous blood flow (CBF) and microcirculatory endothelial function as an add-on to metformin in type 2 diabetic patients poorly controlled on oral antidiabetic treatment.

   METHODS: Fourty-two type 2 diabetic patients with no history of cardiovascular disease in secondary failure to oral antidiabetic agents had CBF measurements before and after acetylcholine (Ach) iontophoretic administration. CBF measurements were performed at fasting and after a standardized breakfast during the post-prandial period. Before randomization (Visit 1, V1) during the tests, participants took only metformin. The same tests were repeated after 4weeks of insulin treatment (Visit 2, V2).

   RESULTS: Thirty-four patients had good quality recordings for both visits. During V1, CBF and CBF response to Ach increased in the post-prandial period. After 4weeks of insulin treatment, metabolic parameters improved. Compared to V1, CBF at fasting did not increase at V2 but there was an improvement in endothelial function at fasting after Ach iontophoresis, without difference across insulin regimens. Oxidative stress markers were not modified, and E-selectin and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 levels decreased after insulin treatment, without differences between insulin groups.

   CONCLUSIONS: A strategy of improving glycemic control for 4weeks with insulin analogs improves microcirculatory endothelial reactivity and reduces endothelial biomarkers at fasting, whatever the insulin regimen used. Insulin therapy associated to metformin is able to improve fasting microvascular endothelial function even before complete metabolic control. Copyright © 2017. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Abstract
  Different strategies are increasingly used for early intervention in prediabetes in China, but the effects of these strategies on incident diabetes have not yet been confirmed. The aim of the present study was to assess systematically the effects of different strategies for preventing diabetes, aimed at Chinese people with prediabetes. Seven electronic databases were searched to identify eligible trials published from inception to September 20, 2016. Randomized controlled trials with a minimum follow-up duration of 6 months were included. Standard pairwise meta-analysis with a random-effects model and network meta-analysis with a frequentist framework were performed. A total of 63 studies, including 11 intervention strategies, were included. Compared with placebo, all strategies, except for lipid-affecting drugs and sitagliptin, reduced the rate of incident diabetes with different levels of effectiveness, ranging from 0.18 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.12, 0.27) to 0.39 (95% CI 0.20, 0.75). Ranking probability analysis indicated that metformin and beta-cell-stimulating drugs reduced the risk of diabetes most, with probabilities of 87.4% and 81%, respectively. Ethnicity and cultural factors should be considered for diabetes prevention. Most of the included trials were of poor methodological quality, however, and the results should be interpreted with caution. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Abstract
  Historically, metformin was withheld before surgery for fear of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. Currently, however, this risk is deemed to be low and guidelines have moved towards the continuation of metformin. We hypothesized that continuing metformin peri-operatively would lower postoperative serum glucose level without an effect on plasma lactate levels. We performed a single-blind multicentre randomized controlled trial in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus scheduled for non-cardiac surgery and continued (MF+ group) or withheld (MF- group) metformin before surgery. The main outcome measures were the differences in peri-operative plasma glucose and lactate levels. We randomized 70 patients (37 MF+ group and 33 MF- group) with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Postoperative glucose levels were similar in the MF+ and the MF- groups (8.2 +/- 1.8 vs 8.3 +/- 2.3 mmol/L P = .95) Although preoperative lactate levels were slightly higher in the MF+ group compared with the MF- group (1.5 vs 1.2 mmol/L; P = .02), the postoperative lactate levels were not significantly different (1.2 vs 1.0 mmol/L; P = .18). In conclusion, continuation of metformin during elective non-cardiac surgery does not improve glucose control or raise lactate levels to a clinically relevant degree.

Abstract
  AIM: To assess the efficacy and safety of saxagliptin plus metformin over 24 weeks in pharmacotherapy-naive Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and inadequate glycaemic control (HbA1c, 8.0%-12.0%).

   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this multicentre, double-blind, active-controlled study (The START study: NCT02273050, clinicaltrials.gov), patients were randomized (1:1:1) to saxagliptin 5 mg plus metformin, saxagliptin 5 mg plus placebo or metformin plus placebo. Saxagliptin was taken once daily; metformin was taken once/twice daily and was titrated from 500 mg to a maximum of 2000 mg/d over 8 weeks. The primary end point was change in HbA1c from baseline to Week 24.

   RESULTS: Data from 630 patients (66.5% men; mean age, 50.1 years; mean body mass index, 26.6 kg/m2 ; mean HbA1c, 9.4%; mean diabetes duration, 0.81 years) were analysed. Mean reduction in HbA1c was greater with saxagliptin plus metformin (-3.0%) than with saxagliptin plus placebo (-2.1%; P < .001) or metformin plus placebo (-2.8%; P = .034). Changes in mean fasting plasma glucose, 120-minute postprandial glucose, and 180-minute postprandial glucose area under the curve were greater, and more patients achieved a therapeutic glycaemic response, with saxagliptin plus metformin than with either monotherapy. Hypoglycaemic events were infrequent (<2%). Incidence of adverse events was similar among groups; upper respiratory tract infection and diarrhoea were most common.

   CONCLUSIONS: Saxagliptin 5 mg plus metformin significantly improved glycaemic control compared with either monotherapy in treatment-naive Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes, and was well tolerated. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this double-blind randomized study (Clinicaltrials.gov NCT02036515), patients (glycated haemoglobin [HbA1c] 7.0% to 10.5% [53-91 mmol/mol] receiving metformin >=1500 mg/d and sitagliptin 100 mg/d; estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] >=60 mL/min/1.73 m2 ) were randomized to ertugliflozin 5 mg once-daily, 15 mg once-daily or placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline in HbA1c at Week 26; treatment was continued until Week 52.

   RESULTS: A total of 464 patients were randomized (mean baseline HbA1c, 8.0% [64.3 mmol/mol]; eGFR, 87.9 mL/min/1.73 m2 ). After 26 weeks, placebo-adjusted least squares (LS) mean changes in HbA1c from baseline were -0.7% (-7.5 mmol/mol) and -0.8% (-8.3 mmol/mol) for ertugliflozin 5 and 15 mg, respectively (both P < .001); 17.0%, 32.1% and 39.9% of patients receiving placebo, ertugliflozin 5 mg or ertugliflozin 15 mg, respectively, had HbA1c <7.0% (53 mmol/mol). Significant reductions in fasting plasma glucose, body weight (BW) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) were observed with ertugliflozin relative to placebo. The positive effects of ertugliflozin on glycaemic control, BW and SBP were maintained through Week 52. A higher incidence of genital mycotic infections was observed in male and female patients receiving ertugliflozin (3.7%-14.1%) vs placebo (0%-1.9%) through Week 52. The incidence of urinary tract infections, symptomatic hypoglycaemia and hypovolaemia adverse events were not meaningfully different across groups.

   CONCLUSIONS: Ertugliflozin added to metformin and sitagliptin was well-tolerated, and provided clinically meaningful, durable glycaemic control, BW and SBP reductions vs placebo over 52 weeks. Copyright © 2017 The Authors. Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Abstract
  AIM: We evaluated the efficacy and safety of ertugliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor, in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) inadequately controlled (HbA1c, 7.0%-10.5%) with metformin monotherapy (>=1500 mg/d for >=8 weeks).

   METHODS: This was a double-blind, 26-week, multicentre study with ongoing 78-week extension (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02033889). A total of 621 participants were randomized 1:1:1 to placebo, or ertugliflozin 5 or 15 mg/d. The primary endpoint was change from baseline at week 26 in HbA1c. Secondary efficacy endpoints were change from baseline at week 26 in fasting plasma glucose (FPG), body weight, systolic/diastolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP) and number of participants with HbA1c <7.0% (53 mmol/mol). Pre-specified adverse events (AEs) of special interest and percent change from baseline in bone mineral density (BMD) were also assessed at week 26.

   RESULTS: At week 26, the placebo-adjusted least-squares mean change from baseline HbA1c (8.1%) was -0.7% and -0.9% for ertugliflozin 5 and 15 mg, respectively (both P < .001), to final means of 7.3% and 7.2%, respectively. The odds of HbA1c <7.0% were significantly greater in both ertugliflozin groups vs placebo. Ertugliflozin significantly reduced FPG, body weight, SBP and DBP vs placebo. The incidence of genital mycotic infections was higher in the ertugliflozin groups (female subjects: placebo, 0.9%; ertugliflozin 5 mg, 5.5%; ertugliflozin 15 mg, 6.3% [P = .032]; male subjects: 0%; 3.1%; 3.2%, respectively), as was the incidence of urinary tract infections and symptomatic hypoglycaemia. The incidence of hypovolaemia AEs was similar across groups. Ertugliflozin had no adverse impact on BMD at week 26.

   CONCLUSIONS: Ertugliflozin added to metformin in patients with inadequately controlled T2DM improved glycaemic control, reduced body weight and BP, but increased the incidence of genital mycotic infections. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Abstract
  Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, linagliptin, in subjects aged 60 years or older with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Methods: Data from eight 24-week, multinational, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group studies were analyzed. Patients aged 60 years or older with T2DM were received oral linagliptin (5 mg/d) or placebo in combination with metformin, or metformin plus sulfonylurea. Efficacy was assessed by the changes in glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) from baseline to 24 weeks of treatment. Safety endpoint included the frequency and intensity of adverse events. Results: A total of 1 421 patients (placebo 429, linagliptin 992) were included in the full analysis set (FAS). Mean ages of the subjects were (67.4+/-5.6) years in the linagliptin group and (66.7+/-5.6) years in the placebo group. Baseline HbA1c was (8.0+/-0.8) % in the linagliptin group and (8.1+/-0.9) % in the placebo group. At the end of 24-week, placebo-adjusted reduction in HbA1c in subjects with linagliptin was (0.7+/-0.1)% (95%CI 0.6-0.8, P<0.000 1), and placebo-adjusted reduction in FPG in subjects with linagliptin was (0.88+/-0.12) mmol/L(95%CI 0.65-1.11, P<0.000 1). Overall safety and tolerability in the two groups were similar. Adverse events occurred in 57.1% of patients in the placebo group and 61.1% of patients in the linagliptin group, and the incidence of adverse events leading to discontinuation was 3.2% in the placebo group and 3.8% in the linagliptin group. Serious adverse events occurred in 1.6% of patients in the placebo group and 2.8% of patients in the linagliptin group. Investigator-defined hypoglycaemia occurred in 7.3% of patients in the placebo group and 11.9% of patients in the linagliptin group. Among them, most were mild or moderate hypoglycaemia, and severe hypoglycaemia only occurred in 0.2% of patients in the placebo and 0.5% in the linagliptin groups. Overall incidence of hypoglycaemia in linagliptin group was slightly higher than that in placebo group, which might be due to the fact that more patients were taking sulfonylureas in linagliptin group than in placebo group (26.8% linagliptin; 18.4% placebo). No difference could be viewed in hypoglycaemia between the two groups in patients without sulfonylureas (1.2% linagliptin, 1.1% placebo). Moreover, no severe hypoglycaemia was reported in subjects without sulfonylureas. The incidences of other adverse events were similar in both groups. Conclusion:  Linagliptin was efficacious in lowering glucose with a safety profile similar to placebo in type 2 diabetic patients aged 60 years or older.

Abstract
  The present study aims to identify predictors for response to combination therapy with pioglitazone plus exenatide vs basal/bolus insulin therapy in T2DM patients who are poorly controlled with maximum/near-maximum doses of metformin plus a sulfonylurea. Participants in the Qatar study received a 75-g OGTT with measurement of plasma glucose, insulin and C-peptide concentration at baseline and were then randomized to receive either treatment with pioglitazone plus exenatide or basal/bolus insulin therapy for one year. Insulin secretion measured with plasma C-peptide concentration during the OGTT was the strongest predictor of response to combination therapy (HbA1c <= 7.0%) with pioglitazone plus exenatide. A 54% increase in 2-hour plasma C-peptide concentration above the fasting level identified subjects who achieved the glycaemic goal (HbA1c < 7.0%) with 82% sensitivity and 79% specificity. Only baseline HbA1c was a predictor of response to basal/bolus insulin therapy. Thus, the increment in 2-hour plasma C-peptide concentration above the fasting level provides a useful tool to identify poorly controlled T2DM patients who can achieve glycaemic control without insulin therapy, and thereby, can be used to individualize antihyperglycaemic therapy in poorly controlled T2DM patients.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: This prospective single-center study recruited insulin-resistant continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) therapy-naive patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) using insulin analog-based multiple daily injections (MDI) therapy and metformin.

   METHODS: A total of 23 individuals with T2D (70% male), aged a mean +/- standard deviation 57.2 +/- 8.03 years, with body mass index of 36.2 +/- 7.02 kg/m2, diabetes duration of 13.3 +/- 4.64 years, and HbA1c of 10.0% +/- 1.05% were randomly assigned to a CSII arm or an MDI continuation arm to explore glucose control, weight loss, total daily insulin dose (TDD), and insulin resistance. Insulin dosing was optimized over a 2-month run-in period.

   RESULTS: At 6 months, patients assigned to the CSII arm achieved a significant mean HbA1c reduction of -0.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] = -1.6, -0.1), while reducing their TDD by -29.8 +/- 28.41 U/day (33% of baseline [92.1 +/- 20.35 U/day]) and achieving body mass (BM) reduction of -0.8 +/- 5.61 kg (0.98% of baseline [104.8 +/- 16.15 kg]). MDI patients demonstrated a nonsignificant HbA1c reduction of -0.3% (95% CI = -0.8, 0.1) with a TDD reduction of 5% from baseline (99.0 +/- 25.25 U/day to 94.3 +/- 21.25 U/day), and a BM reduction of -1.0 +/- 2.03 kg (0.99% of baseline [108.9 +/- 20.55 kg]). After 6 months, the MDI arm crossed over to CSII therapy. At 12 months, patients continuing CSII demonstrated an additional mean 0.7% HbA1c reduction with 54.6% achieving HbA1c<8%. The final TDD reduction was -9.7 U/day in comparison to baseline; BM increased by 1.1 +/- 6.5 kg from baseline. The MDI patients that crossed to CSII showed an HbA1c reduction of -0.5% +/- 1.04%, HbA1c response rate of 27.3%, a TDD reduction of -17.4 +/- 21.06 U/day, and a BM reduction of -0.3 +/- 3.39 kg. Diabetic ketoacidosis or severe hypoglycemia did not occur in either arm.

   CONCLUSION: CSII therapy safely and significantly improved metabolic control with less insulin usage, with no sustainable reduction of BM, blood pressure, and lipid profile, in insulin-resistant T2D patients. Treatment adherence and satisfaction in these patients were excellent.

Abstract
  Metformin, a biguanide derivate, is known as the first-line antidiabetic agent for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) treatment. It reduces insulin resistance and decreases blood glucose concentration by inhibiting gluconeogenesis and suppressing hepatic glucose production with improved peripheral tissue insulin sensitivity. As an insulin sensitizer, metformin takes pleiotropic actions and exerts protective effects on multiple organs mainly in insulin-targeted tissues such as liver, muscle, and adipose tissues. Recent studies discover that metformin also plays essential roles in heart and pancreatic beta cells - two important organs in metabolic regulation. Metformin not only protects T2DM patients from cardiovascular diseases and heart failure, but also restores insulin secretion activities and protects pancreatic beta cells from lipotoxicity or glucotoxicity. Although accumulated evidence shed light on the metformin action, the precise mechanism of metformin is still under investigation. Further laboratory investigations and clinical trials are needed to pinpoint a map of metformin action. Based on recent findings, this review characterizes the beneficial role of metformin in cardiovascular diseases and pancreatic beta cells. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  Diabetes mellitus (DM) is frequently increased in many countries and become a serious health problem worldwide. Diabetes is associated with dysfunction of different organs such as heart, eyes, blood vessels, nerves, and kidneys. There is a strong connection between diabetes and cancer. Metformin is one of the most commonly prescribed oral antidiabetic medicines and it is suggested as the first-line therapy due to its comparatively safe, inexpensive, effective and well-tolerated. Some of the in vitro and in vivo investigations proved that metformin may have a direct anticancer action by preventing the proliferation of malignant cells and formations of the colony, inducing arrest of cell cycle and apoptosis and suppressing tumor growth. The antiproliferative mechanism of metformin alone or in combination with various chemotherapeutic agents is complex and involves several beneficial roles. In this regard, clinical studies are required to explain these roles. In the coming future, the use of metformin, alone or in combination with current chemotherapy, might be a conventional approach to effectually manage lung cancer. This mini-review provides a critical overview of currently available clinical trials investigating the effects of metformin in lung cancer.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the colorectal cancer (CRC) prevention effect of metformin in comparison with that of other T2DM medications from a Markov model perspective.

   METHODS: Literature concerning CRC morbidity of T2DM patients with metformin or other diabetes medications treatment was reviewed in PubMed and Cochrane Library database from September 2010 to December 2016.

   INCLUSION CRITERIA: (1)enrolled population was adult patients with T2DM but without CRC; (2) any of the parameters applied in our model was reported; (3) randomized clinical trials (RCTs), quasi-randomized trials, prospective or retrospective cohort studies. With CRC morbidity as endpoint, parameters were extracted to construct Markov model to assess CRC morbidity and cumulative tumor-free survival in each group over 11 years' follow-up period. Finally, Monte Carlo analysis was performed to evaluate the influence of parameter instability on the model.

   RESULTS: Seven literatures were recruited and 10 000 patients were virtually allocated for each arm. In contrast with non-metformin group, T2DM patients treated with metformin had a lower rate of CRC(1.670% vs. 2.146%, P=0.016). Moreover, cumulative tumor-free survival of metformin group was, slightly but significantly, better than that of non-metformin group (10.908 years vs. 10.882 years, P=0.000).

   CONCLUSIONS: T2DM patients treated with metformin have a lower morbidity of CRC and a better cumulative tumor-free survival than those of non-metformin group. Large scale RCTs are needed to illustrate the role of metformin in the prevention of CRC.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND AND AIM: Recently, there has been an increasing interest in the influence of antioxidant vitamins on the efficacy of oral hypoglycemic therapy in type 2 diabetic patients (T2DM). This single-blinded randomized controlled clinical trial aimed to investigate the effect of vitamin C and/or E supplementation on the efficacy of oral hypoglycemic therapy in T2DM Palestinian male patients from the Gaza Strip.

   METHODS: Forty T2DM male patients aged 40-60 years on metformin treatment were randomly divided into four groups, each group received an additional one of the following daily oral supplements for 90days: placebo; vitamin C; vitamin E and vitamin C plus vitamin E. After overnight fasting, venous blood specimens were collected from all individuals into K3-EDTA tubes and serum tubes for measuring the biochemical and hematological parameters of the study at baseline and after 90days of vitamins supplementation.

   RESULTS: The results revealed that vitamin C and/or E improve fasting blood sugar (FBS), HbA1c, lipid profile, insulin, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), reduced glutathione (GSH); and Quantitative Insulin Sensitivity Check Index (QISCI) compared with diabetic patients group that received placebo.

   CONCLUSION: This study provided additional evidence on the beneficial effects of supplementing antioxidant vitamins in T2DM which could improve the clinical condition and attenuate or prevent diabetic pathogenesis and complications that, secondly to poor glycemic control, could attribute to the imbalance between the decline in the endogenous antioxidants and increasing production of the reactive oxygen species leading to the oxidant-mediated damage present in the diabetic context.

Abstract
  AIMS: To evaluate the glucose variability, oxidative stress, metabolic and cardiovascular responses after an aerobic exercise session in diabetic patients on treatment with metformin plus vildagliptin or glibenclamide.

   METHODS: Parallel clinical trial including patients with type 2 diabetes treated with metformin plus vildagliptin or glibenclamide for 12weeks. Glucose variability, oxidative stress, metabolic (plasma glucose, insulin and glucagon-like-peptide-1) and cardiovascular responses were evaluated at rest, during and after a 30min aerobic exercise session (70% of the peak heart rate).

   RESULTS: Thirteen patients were included, seven in vildagliptin group (METV) and six in glibenclamide group (METG), baseline glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) 8.8+/-0.3%. Treatment reduced HbA1c (1.2% and 1.5% for METV and METG, respectively). The aerobic exercise session did not change glucose variability in both groups. A decrease in glucose during exercise recovery was found, with area under the curve lower in the METG vs. METV (p=0.04). After the intervention, systolic blood pressure (SBP) decreased in both groups. Patients treated with vildagliptin showed lower SBP variability compared to those treated with glibenclamide.

   CONCLUSIONS: Besides improvement in glucose control and reduction of SBP obtained by both treatments, lower blood pressure variability was observed in patients receiving vildagliptin. Glucose variability remained unaffected by both interventions and the exercise session. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  Metformin use in pregnancy is increasing worldwide as randomised controlled trial (RCT) evidence is emerging demonstrating its safety and efficacy. The Metformin in Gestational Diabetes (MiG) RCT changed practice in many countries demonstrating that metformin had similar pregnancy outcomes to insulin therapy with less maternal weight gain and a high degree of patient acceptability. A multicentre RCT is currently assessing the addition of metformin to insulin in pregnant women with type 2 diabetes. RCT evidence is also available for the use of metformin in pregnancy for women with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome and for nondiabetic women with obesity. No evidence of an increase in congenital malformations or miscarriages has been observed even when metformin is started before pregnancy and continued to term. Body composition and metabolic outcomes at two, seven, and nine years have now been reported for the offspring of mothers treated in the MiG study. In this review, we will briefly discuss the action of metformin and then consider the evidence from the key clinical trials.

Abstract
  Metformin is a lipophilic biguanide which inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis and improves peripheral utilization of glucose. It is the first line pharmacotherapy for glucose control in patients with Type 2 diabetes due to its safety, efficacy and tolerability. Metformin exhibits pleotropic effects, which may have beneficial effects on a variety of tissues independent of glucose control. A potential anti-tumourigenic effect of metformin may be mediated by its role in activating AMP-kinase, which in turn inhibits mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Non-AMPK dependent protective pathways may include reduction of insulin, insulin-like growth factor-1, leptin, inflammatory pathways and potentiation of adiponectin, all of which may have a role in tumourigenesis. A role in inhibiting cancer stem cells is also postulated. A number of large scale observational and cohort studies suggest metformin is associated with a reduced risk of a number of cancers, although the data is not conclusive. Recent randomised studies reporting use of metformin in treatment of cancer have revealed mixed results, and the results of much larger randomised trials of metformin as an adjuvant therapy in breast and colorectal cancers are awaited.

Abstract
  Diabetes and cancer are worldwide chronic diseases with a major impact on the quality and expectancy of life. Metabolic abnormalities observed during the onset and progression of diabetes may have a critical role on the initiation and progression of carcinogenesis. To date, there are no conclusive data on the mechanisms underlying the relationship between diabetes and any type of human cancer. However, recent evidence suggests that both hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia in diabetes could elicit cell damage responses, such as glucotoxicity, lipotoxicity and oxidative stress, which participate in the cell transformation process raising the risk of cancer development. In addition, clinical trials have revealed that several anti-diabetes therapies may potentially affect the risk of cancer though largely undefined mechanisms. In this review, we highlight epidemiological and pathophysiological aspects of diabetes, which may influence cancer initiation and progression. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  AIMS/INTRODUCTION: The aim of the present post-hoc analysis was to investigate the safety and efficacy of liraglutide in combination with one oral antidiabetic drug (OAD) across different OAD classes.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a post-hoc analysis using data from a 52-week, open-label, parallel-group trial, in which patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with a single OAD (alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, glinide, metformin or thiazolidinedione) were randomized to either pretrial OAD in combination with liraglutide 0.9 mg/day (liraglutide group) or pretrial OAD in combination with an additional OAD (additional OAD group). The primary outcome investigated in this post-hoc analysis was the incidence of adverse events.

   RESULTS: The proportions of patients experiencing adverse events across the different groups of pretrial OADs were comparable between liraglutide and additional OAD (alpha-glucosidase inhibitor 74.6 vs 70.0%; glinide 93.1 vs 87.1%; metformin 91.8 vs 87.1%; thiazolidinedione 86.2 vs 96.4%, respectively). Minor hypoglycemia was infrequent (seven episodes in two patients randomized to liraglutide, and two episodes in two patients randomized to additional OAD). The mean reduction in glycated hemoglobin appeared greater with liraglutide therapy, with the estimated mean treatment difference (95% confidence interval [CI]) for liraglutide vs additional OAD ranging from -0.14%, 95% CI: -0.48 to 0.21 (-1.5 mmol/mol, 95 CI: -5.2 to 2.3) to -0.44%, 95% CI:-0.79 to -0.09 (-4.8 mmol/mol, 95% CI: -8.6 to -1.0).

   CONCLUSIONS: The present analysis suggests that Japanese patients on OAD monotherapy might benefit from a greater improvement in glycemic control, without impacting tolerability, by combining their OAD with liraglutide rather than another OAD, regardless of which OAD monotherapy they are receiving.

Abstract
  Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the major cause of morbidity and mortality for individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D). In particular, the risk for stroke is twice that of patients without diabetes, and diabetes may be responsible for >8% of first ischemic strokes. Therefore, the way to prevent stroke in these patients has become an important issue. Traditionally, glucose-lowering drugs had not been shown to protect against stroke. Moreover, several antidiabetic drugs (i.e., sulfonylureas, rosiglitazone) have been reported to be associated with increased risks of CVD and stroke. On the contrary, data on the CV risks and benefits associated with new antidiabetic treatment in patients with T2D are emerging - and look promising. Therefore, it could be of great value to find out if any type of these new antidiabetic agents has protective effect against stroke. We review the available evidence regarding the risk of stroke in individuals taking non-insulin antidiabetic agents. To date, several antidiabetic agents have shown to have a positive effect on stroke prevention. The accumulated evidence suggests that metformin, pioglitazone and semaglutide reduce stroke risk. These agents do not represent only a way of controlling blood glucose and but also offer the opportunity to reduce stroke risk. Surely, new data from ongoing and future studies will provide additional information to select the best treatment for decreasing stroke risk in T2D patients.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND/AIMS: Many adolescents with type 2 diabetes (T2D) have rapid deterioration of glycemic control on metformin monotherapy within 2 years of diagnosis.

   METHODS: Enrollment data from the Pediatric Diabetes Consortium T2D Registry were used to categorize 276 youth with a T2D duration >=2 years into two groups: (1) participants with HbA1c <7.5% on metformin monotherapy (group 1, n = 75) and (2) participants treated with insulin +/- metformin (group 2, n = 201). The characteristics of the groups were compared.

   RESULTS: At enrollment, groups 1 and 2 did not differ in age (16.2 vs. 16.8 years) or BMI percentile (99 vs. 98%); group 2 had higher HbA1c (9.9% [85 mmol/mol] vs. 5.9% [41 mmol/mol], p < 0.001). Lower HbA1c and metformin monotherapy at diagnosis were associated with a greater likelihood of adequate control with metformin alone (p < 0.001). In multivariable analysis, HbA1c at diagnosis (p = 0.001) and diabetes duration (p = 0.009) were associated with adequate control on metformin. The HbA1c trajectory after diagnosis was worse in group 2.

   CONCLUSION: Durable metabolic control of T2D with metformin monotherapy is most likely in youth presenting with lower HbA1c and with shorter diabetes duration, independent of age, race-ethnicity, and BMI. Elevated HbA1c levels in those on insulin therapy highlight the importance of early diagnosis and a better understanding of glycemic control barriers. Copyright © 2017 S. Karger AG, Basel.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: The choice of therapy for type 2 diabetes after metformin is guided by overall estimates of glycemic response and side effects seen in large cohorts. A stratified approach to therapy would aim to improve on this by identifying subgroups of patients whose glycemic response or risk of side effects differs markedly. We assessed whether simple clinical characteristics could identify patients with differing glycemic response and side effects with sulfonylureas and thiazolidinediones.

   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied 22,379 patients starting sulfonylurea or thiazolidinedione therapy in the U.K. Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) to identify features associated with increased 1-year HbA1c fall with one therapy class and reduced fall with the second. We then assessed whether prespecified patient subgroups defined by the differential clinical factors showed differing 5-year glycemic response and side effects with sulfonylureas and thiazolidinediones using individual randomized trial data from ADOPT (A Diabetes Outcome Progression Trial) (first-line therapy, n = 2,725) and RECORD (Rosiglitazone Evaluated for Cardiovascular Outcomes and Regulation of Glycemia in Diabetes) (second-line therapy, n = 2,222). Further replication was conducted using routine clinical data from GoDARTS (Genetics of Diabetes Audit and Research in Tayside Scotland) (n = 1,977).

   RESULTS: In CPRD, male sex and lower BMI were associated with greater glycemic response with sulfonylureas and a lesser response with thiazolidinediones (both P < 0.001). In ADOPT and RECORD, nonobese males had a greater overall HbA1c reduction with sulfonylureas than with thiazolidinediones (P < 0.001); in contrast, obese females had a greater HbA1c reduction with thiazolidinediones than with sulfonylureas (P < 0.001). Weight gain and edema risk with thiazolidinediones were greatest in obese females; however, hypoglycemia risk with sulfonylureas was similar across all subgroups.

   CONCLUSIONS: Patient subgroups defined by sex and BMI have different patterns of benefits and risks on thiazolidinedione and sulfonylurea therapy. Subgroup-specific estimates can inform discussion about the choice of therapy after metformin for an individual patient. Our approach using routine and shared trial data provides a framework for future stratification research in type 2 diabetes. Copyright © 2018 by the American Diabetes Association.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy and safety of once-daily semaglutide in comparison with once-daily liraglutide and placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes.

   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This 26-week, multicenter, double-blind trial involved patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes with HbA1c 7.0-10.0% (53-86 mmol/mol) and treated with diet and exercise with or without metformin. Patients were randomized 2:2:1 to once-daily semaglutide, liraglutide, or placebo in one of four volume-matched doses (semaglutide 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, or 0.3 mg and liraglutide 0.3, 0.6, 1.2, or 1.8 mg, with both compared within each volume-matched dose group). Primary end point was change in HbA1c from baseline to week 26.

   RESULTS: In total, 705 randomized patients were exposed to trial products. At week 26, a dose-dependent change in HbA1c was observed with semaglutide from -1.1% (0.05 mg) to -1.9% (0.3 mg) and with liraglutide from -0.5% (0.3 mg) to -1.3% (1.8 mg) (all P < 0.001 in favor of volume-matched semaglutide dose). Change with pooled placebo was -0.02% (P < 0.0001 vs. semaglutide). Gastrointestinal (GI) disorders were the most common adverse events (AEs) with semaglutide and liraglutide, occurring in 32.8-54.0% and 21.9-41.5% of patients, respectively.

   CONCLUSIONS: Once-daily semaglutide at doses up to 0.3 mg/day resulted in greater reductions in HbA1c compared with liraglutide or placebo but with a higher frequency of GI AEs. Copyright © 2018 by the American Diabetes Association.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Metformin was found to reduce circulating levels of pituitary hormones.

   OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess whether sex determines the effect of metformin on lactotroph secretory function.

   METHODS: The study population included 25 women and 12 men with mildly elevated serum prolactin levels (25-75 ng/mL). Because of concomitant type 2 diabetes, all participants were treated with metformin (3 g daily). Plasma levels of glucose and lipids, HOMA1-IR, serum levels of prolactin, thyrotropin and free thyroid hormones, as well as Jostel's, SPINA-GT and SPINA-GD indices were assessed at baseline and at the end of metformin treatment.

   RESULTS: The study completed 24 women and 11 men. At baseline, there were no significant differences in circulating levels of glucose and lipids, insulin sensitivity, hormones, Jostel's, SPINA-GT and SPINA-GD indices between women and men. In both men and women, metformin reduced fasting glucose levels and HOMA1-IR. However, only in women metformin decreased elevated prolactin levels and this effect correlated with an improvement insulin sensitivity, as well as with the impact on SPINA-GT.

   CONCLUSIONS: The results of the study suggest that the effect of metformin on serum prolactin levels is sex-dependent. Copyright © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart . New York.

Abstract
  Recent studies have demonstrated that stromal derived factor-1alpha (SDF-1alpha) is a substrate of dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors. It has also been shown that SDF-1alpha shares anti-apoptotic as well as nephroprotective properties and exerts a beneficial effect in the cardiovascular system. Therefore, the aim of this study was to estimate the effect of treatment with the DDP-4 inhibitor sitagliptin on SDF-1alpha levels in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). Overall, 32 patients (16 males) with T2D, mean age (+/-SD) 67.2+/-8.3 years, HbA1c 6.4+/-0.5%, body-mass index (BMI) 29.1+/-4.9 Kg/m2, T2D duration 8.5+/-4.0 years receiving metformin monotherapy (17 participants) or metformin plus sitagliptin (15 participants) without known cardiovascular disease were enrolled. Patients on metformin plus sitagliptin exhibited higher plasma levels of SDF-1alpha compared with those on metformin monotherapy (19.6+/-4.1 versus 6.9+/-1.3 pg/ml, respectively, p=0.01). Multivariate regression analysis after controlling for age, sex, body-mass index, smoking, arterial hypertension, dyslipidaemia and other confounders showed that SDF-1alpha levels were positively correlated with DPP-4 inhibitor treatment (beta=0.91, p=0.001), and negatively with T2D duration (beta=- 0.42, p=0.05), EtaDL-cholesterol levels (beta=- 0.46, p=0.02) and HbA1c (beta=- 0.41, p=0.05). In conclusion, these results suggest that sitagliptin treatment may exert a favourable effect on SDF-1alpha levels. Copyright © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart . New York.

Abstract
  There are limited studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of treatments in young people with type 2 diabetes (T2D). This study compared the efficacy and safety of insulin detemir versus neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin, both in combination with metformin and lifestyle intervention, in children and adolescents with T2D. This randomized, open-label, phase 3 trial recruited patients (n = 42) aged 10-17 years diagnosed with T2D already receiving metformin +/- other oral antidiabetic drugs +/- basal insulin. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive either insulin detemir or NPH insulin, both with the maximum tolerated dose of metformin, and lifestyle intervention, over 26 weeks. Enrollment terminated prematurely after 17 months due to a very slow recruitment rate (12% of the target met). After 26 weeks, the observed mean HbA1c value had decreased by 0.61% points in the insulin detemir group vs. 0.84% points in the NPH insulin group. The rate of symptomatic blood glucose-confirmed hypoglycemic episodes was 0.4 episodes/patient-year of exposure (PYE) for insulin detemir vs. 1.1 episodes/PYE for NPH insulin.

   CONCLUSION: No safety issues were revealed with either basal insulin. Due to the low number of patients recruited, no efficacy conclusions could be drawn. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02131272. What is known: * There is a growing worldwide epidemic of type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents. * There is a lack of research and limited treatment options currently available in this population. What is new: * No safety issues with insulin detemir or neutral protamine Hagedorn insulin in children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes were observed. * Improving clinical trial recruitment, along with providing early, efficacious, and safe treatment options, in this population is critical.

Abstract
  This study aims to compare the effect of repaglinide and metformin among Chinese patients with newly diagnosed diabetes, and explore the possible mechanisms by which repaglinide alters insulin secretion.Sixty subjects with glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) < 10.0% were randomly selected to receive repaglinide or metformin monotherapy for 15 weeks. Blood glucose levels, glycemic variability, beta-cell function, and first-phase insulin secretion were compared between these 2 groups at baseline and at 15 weeks. Mouse insulinoma (MIN-6) cells were divided into 3 groups: low glucose, high glucose, and repaglinide 50 nm groups. Cells and cell culture mediums were collected at different timepoints. The expression of pericentrin (PCNT), F-actin, and insulin were tested with immunofluorescence and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.All glycemic parameters and variability indexes significantly decreased from baseline to 15 weeks, while no significant difference was found between these 2 groups at baseline or at 15 weeks. Furthermore, there was no significant difference found in fasting insulin and postprandial insulin at baseline and at 15 weeks, while homeostasis model assessment beta significantly increased. The first-phase glucose and insulin secretion of the intravenous glucose tolerance test improved in both groups, especially in the repaglinide group. Insulin, PCNT, and F-actin expression in MIN-6 cells decreased after 15 minutes of stimulation with repaglinide, while no difference was observed at 2, 6, and 12 hours. The insulin levels of the cell medium in the repaglinide group remained significantly higher at all timepoints. This study manifests that repaglinide has a noninferiority effect on the glycemic parameters of Chinese patients with newly diagnosed diabetes, when compared with metformin. The PCNT-F-actin pathway plays an important role in the repaglinide regulation process of on-demand insulin secretion.

Abstract
  AIMS: Our aim was to compare Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i) to Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4i) as add-on therapy to metformin.

   METHODS: We searched for randomized trials comparing SGLT-2i to DPP-4i as add-on therapy to metformin in Type 2 diabetes. We pooled trials reporting outcomes between 12 and 26 weeks together while trials reporting results >=52 weeks were pooled together. The primary outcomes were the change in haemoglobin A1c (A1c) at <=26 and >=52 weeks. Sensitivity analyses were performed according to the dose of SGLT-2i and according to baseline A1c for the primary outcomes.

   RESULTS: Seven trials met our inclusion criteria. There was a statistically significant reduction in A1c at >=52 weeks favouring SGLT-2i compared to DPP-4i (MD [95% CI]=-0.11% [-0.20, -0.03]) but no significant difference at <=26 weeks (MD [95% CI]=-0.05% [-0.16, 0.05]). SGLT-2i caused significantly more weight loss compared to DPP-4i at <=26 weeks and >=52 weeks (MD [95% CI]=-2.31kg [-2.66, -1.96] and -2.45kg [-2.83, -2.07], respectively). SGLT-2i treated patients had a significantly more genital infection compared to DPP-4i. On restricting the analysis according to the SGLT-2i FDA-approved dose, only higher doses at >=52 weeks showed a statistically significant reduction in A1c compared to DPP-4i. On restricting the analysis according to baseline A1c, results favoured DPP-4i if baseline A1c was<8.5%, but favoured SGLT-2i if >=8.5%.

   CONCLUSION: While both SGLT-2i and DPP-4i can reduce A1c, SGLT-2i causes a more robust A1c reduction and more weight loss but with more genital infections. Higher doses of SGLT-2i showed more efficacy when compared to DPP-4i; however, this data should be interpreted cautiously given the limited number of trials. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: Pediatric type 2 diabetes prevalence is increasing, with beta-cell dysfunction key in its pathogenesis. The RISE Pediatric Medication Study compared two approaches-glargine followed by metformin and metformin alone-in preserving or improving beta-cell function in youth with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes during and after therapy withdrawal.

   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Ninety-one pubertal, overweight/obese 10-19-year-old youth with IGT (60%) or type 2 diabetes of <6 months duration (40%) were randomized to either 3 months of insulin glargine with a target glucose of 4.4-5.0 mmol/L followed by 9 months of metformin or to 12 months of metformin alone. beta-Cell function (insulin sensitivity paired with beta-cell responses) was assessed by hyperglycemic clamp at baseline, 12 months (on treatment), and 15 months (3 months off treatment).

   RESULTS: No significant differences were observed between treatment groups at baseline, 12 months, or 15 months in beta-cell function, BMI percentile, HbA1c, fasting glucose, or oral glucose tolerance test 2-h glucose results. In both treatment groups, clamp-measured beta-cell function was significantly lower at 12 and 15 months versus baseline. HbA1c fell transiently at 6 months within both groups. BMI was higher in the glargine followed by metformin versus metformin alone group between 3 and 9 months. Only 5% of participants discontinued the interventions, and both treatments were well tolerated.

   CONCLUSIONS: In youth with IGT or recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes, neither 3 months of glargine followed by 9 months of metformin nor 12 months of metformin alone halted the progressive deterioration of beta-cell function. Alternate approaches to preserve beta-cell function in youth are needed. Copyright © 2018 by the American Diabetes Association.

Abstract
  We investigated the effect of sequential treatment escalation with dapagliflozin and saxagliptin on beta cell function in patients with T2DM insufficiently controlled on metformin monotherapy during a hyperglycaemic clamp investigation. Twenty-six patients (19 males, age 63.5+/-7.0 years; duration of diabetes 8.8+/-4.7 years; HbA1c 63.9+/-15.8 mmol/mol; mean+/-SD) were enrolled in the study. During a first treatment period (TP1) all patients received 10 mg dapagliflozin for one month, followed by the addition of 5 mg saxagliptin or placebo for another month (TP2). At baseline and at the end of each treatment period, fasting glucose and insulin levels were analysed, and a hyperglycaemic clamp with the measurement of plasma C-peptide, insulin, proinsulin, and glucagon was performed. Treatment with dapagliflozin reduced fasting glucose levels and insulin resistance (TP1). Within the hyperglycaemic clamp, C-peptide and insulin concentrations increased after the addition of dapagliflozin in TP1 (0.48+/-0.45 nmol*h/l; 6.24+/-17.9 mU*h/l) and further improved after the addition of saxagliptin in TP2 (0.38+/-0.34 nmol*h/l; 6.59+/-10.15 mU*h/l). Acute insulin response did not change after the addition of dapagliflozin (TP1), but significantly improved after the addition of saxagliptin in TP2 (0.89+/-0.76 mU*h/l). Both drugs improved the C-peptide/proinsulin ratio. After the addition of saxagliptin, the glucagon/insulin ratio significantly declined (TP2). Treatment escalation with dapagliflozin and saxagliptin exhibit additive effects on beta cell capacity, and improves alpha and beta cell integrity. Copyright © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart .

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Targeting biomarkers of oxidative-proinflammatory stress may result in improvement of modifiable metabolic syndrome, pre-diabetes and diabetes risk factors and subsequent risk reduction.

   METHODS: 64 newly diagnosed antihyperglycemic treatment-naive prediabetic and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients were randomly assigned using block design to either metformin combined with therapeutic lifestyle changes (TLC) or TLC alone. Body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting lipid profile, plasma oxidative status and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha were measured at baseline, after 3 months and after 6 months from baseline.

   RESULTS: Except for HbA1c, baseline values did not differ significantly between the two groups. The post 3-months relative reductions in BMI (P=0.014) and HbA1c (P=0.037) in metformin combined with TLC intervention were significantly greater than those in TLC alone group. TNFalpha plasma levels were decreased significantly vs. baseline by metformin combined with TLC intervention (-22.90+/-46.76%, P=0.01). Conversely, TLC alone basically worsened proinflammatory status (42.40+/-40.82 %), P<0.001. Metformin with TLC treatment effected a therapeutic decrement of the oxidative stress (-15.44+/-35.32%, P=0.029 vs. baseline) unlike TLC alone (61.49+/-122.66%, P=0.01 vs. baseline). Both interventions' effects were sustained in the 6-month follow up periods.

   CONCLUSION: In both intervention groups, the relative changes in plasma TNFalpha were significantly correlated (P<0.01) with systolic blood pressure and the relative changes in oxidative stress were markedly correlated (P<0.05) with total cholesterol.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: To study the effectiveness of exenatide with metformin and sequential treatment with exenatide and glargine added to metformin and their influence on insulin sensitivity and adipose distribution.

   METHODS: 20 newly diagnosed obese type 2 diabetic patients were enrolled, and 2-month washout treatment of metformin, 6-month exenatide treatment, and 6-month glargine treatment were administrated sequentially accompanied with previous metformin. Glucolipid metabolic parameters were compared among groups. Adipose distribution was quantified with computerized tomography according to anatomy, dividing into visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), adding up to total adipose tissue (TAT).

   RESULTS: The 6-month exenatide treatment dramatically ameliorated the glucose and lipid profile, improved insulin sensitivity, and mainly decreased VAT and also the ratio of VAT/SAT (RVS). The following 6-month glargine treatment increased VAT. The whole 12-month sequential treatment with exenatide and glargine added to metformin basically improved the insulin sensitivity and glucolipid control though VAT rebounded at the end, however without deteriorating the other parameters.

   CONCLUSION: Exenatide is an ideal treatment for obese type 2 diabetic patients in the aspect of adipose tissue distribution. Sequential treatment of exenatide and glargine could be an alternative for low-income patients who cannot afford GLP-1 agonist for long time. This trial is registered with ChiCTR-OOC-17013679.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: This study analyzed the efficacy of low-dose aspirin in cancer chemoprevention in patients with diabetes.

   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This study was a posttrial follow-up of the Japanese Primary Prevention of Atherosclerosis with Aspirin for Diabetes (JPAD) trial. Participants in the JPAD trial (2,536 Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes and without preexisting cardiovascular disease) were randomly allocated to receive aspirin (81 or 100 mg daily) or no aspirin. After that trial ended in 2008, we followed up with the participants until 2015, with no attempt to change the previously assigned therapy. The primary end point was total cancer incidence. We investigated the effect of low-dose aspirin on cancer incidence.

   RESULTS: During the median follow-up period of 10.7 years, a total of 318 cancers occurred. The cancer incidence was not significantly different between the aspirin and no-aspirin groups (log-rank, P = 0.4; hazard ratio [HR], 0.92; 95% CI, 0.73-1.14; P = 0.4). In subgroup analyses, aspirin did not affect cancer incidence in men, women, or participants aged >=65 years. However, it decreased cancer incidence in participants aged <65 years (log-rank, P = 0.05; HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.44-0.99; P = 0.048). After adjusting for sex, hemoglobin A1c, smoking status, and administration of metformin and statins, aspirin significantly reduced cancer incidence in participants aged <65 years (adjusted HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.43-0.99; P = 0.04).

   CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose aspirin did not reduce cancer incidence in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes. Copyright © 2018 by the American Diabetes Association.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of empagliflozin on bone fractures and bone mineral density in patients with type 2 diabetes in pooled placebo-controlled trial data and a head-to-head study versus glimepiride.

   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Pooled data were analyzed from patients who were randomized 1:1:1 to empagliflozin 10 mg, empagliflozin 25 mg, or placebo in phase I-III clinical trials. Data were also analyzed from the EMPA-REG H2H-SU trial in which patients received empagliflozin 25 mg or glimepiride as an add-on to metformin for 104 weeks with a 104-week extension. Bone fracture adverse events (AEs) were evaluated through a search of investigator-reported (nonadjudicated) events.

   RESULTS: In the pooled analysis, bone fracture AEs were reported in 119 of 4,221 (2.8%), 105 of 4,196 (2.5%), and 123 of 4,203 (2.9%) patients in the empagliflozin 10 mg, empagliflozin 25 mg, and placebo groups, respectively (rates of 1.55, 1.36, and 1.69/100 patient-years, respectively). In the EMPA-REG H2H-SU trial, bone fracture AEs were reported in 31 of 765 (4.1%) patients receiving empagliflozin 25 mg and in 33 of 780 (4.2%) patients receiving glimepiride (rates of 1.28 and 1.40/100 patient-years, respectively).

   CONCLUSIONS: Empagliflozin did not increase the risk of bone fracture compared with placebo in a pooled analysis of >12,000 patients or compared with glimepiride in a 4-year head-to-head study. Copyright © 2018 by the American Diabetes Association.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Impaired insulin activity in women with polycystic ovary syndrome might differ from that seen in type 2 diabetes mellitus without polycystic ovary syndrome. This study was designed to compare the effects of treatment with metformin, saxagliptin, and their combination in newly diagnosed women with type 2 diabetes mellitus and polycystic ovary syndrome in China.

   METHODS: A total of 75 newly diagnosed patients from Shanghai, China with type 2 diabetes mellitus and polycystic ovary syndrome were included in this randomized, parallel, open-label study. All patients received treatment for 24 weeks with metformin, saxagliptin, or their combination. Patients were allocated to one of three treatment groups by a computer-generated code that facilitated equal patient distribution of 25 patients per group. The primary outcome was a change in glycemic control and beta-cell function.

   RESULTS: A total of 63 patients completed the study (n = 21, for each group). The reduction in hemoglobin A1c was significant in the combination group, compared to the monotherapy groups (saxagliptin vs. combination treatment vs. metformin: - 1.1 vs. -1.3 vs. -1.1%, P = 0.016), whereas it was comparable between the metformin and saxagliptin groups (P > 0.05). Saxagliptin, metformin, and the combination treatment significantly reduced the homeostasis model assessment- insulin resistance index and increased the deposition index (P < 0.01 for all). However, no significant change was observed in the homeostasis model assessment- beta-cell function among the metformin and combination groups, and no significant changes were observed in the insulinogenic index among all three groups (P > 0.05 for all). In addition, saxagliptin and metformin treatments significantly reduced body mass index and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels (P < 0.01 for both).

   CONCLUSIONS: Saxagliptin and metformin were comparably effective in regulating weight loss, glycemic control, and beta-cell function, improving lipid profiles, and reducing inflammation in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with polycystic ovary syndrome.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Despite common mechanisms of actions, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists differ in structure, pharmacokinetic profile, and clinical effects. This head-to-head trial compared semaglutide with dulaglutide in patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes.

   METHODS: This was an open-label, parallel-group, phase 3b trial done at 194 hospitals, clinical institutions or private practices in 16 countries. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older and had type 2 diabetes with HbA1c 7.0-10.5% (53.0-91.0 mmol/mol) on metformin monotherapy. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) by use of an interactive web-response system to once a week treatment with either semaglutide 0.5 mg, dulaglutide 0.75 mg, semaglutide 1.0 mg, or dulaglutide 1.5 mg subcutaneously. The primary endpoint was change from baseline in percentage HbA1c; the confirmatory secondary endpoint was change in bodyweight, both at week 40. The primary analysis population included all randomly assigned patients exposed to at least one dose of trial product obtained while on treatment and before the onset of rescue medication. The safety population included all randomly assigned patients exposed to at least one dose of trial product obtained while on treatment. The trial was powered for HbA1c non-inferiority (margin 0.4%) and bodyweight superiority. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02648204.

   FINDINGS: Between Jan 6, 2016, and June 22, 2016, 1201 patients were randomly assigned to treatment; of these, 301 were exposed to semaglutide 0.5 mg, 299 to dulaglutide 0.75 mg, 300 to semaglutide 1.0 mg, and 299 to dulaglutide 1.5 mg. 72 (6%) patients withdrew from the trial (22 receiving semaglutide 0.5 mg, 13 receiving dulaglutide 0.75 mg, 21 receiving semaglutide 1.0 mg, and 16 receiving dulaglutide 1.5 mg). From overall baseline mean, mean percentage HbA1c was reduced by 1.5 (SE 0.06) percentage points with semaglutide 0.5 mg versus 1.1 (0.05) percentage points with dulaglutide 0.75 mg (estimated treatment difference [ETD] -0.40 percentage points [95% CI -0.55 to -0.25]; p<0.0001) and by 1.8 (0.06) percentage points with semaglutide 1.0 mg versus 1.4 (0.06) percentage points with dulaglutide 1.5 mg (ETD -0.41 percentage points [-0.57 to -0.25]; p<0.0001). From overall baseline mean, mean bodyweight was reduced by 4.6 kg (SE 0.28) with semaglutide 0.5 mg compared with 2.3 kg (0.27) with dulaglutide 0.75 mg (ETD -2.26 kg [-3.02 to -1.51]; p<0.0001) and by 6.5 kg (0.28) with semaglutide 1.0 mg compared with 3.0 kg (0.27) with dulaglutide 1.5 mg (ETD -3.55 kg [-4.32 to -2.78]; p<0.0001). Gastrointestinal disorders were the most frequently reported adverse event, occurring in 129 (43%) of 301 patients receiving semaglutide 0.5 mg, 133 (44%) of 300 patients receiving semaglutide 1.0 mg, 100 (33%) of 299 patients receiving dulaglutide 0.75 mg, and in 143 (48%) of 299 patients receiving dulaglutide 1.5 mg. Gastrointestinal disorders were also the most common reason for discontinuing treatment with semaglutide and dulaglutide. There were six fatalities: one in each semaglutide group and two in each dulaglutide group.

   INTERPRETATION: At low and high doses, semaglutide was superior to dulaglutide in improving glycaemic control and reducing bodyweight, enabling a significantly greater number of patients with type 2 diabetes to achieve clinically meaningful glycaemic targets and weight loss, with a similar safety profile.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: The combination of metformin and a sulphonylurea has been recommended for treatment of type 2 diabetes. A, scored, breakable, extended release, once daily fixed dose combination (FDC) of gliclazide and metformin is available in India.

   OBJECTIVE: To assess the initial blood glucose lowering efficacy, glycemic control and patient acceptability of the fixed dose combination of original gliclazide 60mg and metformin 500mg in an extended release, scored and breakable formulation (in a range of 1, 11/2, and 2 tablets) among Indian patients in day to day practice.

   METHODS: In a multi-center epidemiologic surveillance protocol of 60 days, patients with type 2 diabetes were prospectively prescribed 1 to 2 tablet of gliclazide 60mg + metformin 500mg during the course of study. The possibility of breaking the tablet in two equal halves enabled administration of 11/2 tablets wherever required. Primary data on fasting plasma glucose response and adverse events was extracted for analysis from the case records of patients kept with the investigators. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients achieving glycemic control, defined as fasting plasma glucose of 90-130 mg/dl at the end of the study.

   RESULTS: Of the 759 patients treated with an extended release FDC of gliclazide 60mg + metformin 500mg, the number (%, 95% CI) which achieved glycemic control was 474/759 (62.5%, 59.0% to 65.8%). The proportion controlled with 1 tablet was, 252/759 (33.2%, 29.9% to 36.6%); with 11/2 tablets, 149/298, (50.0%, 44.3% to 55.6%); and with 2 tablets, 73/94, (77.5%, 68.2% to 85.0%). Mean (95% CI) FPG mg/dl decreased from baseline by 48.7 (45.0 to 51.4) with 1 tablet; by 71.3 (66.0 to 76.6) with 11/2 tablets; and by 86.3 (75.7 to 96.9) with 2 tablets. Frequency of hypo-glycaemia was 0.7%.

   CONCLUSIONS: Extended release FDC of gliclazide 60mg + metformin 500mg, a scored, breakable, once daily, formulation was effective in controlling blood glucose in a large proportion of type 2 diabetes with a low risk of hypoglycaemia.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND AND AIM: The number of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is increasing. Most patients with T2DM are uncontrolled and fail to achieve their target Hba1c. In recent years, newer agents such as SGLT2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) have been approved for clinical use. Though data from clinical trials and sub set analysis of Indian patients in global studies are promising, real world evidence from standard clinical practice in India is lacking. The aim of this study was to analyze the metabolic parameters in patients with T2DM on SGLT2i in real world clinical practice.

   MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a prospective, longitudinal study of 100 patients with uncontrolled T2DM attending the outpatient of a specialized diabetes hospital. Their metabolic parameters were evaluated at baseline and after 3 months of follow up. They were categorized based on their baseline anti diabetic medications into four groups (25 in each). The groups were as follows: metformin plus sulfonylurea, metformin plus DPP4 inhibitor, triple drug regimen with metformin plus DPP4 inhibitor plus sulfonylurea, and patients on insulin and on triple drug therapy with metformin plus sulfonylurea plus DPP4 inhibitor. Patients in each group were initiated with an SGLT2i. Descriptive statistical analysis was carried out using Microsoft excel. T test was used to calculate the p value at 5 % level of significance.

   RESULTS: The mean age of the subjects in the study population was 53.20+/-12.1 years and the duration of diabetes was 13.1+/-7.26 years. The mean Hba1c reduction and weight reduction observed was 1.02+/-0.24% and 2.64+/-1.27 kg respectively. Genital pruritis was reported in 4% of the patients. There was a 16.6% reduction in the daily insulin requirement at follow up when compared to baseline. No other side effects were observed. The reductions in Hba1c and weight were statistically significant (p<0.05) across all groups.

   CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that when SGLT2i are added at any stage of the disease spectrum with any of the preexisting therapeutic agents for patients with uncontrolled T2DM, there is an improvement in glycemic control and body weight, with minimal side effects. The real world study data on Indian patients appears to be promising.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND AND AIM: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is one of the major diseases confronting the health care systems. In diabetes mellitus (DM), combined use of oral hypoglycemic medications has been shown to be more effective than metformin (Met) alone in glycemic control. This study determined the effects of Ginkgo biloba (GKB) extract as an adjuvant to Met in patients with uncontrolled T2DM.

   SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Sixty T2DM patients were recruited in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, and multicenter trial. The patients, currently using Met, were randomly grouped into those treated with either GKB extract (120 mg/day) or placebo (starch, 120 mg/day) for 90 days. Blood glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting serum glucose, serum insulin, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), insulin resistance, and visceral adiposity index (VAI) were determined before (baseline) and after 90 days of GKB extract treatment.

   RESULTS: GKB extract significantly decreased blood HbA1c (7.7%+/-1.2% vs baseline 8.6%+/-1.6%, P<0.001), fasting serum glucose (154.7+/-36.1 mg/dL vs baseline 194.4+/-66.1 mg/dL, P<0.001) and insulin (13.4+/-7.8 muU/mL vs baseline 18.5+/-8.9 muU/mL, P=0.006) levels, BMI (31.6+/-5.1 kg/m2 vs baseline 34.0+/-6.0 kg/m2, P<0.001), waist WC (102.6+/-10.5 cm vs baseline 106.0+/-10.9 cm, P<0.001), and VAI (158.9+/-67.2 vs baseline 192.0+/-86.2, P=0.007). GKB extract did not negatively impact the liver, kidney, or hematopoietic functions.

   CONCLUSION: GKB extract as an adjuvant was effective in improving Met treatment outcomes in T2DM patients. Thus, it is suggested that GKB extract is an effective dietary supplement for the control of DM in humans.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: The best treatment option for patients with type 2 diabetes in whom treatment with metformin alone fails to achieve adequate glycaemic control is debated. We aimed to compare the long-term effects of pioglitazone versus sulfonylureas, given in addition to metformin, on cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes.

   METHODS: TOSCA.IT was a multicentre, randomised, pragmatic clinical trial, in which patients aged 50-75 years with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin monotherapy (2-3 g per day) were recruited from 57 diabetes clinics in Italy. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1), by permuted blocks randomisation (block size 10), stratified by site and previous cardiovascular events, to add-on pioglitazone (15-45 mg) or a sulfonylurea (5-15 mg glibenclamide, 2-6 mg glimepiride, or 30-120 mg gliclazide, in accordance with local practice). The trial was unblinded, but event adjudicators were unaware of treatment assignment. The primary outcome, assessed with a Cox proportional-hazards model, was a composite of first occurrence of all-cause death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or urgent coronary revascularisation, assessed in the modified intention-to-treat population (all randomly assigned participants with baseline data available and without any protocol violations in relation to inclusion or exclusion criteria). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00700856.

   FINDINGS: Between Sept 18, 2008, and Jan 15, 2014, 3028 patients were randomly assigned and included in the analyses. 1535 were assigned to pioglitazone and 1493 to sulfonylureas (glibenclamide 24 [2%], glimepiride 723 [48%], gliclazide 745 [50%]). At baseline, 335 (11%) participants had a previous cardiovascular event. The study was stopped early on the basis of a futility analysis after a median follow-up of 57.3 months. The primary outcome occurred in 105 patients (1.5 per 100 person-years) who were given pioglitazone and 108 (1.5 per 100 person-years) who were given sulfonylureas (hazard ratio 0.96, 95% CI 0.74-1.26, p=0.79). Fewer patients had hypoglycaemias in the pioglitazone group than in the sulfonylureas group (148 [10%] vs 508 [34%], p<0.0001). Moderate weight gain (less than 2 kg, on average) occurred in both groups. Rates of heart failure, bladder cancer, and fractures were not significantly different between treatment groups.

   INTERPRETATION: In this long-term, pragmatic trial, incidence of cardiovascular events was similar with sulfonylureas (mostly glimepiride and gliclazide) and pioglitazone as add-on treatments to metformin. Both of these widely available and affordable treatments are suitable options with respect to efficacy and adverse events, although pioglitazone was associated with fewer hypoglycaemia events.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: In Japan, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors are frequently used as the treatment of choice for patients with type 2 diabetes. In some cases, however, poor glycaemic and body weight control issues persist despite treatment with DPP-4 inhibitors. Previous researchers have revealed that sodium-dependent glucose transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors reduce both plasma glucose levels and body weight in patients with type 2 diabetes. However, further investigation regarding the effects of SGLT-2 inhibitors on body composition, especially in the Asian population who tends to have relatively low-to-moderate body mass indices, is required. Therefore, we aim to determine the effects of treatment with SGLT-2 inhibitors or metformin for reducing visceral fat in 106 Asian patients with type 2 diabetes who were undergoing treatment with the DPP-4 inhibitor sitagliptin (50 mg daily) for poor glycaemic control.

   METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A prospective, multicentre, blinded-endpoint phase IV randomised controlled study will be conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a 24-week treatment with either an SGLT-2 inhibitor (ipragliflozin) or metformin for reducing visceral fat and plasma glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes. Patients who satisfy the eligibility criteria will be randomised (1:1) to receive ipragliflozin (50 mg daily) or metformin (1000 mg daily). The primary outcome is the rate of change in the total area of visceral fat for patients in both treatment groups, measured using CT, after 24 weeks of therapy. Two radiologists, blinded to the clinical information, will perform centralised analysis of the images in a unified measurement condition.

   ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The protocol was approved by the institutional review board of each hospital. This study is ongoing and due to finish in April 2017. The findings of this study will be disseminated via peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations, and will also be disseminated to participants.

Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: Clozapine, while effective in treatment refractory schizophrenia, is associated with significant weight gain, heart disease and increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Although there is evidence for weight loss with metformin for people with obesity who are already taking clozapine, there have been no published trials that have investigated the effect of metformin in attenuating weight gain at the time of clozapine initiation.

   METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A 24-week double-blind placebo-controlled trial of concomitant prescription of metformin at clozapine commencement. Eighty-six people being commenced on clozapine will be randomised to placebo or metformin (variable dose, up to 2 g/day). The primary outcome is comparative end point body weight, between the placebo and metformin groups. Secondary outcomes are comparative rates of conversion to T2DM, alteration of metabolic syndrome parameters, proportion gaining >5% body weight and changes in diet and appetite. We will additionally examine biomarkers associated with change in weight among trial participants.

   ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval was granted by the Metro South Human Research Ethics Committee HREC/17/QPAH/538-SSA/17/QPAH/565. We plan to submit a manuscript of the results to a peer-reviewed journal, and present results at conferences, consumer forums and hospital grand rounds.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) typically use several drug treatments during their lifetime. There is a debate about the best second-line therapy after metformin monotherapy failure due to the increasing number of available antidiabetic drugs and the lack of comparative clinical trials of secondary treatment regimens. While prior research compared the cost-effectiveness of two alternative drugs, the literature assessing T2D treatment pathways is scarce. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term cost-effectiveness of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4i) compared to sulfonylureas (SU) as second-line therapy in combination with metformin in patients with T2D.

   METHODS: A Markov model was developed with four health states, 1 year cycle, and a 25-year time horizon. Clinical and cost data were collected from previous studies and other readily available secondary data sources. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was estimated from the US third party payer perspective. Both, costs and outcomes, were discounted at a 3% annual discount rate. One way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the impact of uncertainty on the base-case results.

   RESULTS: The discounted incremental cost of metformin+DPP-4i compared to metformin+SU was $11,849 and the incremental life-years gained were 0.61, resulting in an ICER of $19,420 per life-year gained for patients in the metformin+DPP-4i treatment pathway. The ICER estimated in the probabilistic sensitivity analysis was $19,980 per life-year gained. Sensitivity analyses showed that the results of the study were not sensitive to changes in the parameters used in base-case.

   CONCLUSIONS: The metformin+DPP-4i treatment pathway was cost-effective compared to metformin+SU as a long-term second-line therapy in the treatment of T2D from the US health care payer perspective. Study findings have the potential to provide clinicians and third party payers valuable evidence for the prescription and utilization of cost-effective second-line therapy after metformin monotherapy failure in the treatment of T2D.

Abstract
  With the rising incidence and prevalence rates of type 2 diabetes globally, it is imperative that diabetes prevention strategies are implemented to stem the flow of new cases. Successful interventions include both lifestyle modification and pharmaceutical agents, and large, multicentre, randomised, controlled studies in different populations have identified the benefits of both. However, translating positive trial outcomes to the real world is particularly challenging, as lifestyle interventions require regular reinforcement from healthcare professionals to be maintained. Pharmaceutical therapies may therefore play an adjunctive role in combination with lifestyle to prevent diabetes. Population-based strategies are also necessary to reduce sedentary behaviour and obesity. Well-established glucose-lowering therapies such as metformin, sulphonylureas, thiazolidinediones and insulin and newer agents such as incretin therapies and sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors have all been investigated in randomised controlled trials for diabetes prevention with varying success. Non-glucose-lowering therapies such as orlistat and renin angiotensin system blockers can prevent diabetes, whereas statins are associated with slightly increased risk. Diabetes prevention strategies should carefully consider the use of these agents according to individual patient circumstances and phenotypic profile.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review of cost-effectiveness, cost-utility, and cost-benefit studies of DPP-4 inhibitors for diabetes treatment versus other antidiabetics.

   METHODS: Three investigators searched the CRD York, Tufts CEA Registry, and MEDLINE databases through 2015. We reviewed all potentially relevant titles and abstracts, and screened full-text articles, according to inclusion criteria. We established a quality score for each study based on a 35-item list.

   RESULTS: A total of 295 studies were identified, of which 20 were included. The average quality score was 0.720 on a 0-1 scale. All studies were performed in high- and middle-income countries, using a 3rd-party payer perspective and randomized clinical trials to measure effectiveness. Sitagliptin, saxagliptin and vildagliptin had an ICER below 25,000 /QALY, as second-line and as add-ons to metformin, in comparison to sulfonylureas. When compared with sitagliptin, liraglutide (GLP-1 receptor agonist) had an ICER of up to 22,724 /QALY for the 1.2-mg dosage, and up to 32,869 /QALY for the 1.8-mg dosage. Insulin glargine was dominant when compared with sitagliptin.

   CONCLUSIONS: According to the WHO threshold applied to the country and year of each study, DPP-4 inhibitors were highly cost-effective as second-line, as add-ons to metformin, in comparison with sulfonylureas. More recent therapies (GLP-1 receptor agonists and insulin glargine) were highly cost-effective in comparison to DPP-4 inhibitors. These results were obtained, however, on the basis of a limited number of studies, relying on the same few clinical trials, and financed by manufacturers. Further independent research is needed to confirm these findings.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: Few randomized controlled trials have focused on the optimal management of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) during the transition from the inpatient to outpatient setting. This multicenter open-label study explored a discharge strategy based on admission hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) to guide therapy in general medicine and surgery patients with T2D.

   METHODS: Patients with HbA1c <=7% (53 mmol/mol) were discharged on sitagliptin and metformin; patients with HbA1c between 7 and 9% (53-75 mmol/mol) and those >9% (75 mmol/mol) were discharged on sitagliptinmetformin with glargine U-100 at 50% or 80% of the hospital daily dose. The primary outcome was change in HbA1c at 3 and 6 months after discharge.

   RESULTS: Mean HbA1c on admission for the entire cohort (N = 253) was 8.70 +/- 2.3% and decreased to 7.30 +/- 1.5% and 7.30 +/- 1.7% at 3 and 6 months ( P<.001). Patients with HbA1c <7% went from 6.3 +/- 0.5% to 6.3 +/- 0.80% and 6.2 +/- 1.0% at 3 and 6 months. Patients with HbA1c between 7 and 9% had a reduction from 8.0 +/- 0.6% to 7.3 +/- 1.1% and 7.3 +/- 1.3%, and those with HbA1c >9% from 11.3 +/- 1.7% to 8.0 +/- 1.8% and 8.0 +/- 2.0% at 3 and 6 months after discharge (both P<.001). Clinically significant hypoglycemia (<54 mg/dL) was observed in 4%, 4%, and 7% among patients with a HbA1c <7%, 7 to 9%, and >9%, while a glucose <40 mg/dL was reported in <1% in all groups.

   CONCLUSION: The proposed HbA1c-based hospital discharge algorithm using a combination of sitagliptin-metformin was safe and significantly improved glycemic control after hospital discharge in general medicine and surgery patients with T2D.

Abstract
  In type 2 diabetes (T2D), hepatic insulin resistance is strongly associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In this study, we hypothesized that the DNA methylome of livers from patients with T2D compared with livers of individuals with normal plasma glucose levels can unveil some mechanism of hepatic insulin resistance that could link to NAFLD. Using DNA methylome and transcriptome analyses of livers from obese individuals, we found that hypomethylation at a CpG site in PDGFA (encoding platelet-derived growth factor alpha) and PDGFA overexpression are both associated with increased T2D risk, hyperinsulinemia, increased insulin resistance, and increased steatohepatitis risk. Genetic risk score studies and human cell modeling pointed to a causative effect of high insulin levels on PDGFA CpG site hypomethylation, PDGFA overexpression, and increased PDGF-AA secretion from the liver. We found that PDGF-AA secretion further stimulates its own expression through protein kinase C activity and contributes to insulin resistance through decreased expression of insulin receptor substrate 1 and of insulin receptor. Importantly, hepatocyte insulin sensitivity can be restored by PDGF-AA-blocking antibodies, PDGF receptor inhibitors, and by metformin, opening therapeutic avenues. Therefore, in the liver of obese patients with T2D, the increased PDGF-AA signaling contributes to insulin resistance, opening new therapeutic avenues against T2D and possibly NAFLD.

Abstract
  Metformin is the first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes (T2D). Although widely prescribed, the glucose-lowering mechanism for metformin is incompletely understood. Here, we used a genome-wide association approach in a diverse group of individuals with T2D from the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) clinical trial to identify common and rare variants associated with HbA1c response to metformin treatment and followed up these findings in four replication cohorts. Common variants in PRPF31 and CPA6 were associated with worse and better metformin response, respectively (P < 5 x 10-6), and meta-analysis in independent cohorts displayed similar associations with metformin response (P = 1.2 x 10-8 and P = 0.005, respectively). Previous studies have shown that PRPF31(+/-) knockout mice have increased total body fat (P = 1.78 x 10-6) and increased fasted circulating glucose (P = 5.73 x 10-6). Furthermore, rare variants in STAT3 associated with worse metformin response (q <0.1). STAT3 is a ubiquitously expressed pleiotropic transcriptional activator that participates in the regulation of metabolism and feeding behavior. Here, we provide novel evidence for associations of common and rare variants in PRPF31, CPA6, and STAT3 with metformin response that may provide insight into mechanisms important for metformin efficacy in T2D.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Metformin is associated with a reduced risk of some cancers but its effect on prostate cancer is unclear. Some studies suggest only Asians derive this benefit. Therefore, we undertook a systematic review with particular attention to ethnicity.

   METHODS: Medline, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and EBM Reviews were searched from inception to 2015. Two reviewers identified and abstracted articles. Studies were pooled using random effects model and stratified by Western- vs Asian-based populations.

   RESULTS: We identified 482 studies; 26 underwent full review. Of Western-based studies (n = 23), two were randomized trials and 21 were observational studies. All Asian-based studies (n = 3) were observational. There were 1,572,307 patients, 1,171,643 Western vs 400,664 Asian. Across all studies there was no association between metformin and prostate cancer (RR: 1.01, 95%CI: 0.86-1.18, I2: 97%), with similar findings in Western-based trials (RR: 1.38, 95%CI: 0.72-2.64 I2: 15%) and observational studies (RR: 1.03 95%CI: 0.94-1.13, I2: 88%). Asian-based studies suggested a non-significant reduction (RR: 0.75, 95%CI: 0.42-1.34, I2: 90%), although these results were highly influenced by one study of almost 400,000 patients (propensity-adjusted RR: 0.47 95%CI 0.45-0.49). Removing this influential study yielded an estimate more congruent with Western-based studies (RR: 0.98 95%CI:0.71-1.36, I2: 0%).

   CONCLUSION: There is likely no association between metformin and risk of prostate cancer, in either Western-based or Asian-based populations after removing a highly influential Asian-based study.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Vildagliptin is a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor commonly used as a dual oral agent with metformin, thiazolidinediones, or sulfonylurea for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The efficacy of dual therapy with vildagliptin and metformin has been established in randomized controlled trials, but there is little evidence from observational studies. The aims of the present study were to evaluate the effectiveness of vildagliptin as an add-on therapy to metformin in reducing HbA1c and its affects on body weight and blood lipids in a real-life setting.

   METHODS: Included in the present retrospective cohort were T2DM patients (n = 345) who were uncontrolled on metformin monotherapy and intensified treatment with vildagliptin. The efficacy of at least 90 days of dual therapy with vildagliptin and metformin in reducing HbA1c levels, as well as changes in blood lipids and body weight, were evaluated.

   RESULTS: After 180 days (range 90-365 days) from the index date with a mean daily dose of 92 mg vildagliptin, HbA1c was significantly (P < 0.001) reduced by an average of 0.9% (95% confidence interval -1.0%, -0.7%). The absolute reduction in HbA1c was positively associated with baseline HbA1c levels. In addition to HbA1c, a modest but significant (P < 0.05) decrement was also calculated in the patients' body weight and blood lipids.

   CONCLUSIONS: The present analysis of real-world data corroborates the results of previous randomized controlled trials indicating that add-on therapy with vildagliptin in uncontrolled patients on metformin monotherapy is associated with a significant improvement in the control of HbA1c.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: The Chinese herbal medicine Jinlida can significantly enhance the hypoglycemic action of metformin. However, the population showing the best responses to Jinlida has not been clarified. The aim of the present study was to compare the efficacy of Jinlida in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) after stratification.

   METHODS: Data were analyzed from a 12-week randomized placebo-controlled double-blind multicenter study with 192 T2DM patients (186 completed the study). The efficacy evaluation included HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and 2-h postprandial glucose (2hPG) levels stratified by baseline HbA1c, sex, age, body mass index (BMI), and duration of T2DM diagnosis. Homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and homeostatic model assessment of beta-cell function (HOMA-beta) were also evaluated stratified by baseline insulin levels.

   RESULTS: In the Jinlida group, HbA1c was significantly reduced (P < 0.05). Greater reductions were observed in patients with baseline HbA1c >8.5%, in males and in those aged >60 years, with a BMI <=24 kg/m2 , or with a duration of T2DM diagnosis >5 years (P < 0.05). Compared with baseline, Jinlida significantly alleviated insulin resistance (P < 0.05) in patients with baseline insulin levels >20 mU/L. Jinlida also significantly improved beta-cell function in patients with baseline insulin levels <=20 mU/L (P < 0.05).

   CONCLUSIONS: Jinlida significantly improved glycemic control, with greater improvements in patients with poor glycemic control and male, elderly, of normal weight, or with a long disease course. Furthermore, Jinlida alleviated insulin resistance with hyperinsulinemia and promoted insulin secretion with hypoinsulinemia. These results need to be further confirmed in clinical trials.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: Introduction: The early development and high incidence of cardiovascular lesion in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus is one of the most serious challenges for the diabetology worldwide. The aim: The purpose of the paper is to determine the dynamics of the insulin resistance indices in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus concomitant with coronary heart disease in the combination therapy with metformin and pioglitazone during 3 and 6 months.

   PATIENTS AND METHODS: Materials and methods: 95 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and coronary heart disease have been treated and randomized into two groups: the comparison group (n=37), treated with metformin and sulfonylureas, and the study group (n=58), treated with metformin in combination with pioglitazone. Prior, after 3 and 6 months of treatment C-peptide was assessed and index of the insulin resistance was calculated.

   RESULTS: Results: The resulting data proved the statistically significant lowering of the markers and level of the insulin resistance under the effect of combination treatment with metformin and pioglitazone.

   CONCLUSION: Conclusions: The proposed variant of the combination therapy has a positive effect on the clinical course of the coronary heart disease in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, well tolerated by the patients and can be considered as the pathogenetic factor in the treatment of these diseases.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND & AIMS: Metformin seems to have anticancer effects. However, it is not clear whether use of glycemia and metformin affect outcomes of patients with advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNETs). We investigated the association between glycemia and progression-free survival (PFS) of patients with pNETs treated with everolimus and/or somatostatin analogues, as well as the association between metformin use and PFS time.

   METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of 445 patients with advanced pNET treated at 24 medical centers in Italy from 1999 through 2015. Data on levels of glycemia were collected at time of diagnosis of pNET, before treatment initiation, and during treatment with everolimus (with or without somatostatin analogues), octreotide, or lanreotide. Diabetes was defined as prior or current use of glycemia control medication and/or fasting plasma glucose level >= 126 mg/dL, hemoglobin A1c >= 6.5% (48 mmol/L), or a random sample of plasma glucose >= 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L), with reported classic symptoms of hyperglycemia or hyperglycemic crisis. Patients were assigned to groups based on diagnosis of diabetes before or during antitumor therapy. PFS was compared between patients with vs without diabetes. Among patients with diabetes, the association between metformin use and PFS was assessed. We performed sensitivity and landmark analyses to exclude patients who developed diabetes while receiving cancer treatment and to exclude a potential immortal time bias related to metformin intake.

   RESULTS: PFS was significantly longer in patients with diabetes (median, 32.0 months) than without diabetes (median, 15.1 months) (hazard ratio for patients with vs without diabetes, 0.63; 95% confidence interval, 0.50-0.80; P = .0002). PFS of patients treated with metformin was significantly longer (median PFS, 44.2 months) than for patients without diabetes (hazard ratio for survival of patients with diabetes receiving metformin vs without diabetes, 0.45; 95% confidence interval, 0.32-0.62; P < .00001) and longer than for patients with diabetes receiving other treatments (median PFS, 20.8 months; hazard ratio, 0.49; 95% confidence interval, 0.34-0.69; P < .0001). In multivariable analysis, adjusted for other factors associated with outcomes, metformin was associated with longer PFS but level of glycemia was not. Metformin was associated with increased PFS of patients receiving somatostatin analogues and in those receiving everolimus, with or without somatostatin analogues. Sensitivity and landmark analyses produced similar results.

   CONCLUSIONS: In a retrospective study of patients with pNETs, we found a significant association between metformin use and longer PFS. Copyright © 2018 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Recent clinical trials indicated that metformin intake might play a protective role in the incidence and oncologic outcomes of various cancers. However, its protective effect on bladder cancer remains uncertain.

   METHODS: We performed a meta-analysis to investigate the association between metformin intake and bladder cancer risk as well as oncologic outcomes in diabetes mellitus (DM) patients. A comprehensive literature search was performed using PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Search Library in December 2017. Hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was pooled.

   RESULTS: A total of 9 retrospective cohort studies with 1,270,179 patients were included. A meta-analysis revealed that metformin intake was associated with an increased recurrence-free survival (HR = 0.55, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.35-0.88; P = .01; I = 64%), improved progression-free survival (HR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.51-0.96; P = .03; I = 33%), and prolonged cancer-specific survival (HR = 0.57, 95% CI = 0.40-0.81; P = .002; I = 0%). However, results demonstrated that metformin intake was not associated with a decreased incidence of bladder cancer (HR = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.61-1.09; P = .17; I = 85%) or an increased overall survival in bladder cancer patients (HR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.47-1.44; P = .50; I = 64%).

   CONCLUSION: The present meta-analysis indicated that metformin intake could improve the prognosis of bladder cancer patients. Further prospective cohort studies and mechanistic studies are still required to determine the precise role of metformin in the initiation and progression of bladder cancer.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: Metformin has an established role in the management of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Some patients cannot tolerate it due to associated gastrointestinal adverse events. The present study evaluated the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor sitagliptin as a potential treatment option in metformin-intolerant PCOS.

   METHODS: We conducted a 12-week, prospective, randomized, open-label study with 30 obese metformin-intolerant women with PCOS (age 35.0 +/- 7.2 years; body mass index, 36.9 +/- 5.5 kg/m2). After metformin withdrawal, they were randomized to lifestyle intervention and sitagliptin 100 mg daily (SITA) or lifestyle intervention alone as controls (CON). All participants underwent anthropometric and endocrine measurements and oral glucose tolerance testing. Model-derived indexes of insulin resistance and beta-cell function were calculated.

   RESULTS: SITA improved beta-cell function as assessed by the homeostasis model assessment for beta-cell function index (HOMA-B) of 45.9 +/- 35.8 ( P = .001), modified beta-cell function index (MBCI) of 7.9 +/- 7 ( P = .002), and quantitative insulin-sensitivity check index (QUICKI) of -0.03 +/- 0.03 ( P = .002). By contrast, beta-cell function decreased in CON. The between-group differences were significant for HOMA-B ( P = 0.001), MBCI ( P = .010), and QUICKI ( P = .025). The conversion rate to impaired glucose homeostasis was prevented in SITA: 3 of 15 subjects had impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) before and after the study. In CON, none had type 2 diabetes (T2D), and 4 had IGT at the beginning. After 12 weeks, IGT was observed in 2 and T2D in 3 subjects.

   CONCLUSION: SITA improved beta-cell function and prevented a conversion to IGT and T2D in metformin-intolerant obese PCOS patients.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety of Sancai powder in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) inadequately controlled with single oral metformin in a randomized controlled trial (RCT).

   METHODS: A total of 132 patients with T2DM were enrolled in the study, who only took metformin (500-1000 mg/day) for at least three months and with inadequate glycemic control (7.0% <= hemoglobin A1c <= 9.0% ) in the past three months. The patients stopped taking metformin with lifestyle interventions for three weeks, and 105 patients qualified for the program. They were randomly divided into the Sancai powder group and the metformin group (1500 mg/day). The follow-up period was for 12 weeks. Comparisons of several variables were analyzed.

   RESULTS: No significant differences were found between the two groups in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and 2 h post-meal glucose (2hPG), although they had decreased significantly (P < 0.01). Homeostasis model assessment of beta cell function index was significantly improved in Sancai powder group (P < 0.01), and there were significant differences in the changes of homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance and insulin sensitivity index in the two groups (P < 0.05). Sancai powder significantly reduced triglyceride level (P < 0.05), although there was no significant difference in the body weight and body mass index in the two groups.

   CONCLUSION: In this 12-week study, Sancai powder could significantly reduce hemoglobin A1c, FPG and 2hPG levels, improved beta-cell function and insulin resistance of the T2DM inadequately controlled with metformin.

Abstract
  Metformin prevents weight gain in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, the mechanisms involved are still unknown. In this post hoc analysis of the HOME trial, we aimed to determine whether metformin affects energy intake. Patients with T2D were treated with 850 mg metformin or received placebo added to insulin (1-3 times daily) for 4.3 years. Dietary intake was assessed at baseline, after 1 year and after 4.3 years, according to the dietary history method. Among the 310 included participants, 179 (93 placebo, 86 metformin) completed all 3 dietary assessments. We found no significant difference in energy intake after 4.3 years between the groups (metformin vs placebo: -31.0 kcal/d; 95% CI, -107.4 to 45.4; F-value, 1.3; df = 415; P = .27). Body weight in placebo users increased significantly more than in metformin-users during 4.3 years (4.9 +/- 4.9 vs 1.1 +/- 5.2 kg; t test: P <= .001). Linear mixed models did not show a significant effect of energy intake as explanation for the difference in weight gain between the groups (F-value, 0.1; df = 1; P = .82). In conclusion, the prevention of weight gain by metformin cannot be explained by reduced energy intake. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Abstract
  AIMS: To compare the efficacy and safety of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4is) and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is) as monotherapy or add-on to metformin (Met) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: PubMed, Embase and ClinicalTrials.gov sites were systematically searched for randomized controlled trials to assess the efficacy and safety of DPP-4is and SGLT-2is in patients with T2DM. Risk ratio (RR) and weighted mean difference (WMD) were used to evaluate outcomes.

   RESULTS: In the analysis of 25 randomized trials, which involved 14 619 patients, SGLT-2is were associated with a significantly stronger reduction in haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) (WMD 0.13%, 95% credible interval [CI], 0.04%-0.22%, P = .005) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (WMD 0.80 mmol/L, 95% CI, 0.58-1.01 mmol/L, P < .00001) than were DPP-4is. However, no significant difference between the 2 drug categories was found in the risk of hypoglycaemic events (RR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.78-1.26, P = .92). SGLT-2is plus Met was associated with a more significant decrease in FPG (WMD 0.71 mmol/L, 95% CI, 0.43-1.00 mmol/L, P < .00001) than was DPP-4is plus Met. However, no differences were found in the reduction of HbA1c (WMD 0.11%, 95% CI, -0.03%-0.25%, P = .12) or the risk of hypoglycaemic events (RR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.80-1.31, P = .86).

   CONCLUSIONS: This review revealed that, compared to DPP-4is, SGLT-2is significantly reduced HbA1c, FPG and body weight without increasing the risk of hypoglycaemia in diabetes treatment. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Abstract
  This study assessed the efficacy of insulin degludec/liraglutide (IDegLira) vs insulin glargine U100 (IGlar) across categories of baseline glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c; <=7.5%, >7.5% to <=8.5% and >8.5%), body mass index (BMI; <30, >=30 to <35 and >=35 kg/m2 ) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG; <7.2 and >=7.2 mmol/L) in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) uncontrolled on basal insulin, using post hoc analyses of the DUAL V 26-week trial. With IDegLira, mean HbA1c was reduced across all baseline HbA1c (1.0%-2.5%), FPG (1.5%-1.9%) and BMI categories (1.8%-1.9%), with significantly greater reductions compared with IGlar U100. For all HbA1c, FPG and BMI categories, IDegLira resulted in weight loss and IGlar U100 in weight gain; hypoglycaemia rates were lower for IDegLira vs IGlar U100. More patients achieved HbA1c <7% with IDegLira than IGlar U100 across all HbA1c (59%-87% vs 31%-66%), FPG (71%-74% vs 40%-51%) and BMI categories (71%-73% vs 40%-54%). IDegLira improved glycaemic control and induced weight loss in patients with T2D previously uncontrolled on basal insulin, across the categories of baseline HbA1c, FPG or BMI that were tested.

Abstract
  AIM: Approximately half of the participants in the Diabetes Prevention Outcomes Study (DPPOS) had diabetes after 15 years of follow-up, whereas nearly all the others remained with pre-diabetes. We examined whether formerly unexplored factors in the DPPOS coexisted with known risk factors that posed additional risk for, or protection from, diabetes as well as microvascular disease.

   METHODS: Cox proportional hazard models were used to examine predictors of diabetes. Sequential modelling procedures considered known and formerly unexplored factors. We also constructed models to determine whether the same unexplored factors that associated with progression to diabetes also predicted the prevalence of microvascular disease. Hazard ratios (HR) are per standard deviation change in the variable.

   RESULTS: In models adjusted for demographics and known diabetes risk factors, two formerly unknown factors were associated with risk for both diabetes and microvascular disease: number of medications taken (HR = 1.07, 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) 1.03 to 1.12 for diabetes; odds ratio (OR) = 1.10, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.16 for microvascular disease) and variability in HbA1c (HR = 1.02, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.03 for diabetes; OR = 1.06, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.09 for microvascular disease per sd). Total comorbidities increased risk for diabetes (HR = 1.10, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.16), whereas higher systolic (OR = 1.22, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.31) and diastolic (OR = 1.14, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.22) blood pressure, as well as the use of anti-hypertensives (OR = 1.41, 95% CI 1.23 to 1.62), increased risk of microvascular disease.

   CONCLUSIONS: Several formerly unexplored factors in the DPPOS predicted additional risk for diabetes and/or microvascular disease - particularly hypertension and the use of anti-hypertensive medications - helping to explain some of the residual disease risk in participants of the DPPOS.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: This study is to compare the effects of Liraglutide and Metformin alone or combined treatment on the cardiac function in T2DM patients complicated with CAD.

   METHODS: 120 T2DM patients were included at Endocrinology Department of Tianjin First Center Hospital (Tianjin, China) from April 2012 to September 2013. The study contained two sections. Section 1: 30 patients in group 1 was treated with Liraglutide (Novo Nordisk) (1.2 mg/d), and 30 patients in group 2 with Metformin (Shiguibao) (1500 mg/d) for 24 weeks. Section 2: 30 patients in group1 was treated with Liraglutide (1.8 mg/d) and 30 in group 2 with Liraglutide (1.2 mg/d) plus Metformin (1500 mg/d) for 24 weeks. Fasting blood glucose (FBG), postprandial glucose (PPG), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), body mass index (BMI), blood pressure (BP), triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), C reactive protein (CRP), left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD), ejection fraction (EF) and the ratio of early (E) to late (A) ventricular filling velocities (E/A ratio) were measured before and after the 24-week treatment.

   RESULTS: After 24-week treatment, when blood glucose level was controlled in 4 groups, Liraglutide alone treatment showed better improvements than on all measuring except TG in Section 1, however, combined treatment of Liraglutide and Metformin showed better improvements on all measuring except BMI, TG and BP in Section 2.

   CONCLUSIONS: With similar glycemic control, the Liraglutide (1.2 mg/d) monotherapy showed the better effects than either Metformin alone, or combination of Liraglutide and Metformin on lipid metabolism and cardiovascular function.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: ITCA 650 is a subdermal osmotic mini-pump that continuously delivers exenatide subcutaneously for 3-6 months. The efficacy, safety, and tolerability of ITCA 650 added to diet and exercise alone or combined with metformin, sulfonylurea, or thiazolidinedione monotherapy or a combination of these drugs was evaluated in poorly controlled patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) who were ineligible for participation in a placebo-controlled study (FREEDOM-1) because of severe hyperglycemia (HbA1c >10% [86 mmol/mol]).

   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This 39-week, open-label, phase 3 trial enrolled patients aged 18-80 years with HbA1c >10% to <=12% (86-108 mmol/mol) and BMI 25-45 kg/m2. Patients received ITCA 650 20 mug/day for 13 weeks, then 60 mug/day for 26 weeks. The primary end point was change in HbA1c at week 39.

   RESULTS: Sixty patients were enrolled. At baseline, mean HbA1c was 10.8% (94.7 mmol/mol) and mean (+/- SD) duration of diabetes was 8.6 (+/- 5.3) years. At week 39, there was a mean reduction in HbA1c of -2.8% (-30.3 mmol/mol; P < 0.001 vs. baseline) and in body weight of -1.2 kg (P = 0.105), and 25% of patients achieved HbA1c <7% (53 mmol/mol). A reduction in HbA1c of >=1% (>=10.9 mmol/mol) occurred in 90% of patients. The most common adverse events were nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and headache. Gastrointestinal adverse events were generally transient and subsided over time; only 4 patients (6.7%) discontinued for gastrointestinal events.

   CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with ITCA 650, the first injection-free glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist, resulted in significant improvements in glycemic control in poorly controlled long-standing T2D patients with a high baseline HbA1c >10%.

Abstract
  PURPOSE: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients treated with metformin are predisposed to develop contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) after received emergency contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) examination. We evaluated the protective effects of alprostadil on CIN in T2DM patients treated with metformin after contrast media (CM) administration.

   METHODS: In this single-institution, single-blind, superiority trial, we randomly assigned 451 T2DM patients taking metformin and underwent emergency contrast-enhanced CT examination to either the alprostadil group (227 patients) receiving alprostadil or the control group (224 patients) without alprostadil. All subjects stopped taking metformin and drank 500 ml water within 12 h after CM exposure. In addition, patients in the alprostadil group were injected with alprostadil (10 mug/day, for 3 days) plus 20 ml normal saline (alprostadil hydration) and the control group patients were daily injected with 20 ml normal saline as control for 3 days following CM administration. Serum creatinine (Scr) was measured before and <72 h after contrast-enhanced CT examination. CIN was defined as an increase in Scr >= 44.2 micromol/l (0.5 mg/dL) or >25% over baseline within 3 days of contrast administration.

   RESULTS: There was a lower incidence of CIN in patients underwent alprostadil hydration than drinking water monohydration after CM administration, who with either normal renal function or chronic kidney disease (baseline eGFR < 60 ml.min-1.1.73 m-2).

   CONCLUSIONS: Alprostadil hydration was superior to drinking water monohydration regarding preventing CIN in T2DM patients treated with metformin after contrast-enhanced CT.

Abstract
  AIM: To determine whether lixisenatide, a prandial short-acting glucagon-like peptide receptor agonist (GLP-1RA), ameliorates postprandial glomerular hyperfiltration in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) compared with insulin-glulisine (iGlu).

   METHODS: Postprandial renal haemodynamic effects of 8-week treatment with lixisenatide 20 microg vs once-daily titrated iGlu were measured in 35 overweight patients with T2DM inadequately controlled on insulin-glargine, with or without metformin [mean +/- SD age 62 +/- 7 years, HbA1c 8.0% +/- 0.9%, estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) 85 +/- 12 mL/min/1.73 m2 , median (IQR) urinary albumin/creatinine ratio 1.5 (0.9-3.0) mg/mmol]. After a standardised breakfast, GFR (primary endpoint) and effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) were determined by inulin and para-aminohippuric acid renal clearance, respectively, based on timed urine sampling. Intrarenal haemodynamic functions were estimated using Gomez equations.

   RESULTS: Compared with iGlu, lixisenatide did not affect GFR [+0.1 mL/min/1.73 m2 (95% CI -9 to 9)], ERPF [-17 mL/min/1.73 m2 (-61 to 26)], other (intra-)renal haemodynamics or renal damage markers, but increased fractional sodium excretion [+0.25% (0.09-0.41)] and urinary pH [+0.7 (0.3-1.2)]. Plasma renin, angiotensin-II and aldosterone were unchanged. Lixisenatide and iGlu reduced HbA1c similarly, by 0.8% +/- 0.1% and 0.6% +/- 0.1%, respectively, while postprandial glucose was lower with lixisenatide (P = .002). Compared with iGlu, lixisenatide reduced bodyweight [-1.4 kg (-2.5 to -0.2)] and increased postprandial mean arterial pressure [+9 mm Hg (4-14)].

   CONCLUSION: Eight-week lixisenatide treatment does not affect postprandial (intra-)renal haemodynamics compared with iGlu when added to insulin-glargine in patients with T2DM without overt nephropathy. Prolonged lixisenatide treatment has a sustained natriuretic effect, which is in contrast to previous reports on long-acting GLP-1RA, reduces body weight and increases postprandial blood pressure compared with iGlu.

Abstract
  AIMS: Diabetes is associated with an excess release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and an enhanced NETosis, a neutrophil cell death programme instrumental to anti-microbial defences, but also involved in tissue damage. We herein investigated whether the antidiabetic drug metformin protects against NETosis.

   METHODS: We measured NET components in the plasma of patients with pre-diabetes who were randomized to receive metformin or placebo for 2 months. To control for the effect on glucose, we also measured NET components in the plasma of patients with type 2 diabetes before and after treatment with insulin or dapagliflozin. In vitro, we used static and dynamic imaging with advanced live confocal two-photon microscopy to evaluate the effects of metformin on cellular events during NETosis. We examined putative molecular mechanisms by monitoring chromatin decondensation and DNA release in vitro.

   RESULTS: Metformin, as compared to placebo, significantly reduced the concentrations of NET components elastase, proteinase-3, histones and double strand DNA, whereas glucose control with insulin or dapagliflozin exerted no significant effect. In vitro, metformin prevented pathologic changes in nuclear dynamics and DNA release, resulting in a blunted NETosis in response to phorbol myristate acetate and calcium influx. Metformin prevented membrane translocation of PKC-betaII and activation of NADPH oxidase in neutrophils, both of which diminished the NETosis response.

   CONCLUSIONS: Metformin treatment reduced the concentrations of NET components independently from glucose control. This effect was reproducible in vitro and was related to the inhibitory effect exerted by metformin on the PKC-NADPH oxidase pathway.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety of once-weekly semaglutide 1.0 mg s.c. with exenatide extended release (ER) 2.0 mg s.c. in subjects with type 2 diabetes.

   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this phase 3a, open-label, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial, 813 subjects with type 2 diabetes taking oral antidiabetic drugs were randomized (1:1) to semaglutide 1.0 mg or exenatide ER 2.0 mg for 56 weeks. The primary end point was change from baseline in HbA1c at week 56.

   RESULTS: Mean HbA1c (8.3% [67.7 mmol/mol] at baseline) was reduced by 1.5% (16.8 mmol/mol) with semaglutide and 0.9% (10.0 mmol/mol) with exenatide ER (estimated treatment difference vs. exenatide ER [ETD] -0.62% [95% CI -0.80, -0.44] [-6.78 mmol/mol (95% CI -8.70, -4.86)]; P < 0.0001 for noninferiority and superiority). Mean body weight (95.8 kg at baseline) was reduced by 5.6 kg with semaglutide and 1.9 kg with exenatide ER (ETD -3.78 kg [95% CI -4.58, -2.98]; P < 0.0001). Significantly more subjects treated with semaglutide (67%) achieved HbA1c <7.0% (<53 mmol/mol) versus those taking exenatide ER (40%). Both treatments had similar safety profiles, but gastrointestinal adverse events were more common in semaglutide-treated subjects (41.8%) than in exenatide ER-treated subjects (33.3%); injection-site reactions were more frequent with exenatide ER (22.0%) than with semaglutide (1.2%).

   CONCLUSIONS: Semaglutide 1.0 mg was superior to exenatide ER 2.0 mg in improving glycemic control and reducing body weight after 56 weeks of treatment; the drugs had comparable safety profiles. These results indicate that semaglutide treatment is highly effective for subjects with type 2 diabetes who are inadequately controlled on oral antidiabetic drugs.

Abstract
  AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Metformin is the most-prescribed oral medication to lower blood glucose worldwide. Yet previous systematic reviews have raised doubts about its effectiveness in reducing risk of cardiovascular disease, the most costly complication of type 2 diabetes. We aimed to systematically identify and pool randomised trials reporting cardiovascular outcomes in which the effect of metformin was 'isolated' through comparison to diet, lifestyle or placebo.

   METHODS: We performed an electronic literature search of MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library. We also manually screened the reference lists of previous meta-analyses of trials of metformin identified through a MEDLINE search. We included randomised controlled trials of adults with type 2 diabetes comparing any dose and preparation of oral metformin with no intervention, placebo or a lifestyle intervention and reporting mortality or a cardiovascular outcome.

   RESULTS: We included ten articles reporting 13 trials (including a total of 2079 individuals with type 2 diabetes allocated to metformin and a similar number to comparison groups) of which only four compared metformin with placebo and collected data on cardiovascular outcomes. Participants were mainly white, aged <=65 years, overweight/obese and with poor glycaemic control. Summary estimates were based on a small number of events: 416 myocardial infarctions/ischaemic heart disease events in seven studies and 111 strokes in four studies. The UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) contributed the majority of data to the summary estimates, with weights ranging from 52.3% for myocardial infarction to 70.5% for stroke. All outcomes, with the exception of stroke, favoured metformin, with limited heterogeneity between studies, but none achieved statistical significance. Effect sizes (Mantel-Haenszel RR) were: all-cause mortality 0.96 (95% CI 0.84, 1.09); cardiovascular death 0.97 (95% CI 0.80, 1.16); myocardial infarction 0.89 (95% CI 0.75, 1.06); stroke 1.04 (95% CI 0.73, 1.48); and peripheral vascular disease 0.81 (95% CI 0.50, 1.31).

   CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: There remains uncertainty about whether metformin reduces risk of cardiovascular disease among patients with type 2 diabetes, for whom it is the recommended first-line drug. Although this is mainly due to absence of evidence, it is unlikely that a definitive placebo-controlled cardiovascular endpoint trial among people with diabetes will be forthcoming. Alternative approaches to reduce the uncertainty include the use of electronic health records in long-term pragmatic evaluations, inclusion of metformin in factorial trials, publication of cardiovascular outcome data from adverse event reporting in trials of metformin and a cardiovascular endpoint trial of metformin among people without diabetes.

Abstract
  Multiple epidemiological studies have documented an association between metformin, used for treatment of type 2 diabetes, and reduced cancer incidence and mortality. Cell line models may not accurately reflect the effects of metformin in the clinical setting. Moreover, findings from animal model studies have been inconsistent, whilst those from more recent epidemiological studies have tempered the overall effect size. The purpose of this review is to examine metformin's chemopreventive potential by outlining relevant mechanisms of action, the most recent epidemiologic evidence, and recently completed and ongoing clinical trials. Although repurposing drugs with excellent safety profiles is an appealing strategy for cancer prevention and treatment in the adjuvant setting, there is no substitute for well-executed, large randomised clinical trials to define efficacy and determine the populations that are most likely to benefit from an intervention. Thus, enthusiasm remains for understanding the role of metformin in cancer through ongoing clinical research.

Abstract
  The largest and longest clinical trial of metformin for the prevention of diabetes is the Diabetes Prevention Program/Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPP/DPPOS). In this review, we summarise data from the DPP/DPPOS, focusing on metformin for diabetes prevention, as well as its long-term glycaemic and cardiometabolic effects and safety in people at high-risk of developing diabetes. The DPP (1996-2001) was a RCT of 3234 adults who, at baseline, were at high-risk of developing diabetes. Participants were assigned to masked placebo (n = 1082) or metformin (n = 1073) 850 mg twice daily, or intensive lifestyle intervention (n = 1079). The masked metformin/placebo intervention phase ended approximately 1 year ahead of schedule because of demonstrated efficacy. Primary outcome was reported at 2.8 years. At the end of the DPP, all participants were offered lifestyle education and 88% (n = 2776) of the surviving DPP cohort continued follow-up in the DPPOS. Participants originally assigned to metformin continued to receive metformin, unmasked. The DPP/DPPOS cohort has now been followed for over 15 years with prospective assessment of glycaemic, cardiometabolic, health economic and safety outcomes. After an average follow-up of 2.8 years, metformin reduced the incidence of diabetes by 31% compared with placebo, with a greater effect in those who were more obese, had a higher fasting glucose or a history of gestational diabetes. The DPPOS addressed the longer-term effects of metformin, showing a risk reduction of 18% over 10 and 15 years post-randomisation. Metformin treatment for diabetes prevention was estimated to be cost-saving. At 15 years, lack of progression to diabetes was associated with a 28% lower risk of microvascular complications across treatment arms, a reduction that was no different among treatment groups. Recent findings suggest metformin may reduce atherosclerosis development in men. Originally used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, metformin, now proven to prevent or delay diabetes, may serve as an important tool in battling the growing diabetes epidemic. Long-term follow-up, currently underway in the DPP/DPPOS, is now evaluating metformin's potential role, when started early in the spectrum of dysglycaemia, on later-stage comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease and cancer.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: Explore the cost-effectiveness of lifestyle interventions and metformin in reducing subsequent incidence of type 2 diabetes, both alone and in combination with a screening programme to identify high-risk individuals.

   DESIGN: Systematic review of economic evaluations.

   DATA SOURCES AND ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Database searches (Embase, Medline, PreMedline, NHS EED) and citation tracking identified economic evaluations of lifestyle interventions or metformin alone or in combination with screening programmes in people at high risk of developing diabetes. The International Society for Pharmaco-economics and Outcomes Research's Questionnaire to Assess Relevance and Credibility of Modelling Studies for Informing Healthcare Decision Making was used to assess study quality.

   RESULTS: 27 studies were included; all had evaluated lifestyle interventions and 12 also evaluated metformin. Primary studies exhibited considerable heterogeneity in definitions of pre-diabetes and intensity and duration of lifestyle programmes. Lifestyle programmes and metformin appeared to be cost effective in preventing diabetes in high-risk individuals (median incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of 7490/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) and 8428/QALY, respectively) but economic estimates varied widely between studies. Intervention-only programmes were in general more cost effective than programmes that also included a screening component. The longer the period evaluated, the more cost-effective interventions appeared. In the few studies that evaluated other economic considerations, budget impact of prevention programmes was moderate (0.13%-0.2% of total healthcare budget), financial payoffs were delayed (by 9-14 years) and impact on incident cases of diabetes was limited (0.1%-1.6% reduction). There was insufficient evidence to answer the question of (1) whether lifestyle programmes are more cost effective than metformin or (2) whether low-intensity lifestyle interventions are more cost effective than the more intensive lifestyle programmes that were tested in trials.

   CONCLUSIONS: The economics of preventing diabetes are complex. There is some evidence that diabetes prevention programmes are cost effective, but the evidence base to date provides few clear answers regarding design of prevention programmes because of differences in denominator populations, definitions, interventions and modelling assumptions.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of sitagliptin compared to sulfonylureas as add-on to metformin in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus from both randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and 'real-world' non-randomised studies.

   METHODS AND ANALYSES: We conducted a systematic review of EMBASE, MEDLINE, CENTRAL and grey literature for RCTs and non-randomised studies. We reported outcomes relating to change in HbA1c, fasting glucose, weight, blood pressure and lipids from baseline and need for treatment change. No study investigating macrovascular and microvascular diabetes complications was found. Meta-analysis was used where studies were sufficiently homogenous.

   RESULTS: Seven RCTs and five non-randomised studies were eligible for inclusion from 1335 articles retrieved. Meta-analysis of three homogenous RCTs revealed a statistically significant decrease in weight with sitagliptin when compared to sulfonylureas (weighted mean difference (WMD) -2.05 kg; 95% CI -2.38 to -1.71); however, a similar change from baseline in HbA1c (WMD 0.05; 95% CI -0.03 to 0.12), fasting glucose (WMD 0.11; 95% CI -0.08 to -0.29), blood pressure, lipids and the proportion achieving HbA1c <7% by study end (OR 0.98; 95% CI 0.85 to 1.13) was observed.Non-randomised studies identified consisted of four prospective and one retrospective cohort study. Three of these five studies were of moderate/high quality, and results though less precise suggested similar real-world comparative glycaemic and weight effectiveness for both treatments. Data from two cohort studies suggested that treatment change (HR 0.65; 95% CI 0.57 to 0.73) and insulin initiation (HR 0.76; 95% CI 0.65 to 0.90) were less likely among those prescribed sitagliptin; however, inadequate reporting of HbA1c at time of treatment change made interpreting results challenging.

   CONCLUSION: Sitagliptin users experienced modest weight loss compared to gain with sulfonylureas; however, this difference was around 2 kg, which may not be of major clinical significance for most individuals. Similar change was observed across most other effectiveness outcomes reported. Further studies are needed to address longer-term effectiveness outcomes for sitagliptin compared to sulfonylureas as add-on to metformin.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Metformin use reduces the incidence and severity of stroke in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). The benefits of metformin for stroke have not been examined in hemodialysis patients with DM.

   METHODS AND RESULTS: Using the National Health Insurance Research Database, we identified 17 760 patients with DM and new-onset hemodialysis between 2001 and 2013. Of these, 1898 patients hospitalized for either ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke were matched to 7592 control patients according to sex, age, and year of initial hemodialysis therapy by using incidence sampling. The association between metformin use and stroke risk was estimated using conditional logistic regression after adjustment for hemodialysis frequency, comorbidity, and prescribed medications. Metformin use was recorded before the date of stroke admission and the date of pseudostroke of the case and control patients, respectively. Results showed that hemodialysis patients with ischemic stroke were more likely to use metformin than the controls 1 year before the date of stroke admission (adjusted odds ratio: 1.64; 95% confidence interval, 1.32-2.04). The association was evident within 90 days before the index date (adjusted odds ratio: 1.81; 95% confidence interval, 1.27-2.60). The results were consistent with those of hemodialysis patients with hemorrhagic stroke. Metformin use remained a risk factor for stroke in patients treated with antihypertensive, sulfonylurea, and antiplatelet drugs.

   CONCLUSIONS: This nested case-control study is the first to show that metformin use is associated with stroke risk in hemodialysis patients with DM. We suggest that metformin should not be used by hemodialysis patients with DM. Copyright © 2017 The Authors. Published on behalf of the American Heart Association, Inc., by Wiley.

Abstract
  AIMS: To investigate the association between serum orexin concentrations and insulin resistance/sensitivity in a sample of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, and to study the effects of anti-hyperglycemic treatment on orexin concentrations over three months.

   METHODS: This study was designed as a randomized, open-label, clinical trial. Before allocation, sixty medication-naive, newly-diagnosed, type 2 diabetes patients underwent a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Afterwards, using a randomized trial design (IRCT201102275917N1) patients were allocated to either the metformin (1000 mg daily) or pioglitazone (30 mg daily) arm, and were reexamined after three months. Serum insulin, plasma glucose, and orexin concentrations were measured at baseline, during OGTT, and after three months.

   RESULTS: Orexin concentrations significantly decreased after OGTT (0 vs. 120 min: 0.63 +/- 0.07 vs. 0.31 +/- 0.03 ng/ml, p < 0.001). Insulin resistance determined by homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was significantly and negatively correlated with orexin (r = -0.301, p = 0.024). Furthermore, orexin concentrations were significantly and positively correlated with the insulin sensitivity index derived from OGTT (r = 0.326, p = 0.014). Three-month treatment with metformin and pioglitazone significantly improved insulin sensitivity and increased orexin concentrations by 26% (p = 0.025) and 14% (p = 0.076), respectively. Between-group analysis showed that changes in orexin concentrations with metformin and pioglitazone were not significantly different (p = 0.742).

   CONCLUSIONS: There was a negative association between peripheral orexin concentrations and insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes patients. Three-month anti-hyperglycemic treatment with proportionate doses of metformin or pioglitazone increased orexin concentrations via amelioration of insulin resistance and improvement of glycemic control.

Abstract
  AIMS: There is a large population of people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who are Muslim and fast during Ramadan. Changes in the pattern and amount of meal and fluid intake during Ramadan, in addition to the long fasting hours, may increase the risk of hypoglycaemia, hyperglycaemia, and dehydration. The Canagliflozin in Ramadan Tolerance Observational Study (CRATOS) evaluated the tolerability of canagliflozin, a sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor, compared with sulphonylureas among patients with T2DM who fast during Ramadan.

   METHODS: This non-randomised, parallel-cohort, prospective, comparative, observational study was conducted in the Middle East during Ramadan and enrolled patients who were taking canagliflozin (n=162) or any sulphonylurea (n=159) added to metformin+/-dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor. The proportion of patients who experienced hypoglycaemia events was assessed as the primary end-point. Between-cohort comparisons were adjusted using propensity score analysis.

   RESULTS: During Ramadan, fewer patients experienced symptomatic hypoglycaemia with canagliflozin vs sulphonylurea (adjusted odds ratio: 0.273 [95% CI: 0.104, 0.719]). Of hypoglycaemia events for which blood glucose was measured, two of six with canagliflozin and 27 of 37 with sulphonylurea were confirmed by blood glucose <3.9 mmol/L. More patients treated with canagliflozin experienced volume depletion events compared with sulphonylurea (adjusted odds ratio: 3.5 [95% CI: 1.3, 9.2]). Missed fasting days were few and medication adherence was high in both groups. No patients treated with canagliflozin and 9.4% treated with sulphonylurea adjusted their medication dose near the beginning of Ramadan. Both treatments were generally well tolerated, with low rates of adverse events and no serious adverse events in either group.

   CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these findings support the use of canagliflozin for the treatment of adults with T2DM who fast during Ramadan. CLINICALTRIALS.

Abstract
  AIM: To confirm glycaemic control superiority of mealtime fast-acting insulin aspart (faster aspart) in a basal-bolus (BB) regimen vs basal-only insulin.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this open-label, randomized, 18-week trial (51 sites; 6 countries), adults (n = 236) with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes (T2D; mean glycosylated haemoglobin [HbA1c] +/- SD: 7.9% +/- 0.7% [63.1 +/- 7.5 mmol/mol]) receiving basal insulin and oral antidiabetic drugs underwent 8-week optimization of prior once-daily basal insulin followed by randomization 1:1 to either a BB regimen with faster aspart (n = 116) or continuation of once-daily basal insulin (n = 120), both with metformin. Primary endpoint was HbA1c change from baseline after 18 weeks of treatment. Secondary endpoints included: postprandial plasma glucose (PPG) change and overall PPG increment (all meals); weight; treatment-emergent adverse events; hypoglycaemic episodes.

   RESULTS: HbA1c decreased from 7.9% (63.2 mmol/mol) to 6.8% (50.7 mmol/mol; BB group) and from 7.9% (63.2 mmol/mol) to 7.7% (60.7 mmol/mol; basal-only group); estimated treatment difference [95% confidence interval] -0.94% [-1.17; -0.72]; -10.3 mmol/mol [-12.8; -7.8]; P < .0001. Reductions from baseline in overall mean 2-hour PPG and overall PPG increment for all meals (self-measured plasma glucose profiles) were statistically significant in favour of BB treatment ( P < .0001). Severe/blood glucose confirmed hypoglycaemia rate (12.8 vs 2.0 episodes per patient-years of exposure), total daily insulin (1.2 vs 0.6 U/kg) and weight gain (1.8 vs 0.2 kg) were greater with BB than with basal-only treatment.

   CONCLUSIONS: In T2D, faster aspart in a BB regimen provided superior glycaemic control as compared with basal-only insulin, but with an increase in the frequency of hypoglycaemia and modest weight gain.

Abstract
  PURPOSE: To compare the effect of liraglutide, sitagliptin and insulin glargine added to standard therapy on left ventricular function in post-ischemic type-2 diabetes mellitus patients.

   METHODS: We evaluated 32 type-2 diabetes mellitus Caucasians with history of post-ischemic chronic heart failure NYHA class II/III and/or left ventricular ejection fraction <=45 %. Participants underwent laboratory determinations, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, Minnesota Living with Heart Failure questionnaire and 6 min walking test at baseline and following 52 weeks treatment. Patients were treated with standard therapy for chronic heart failure and were randomized to receive liraglutide, sitagliptin and glargine in addition to metformin and/or sulfonylurea.

   RESULTS: Liraglutide treatment induced an improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction from 41.5 +/- 2.2 to 46.3 +/- 3 %; P = 0.001). On the contrary, treatment with sitagliptin and glargine induced no changes in left ventricular ejection fraction (41.8 +/- 2.6 vs. 42.5 +/- 2.5 % and 42 +/- 1.5 vs. 42 +/- 1.6 %, respectively; P = NS). Indexed end-systolic LV volume was reduced only in liraglutide-treated patients (51 +/- 9 vs. 43 +/- 8 ml/m2; P < 0.05). Liraglutide treatment induced also a significant increase in the anterograde stroke volume (39 +/- 9 vs. 49 +/- 11 ml; P < 0.05), whereas no differences were observed in the other two groups. Cardiac output and cardiac index showed a significant increase only in liraglutide-treated patients (4.4 +/- 0.5 vs. 5.0 +/- 0.6 L/min; P < 0.05 and 1.23 +/- 0.26 vs. 1.62 +/- 0.29 L/m2; P = 0.005, respectively). Liraglutide treatment was also associated with an improvement of functional capacity and an improvement of quality of life.

   CONCLUSIONS: These data provide evidence that treatment with liraglutide is associated with improvement of cardiac function and functional capacity in failing post-ischemic type-2 diabetes mellitus patients.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To evaluate safety and efficacy of IONIS-PTP-1BRx, a second-generation 2'-O-methoxyethyl antisense inhibitor of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B, as add-on therapy in overweight patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin with or without sulfonylurea therapy.

   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this phase II, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial, overweight and obese patients (BMI >=27 kg/m2) with type 2 diabetes (HbA1c >=7.5% [58 mmol/mol] and <=10.5% [91 mmol/mol]) on a stable dose of metformin alone or with sulfonylurea were randomized 2:1 to IONIS-PTP-1BRx 200 mg (n = 62) or placebo (n = 30) once weekly for 26 weeks.

   RESULTS: Mean baseline HbA1c was 8.6% (70 mmol/mol) and 8.7% (72 mmol/mol) in placebo and active treatment, respectively. At week 27, IONIS-PTP-1BRx reduced mean HbA1c levels by -0.44% (-4.8 mmol/mol; P = 0.074) from baseline and improved leptin (-4.4 ng/mL; P = 0.007) and adiponectin (0.99 mug/mL; P = 0.026) levels compared with placebo. By week 36, mean HbA1c was significantly reduced (-0.69% [-7.5 mmol/mol]; P = 0.034) and accompanied by reductions in fructosamine (-33.2 mumol/L; P = 0.005) and glycated albumin (-1.6%; P = 0.031) versus placebo. Despite both treatment groups receiving similar lifestyle counseling, mean body weight significantly decreased from baseline to week 27 with IONIS-PTP-1BRx versus placebo (-2.6 kg; P = 0.002) independent of HbA1c reduction (R2 = 0.0020). No safety concerns were identified in the study.

   CONCLUSIONS: Compared with placebo, IONIS-PTP-1BRx treatment for 26 weeks produced prolonged reductions in HbA1c, improved medium-term glycemic parameters, reduced leptin and increased adiponectin levels, and resulted in a distinct body weight-reducing effect.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: The gut microbiota is known to be related to type 2 diabetes (T2D), psychiatric conditions, and opioid use. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that variability in gut microbiota in T2D is associated with psycho-metabolic health.

   METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among African American men (AAM) (n = 99) that were outpatients at a Chicago VA Medical Center. The main outcome measures included fecal microbiota ecology (by 16S rRNA gene sequencing), psychiatric disorders including opioid use, and circulating leptin and oxytocin as representative hormone biomarkers for obesity and psychological pro-social behavior.

   RESULTS: The study subjects had prevalent overweight/obesity (78%), T2D (50%) and co-morbid psychiatric (65%) and opioid use (45%) disorders. In the analysis of microbiota, the data showed interactions of opioids, T2D and metformin with Bifidobacterium and Prevotella genera. The differential analysis of Bifidobacterium stratified by opioids, T2D and metformin, showed significant interactions among these factors indicating that the effect of one factor was changed by the other (FDR-adjusted p [q] < 0.01). In addition, the pair-wise comparison showed that participants with T2D not taking metformin had a significant 6.74 log2 fold increase in Bifidobacterium in opioid users as compared to non-users (q = 2.2 x 10-8). Since metformin was not included in this pair-wise comparison, the significant 'q' suggested association of opioid use with Bifidobacterium abundance. The differences in Bifidobacterium abundance could possibly be explained by opioids acting as organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1) inhibitors. Analysis stratified by lower and higher leptin and oxytocin (divided by the 50th percentile) in the subgroup without T2D showed lower Dialister in High-Leptin vs. Low-Leptin (p = 0.03). Contrary, the opposite was shown for oxytocin, higher Dialister in High-Oxytocin vs. Low-Oxytocin (p = 0.04).

   CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrated for the first time that Bifidobacterium and Prevotella abundance was affected by interactions of T2D, metformin and opioid use. Also, in subjects without T2D Dialister abundance varied according to circulating leptin and oxytocin.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a progressive disease that often requires a patient to use multiple antihyperglycemic agents to achieve glycemic control with disease progression. Omarigliptin is a once-weekly dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor. The purpose of this trial was to assess the efficacy and safety of adding omarigliptin to the treatment regimen of patients with T2D inadequately controlled by dual therapy with metformin and glimepiride.

   METHODS: Patients with T2D and HbA1c >=7.5% and <=10.5% while on metformin (>=1500 mg/day) and glimepiride (>=4 mg/day) were randomized to omarigliptin 25 mg once-weekly (N = 154) or placebo (N = 153) for 24 weeks. The primary objective was to assess whether omarigliptin was superior to placebo in reducing HbA1c at Week 24. Secondary objectives were to assess the effects of omarigliptin vs. placebo on FPG and the proportion of subjects attaining HbA1c goals of <7% and <6.5%.

   RESULTS: From a mean baseline HbA1c of 8.5% (omarigliptin) and 8.6% (placebo), the least squares (LS) mean change from baseline in HbA1c at Week 24 was -0.67% in the omarigliptin group and -0.06% in the placebo group, with a between-group difference (95% CI) of -0.61% (-0.85, -0.38). Treatment with omarigliptin resulted in a significantly greater reduction in FPG relative to placebo (LS mean difference [95% CI] -0.9 mmol/L [-1.4, -0.4]; p < 0.001). The proportion of patients achieving glycemic goals of <7.0% and <6.5% was higher in the omarigliptin group relative to the placebo group. The overall incidences of adverse events (AEs), serious AEs, drug-related AEs and discontinuations were generally similar between treatment groups. The incidence of symptomatic hypoglycemia was 10.5% in the omarigliptin group and 8.5% in the placebo group. Relative to baseline, omarigliptin and placebo treatments were associated with LS mean changes in body weight of -0.1 kg and -0.9 kg, respectively.

   CONCLUSION: In patients with T2D and inadequate glycemic control on dual therapy with metformin and glimepiride, compared with placebo, once-weekly omarigliptin provided greater improvement in glycemic control and was generally well tolerated.

Abstract
  The Korean Diabetes Association (KDA) recently updated the Clinical Practice Guidelines on antihyperglycemic agent therapy for adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In combination therapy of oral hypoglycemic agents (OHAs), general recommendations were not changed from those of the 2015 KDA guidelines. The Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines of the KDA has extensively reviewed and discussed the results of meta-analyses and systematic reviews of effectiveness and safety of OHAs and many clinical trials on Korean patients with T2DM for the update of guidelines. All OHAs were effective when added to metformin or metformin and sulfonylurea, although the effects of each agent on body weight and hypoglycemia were different. Therefore, selection of a second agent as a metformin add-on therapy or third agent as a metformin and sulfonylurea add-on therapy should be based on the patient's clinical characteristics and the efficacy, side effects, mechanism of action, risk of hypoglycemia, effect on body weight, patient preference, and combined comorbidity. In this review, we address the results of meta-analyses and systematic reviews, comparing the effectiveness and safety among OHAs. It will help to choose the appropriate drug for an individual patient with T2DM.

Abstract
  PURPOSE: Impaired beta-cell function remains unaddressed in PCOS. The aim of the study was to evaluate whether dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor alogliptin (ALO) alone or in combination with pioglitazone (PIO) improves beta-cell function along with insulin resistance (IR) in metformin (MET) treated obese women with PCOS with persistent IR.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 12-week randomized study, ALO 25 mg QD (n=15) or ALO 25 mg QD and PIO 30 mg QD (n=15) was added to MET 1000 mg BID in PCOS women (aged 34.4 +/- 6.5 years, BMI 39.0 +/- 4.9 kg/m2, HOMA-IR 4.82 +/- 2.52, mean +/- SD). Model derived parameters of glucose homeostasis from the meal tolerance test (MTT) were determined. The ability of the beta-cell function was assessed by the adaptation index (AI).

   RESULTS: MET-ALO and MET-ALO-PIO resulted in a significant decrease of HOMA-IR (by 1.6+/-2.3 (p=0.039) and 2.9+/-3.3 (p=0.001), respectively) and an increase in insulin sensitivity (IS) after meal ingestion (oral glucose IS) by 31.4+/-97.5 ml.min-1.m-2 (p=0.007) vs 39.0+/-58.1 ml.min-1.m-2 (p=0.039), respectively. AI across the entire group was significantly improved from 329.6+/-200.6 to 442.5+/-303.9 (p=0.048).

   CONCLUSIONS: ALO alone and in combination with PIO improved IR along with dynamic IS and meal related beta-cell function when added to MET treated PCOS.

Abstract
  Since 2013 several placebo-controlled cardiovascular outcomes trails on new classes of glucose-lowering agents in addition to standard care have been reported. These trails were designed to demonstrate non-inferiority to placebo with regard to cardiovascular safety for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus at high cardiovascular risk.For the glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1)-receptor agonists liraglutide and semaglutide as well as for the sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors empagliflozin and canagliflozin statistically significant reductions of the primary composite outcome (nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or cardiovascular death) were demonstrated. Cardiovascular outcomes trails for the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors saxagliptin, alogliptin, and sitagliptin did not show statistically significant differences for major cardiovascular events between treatment and placebo groups. Therefore, for patients with established cardiovascular disease who do not achieve sufficient blood glucose control on metformin monotherapy GLP-1-receptor agonists and SGLT-2 inhibitors should be favoured for diabetes therapy intensification. However, the use of DPP-4 inhibitors should be considered for patients who are in need of a well-tolerated and safe oral glucose-lowering therapy. Copyright © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart .

Other Abstract
  Publisher KARDIOVASKULaRE ENDPUNKTSTUDIEN: Seit 2013 wurden mehrere auf Nicht-Unterlegenheit angelegte, Placebo-kontrollierte Endpunktstudien zur kardiovaskularen Sicherheit einzelner Substanzen neuer antidiabetischer Wirkstoffklassen publiziert. Wahrend fur die Therapie mit den GLP-1-Rezeptoragonisten Liraglutid und Semaglutid sowie fur die mit den SGLT-2-Inhibitoren Empagliflozin und Canagliflozin eine Reduktion kardiovaskularer Endpunkte demonstriert werden konnte, zeigten die bisher abgeschlossenen Studien mit DPP-4-Inhibitoren keine Reduktion kardiovaskularer Ereignisse.THERAPIEESKALATION NACH METFORMIN: Fur die notwendige Therapieeskalation bei unzureichender Blutzuckerkontrolle unter Metformin wird bei Patienten mit Diabetes mellitus Typ 2 und hohem Risiko fur kardiovaskulare Erkrankungen vorrangig die Erweiterung der Therapie mit GLP-1-Rezeptoragonisten und SGLT-2-Inhibitoren empfohlen. Auch der Einsatz von DPP-4-Inhibitoren ist fur Patienten sinnvoll, bei denen einfache Therapiedurchfuhrung, gute Vertraglichkeit und Therapiesicherheit im Vordergrund stehen. Language: German

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: In patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes on basal insulin, prandial insulin may be initiated. We assessed the efficacy and safety of initiating insulin degludec/liraglutide fixed-ratio combination (IDegLira) versus basal-bolus insulin.

   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A phase 3b trial examined patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes on insulin glargine (IGlar U100) 20-50 units/day and metformin, randomized to IDegLira or IGlar U100 and insulin aspart <=4 times per day.

   RESULTS: Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) decreased from 8.2% (66 mmol/mol) to 6.7% (50 mmol/mol) with IDegLira and from 8.2% (67 mmol/mol) to 6.7% (50 mmol/mol) with basal-bolus (estimated treatment difference [ETD] -0.02% [95% CI -0.16, 0.12]; -0.2 mmol/mol [95% CI -1.7, 1.3]), confirming IDegLira noninferiority versus basal-bolus (P < 0.0001). The number of severe or blood glucose-confirmed symptomatic hypoglycemia events was lower with IDegLira versus basal-bolus (risk ratio 0.39 [95% CI 0.29, 0.51]; rate ratio 0.11 [95% CI 0.08, 0.17]). Body weight decreased with IDegLira and increased with basal-bolus (ETD -3.6 kg [95% CI -4.2, -2.9]). Fasting plasma glucose reductions were similar; lunch, dinner, and bedtime self-monitored plasma glucose measurements were significantly lower with basal-bolus. Sixty-six percent of patients on IDegLira vs. 67.0% on basal-bolus achieved HbA1c <7.0% (53 mmol/mol). Total daily insulin dose was lower with IDegLira (40 units) than basal-bolus (84 units total; 52 units basal).

   CONCLUSIONS: In patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes on IGlar U100 and metformin, IDegLira treatment elicited HbA1c reductions comparable to basal-bolus, with statistically superior lower hypoglycemia rates and weight loss versus weight gain.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: In randomized clinical trials, dapagliflozin has been shown to improve glycemic control, weight, and blood pressure. However, there is little real-world evidence of the effectiveness of dapagliflozin. The objective of this study is to investigate the real-world treatment outcomes of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) who initiated dapagliflozin in a referral-based endocrinology practice.

   METHODS: This study was a retrospective cohort analysis of patients with T2D who initiated dapagliflozin in 2015, using data from a large, specialist diabetes registry in Canada.

   RESULTS: 1520 patients were eligible for analysis. Following 3 to 6 months of treatment, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) decreased by a mean of 0.9% +/- 1.3% (9.8 +/- 14.2 mmol/mol) (P < 0.01), weight decreased 2.2 +/- 3.1 kg (P < 0.01), and systolic blood pressure decreased 3.7 +/- 14.3 mmHg (P < 0.01). The proportion of patients who achieved glycemic control (HbA1c <=7.0%) increased from 7.0% at baseline to 27.0% during follow-up. There was also a statistically significant decrease from baseline in body mass index, diastolic blood pressure, fasting glucose, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, alanine aminotransferase, and the proportion of patients with microalbuminuria (P < 0.01). A higher baseline HbA1c, shorter duration of diabetes, male gender, and greater weight loss were each independently associated with a greater reduction in HbA1c (P < 0.01).

   CONCLUSIONS: In a real-world clinical setting in Canada, dapagliflozin produced significant improvements in HbA1c, weight, and blood pressure in patients with T2D, comparable to that seen in randomized clinical trials.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Whether antidiabetic glitazone drugs protect against Parkinson's disease remains controversial. Although a single clinical trial showed no evidence of disease modulation, retrospective studies suggest that a disease-preventing effect may be plausible. The objective of this study was to examine if the use of glitazone drugs is associated with a lower incidence of PD among diabetic patients.

   METHODS: We compared the incidence of PD between individuals with diabetes who used glitazones, with or without metformin, and individuals using only metformin in the Norwegian Prescription Database. This database contains all prescription drugs dispensed for the entire Norwegian population. We identified 94,349 metformin users and 8396 glitazone users during a 10-year period and compared the incidence of PD in the 2 groups using Cox regression survival analysis, with glitazone exposure as a time-dependent covariate.

   RESULTS: Glitazone use was associated with a significantly lower incidence of PD compared with metformin-only use (hazard ratio, 0.72; 95% confidence interval, 0.55-0.94; P = 0.01).

   CONCLUSIONS: The use of glitazones is associated with a decreased risk of incident PD in populations with diabetes. Further studies are warranted to confirm and understand the role of glitazones in neurodegeneration. © 2017 The Authors.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: The rapid emergence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in the pediatric population has left pediatric endocrinologists with limited artillery in terms of management. While multiple medications are available for adults, Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved medications in children are limited to only metformin and insulin. Additional treatment options require randomized controlled trials, yet heretofore several barriers at the participant and institutional level have impeded these studies from proceeding in children and adolescents. Identification of the most challenging obstacles that pediatric endocrinologists experience in participating in industry-sponsored T2D trials may facilitate development of feasible platforms for future studies.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted an anonymous online survey consisting of 31 questions that assessed potential barriers to industry-sponsored clinical trials in pediatric patients with T2D. The survey was sent to members of the Pediatric Endocrine Society (PES), and members conducted the survey between October and November of 2014. As part of the survey, respondents rated the significance of several possible barriers to participation in industry-sponsored T2D studies.

   RESULTS: We received a total of 207 responses from members of PES. Baseline demographics showed that 50% of represented institutions care for 50 or fewer T2D patients age 18 years and younger; 70% of institutions diagnose 20 or fewer new T2D cases per year; and 3 racial groups predominated: African American, Hispanic, and Caucasian. A total of 70% of responders have a research infrastructure to participate in clinical trials, but only half have dedicated research nurses. Protocol restrictions on participant recruitment due to current glycemic control or medication use as well as frequent visit schedules were reported to be major obstacles. In addition, the financial support provided to centers to carry out the studies is insufficient.

   CONCLUSIONS: Efforts must be made to ease the burden of research participation on both pediatric T2D patients as well as pediatric endocrinologists. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Abstract
  In addition to weight loss, randomized controlled trials have shown improvement in glycaemic control in patients taking lorcaserin. The aim of this study aim was to compare adding lorcaserin or other glucose lowering medications to metformin on weight and glycaemic control. A systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials were conducted. Included studies (published 1990-2014) were of lorcaserin or glucose lowering medications in type 2 diabetic patients compared to placebo or different active treatments. Studies had to report >=1 key outcome (change in weight or HbA1c, % HbA1c <7, hypoglycaemia). Direct meta-analysis was performed using DerSimonian and Laird random effects models, and network meta-analysis with Bayesian Markov-chain Monte Carlo random effects models; 6552 articles were screened and 41 included. Lorcaserin reduced weight significantly more than thiazolidinediones, glinides, sulphonylureas and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, some of which may have led to weight gain. There were no significant differences in weight change between lorcaserin and alpha-glucoside inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists and sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors. Network meta-analysis showed lorcaserin was non-inferior to all other agents on HbA1c reduction and % achieving HbA1c of <7%. The risk of hypoglycaemia was not significantly different among studied agents except that sulphonylureas were associated with higher risk of hypoglycaemia than lorcaserin. Although additional studies are needed, this analysis suggests in a population of patients with a body mas index of >=27 who do not achieve glycaemic control on a single agent, lorcaserin may be added as an alternative to an add-on glucose lowering medication.

Abstract
  AIMS: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of fasiglifam, an orally active G-protein-coupled receptor 40 agonist, in combination with the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor sitagliptin, in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with diet/exercise (+/- metformin).

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, phase II study, 368 patients received once-daily placebo, sitagliptin 100 mg, fasiglifam 25 or 50 mg, or the combination of sitagliptin 100 mg plus fasiglifam 25 or 50 mg. The primary endpoint was change from baseline glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) at 12 weeks; a key secondary endpoint was change in fasting plasma glucose (FPG).

   RESULTS: The fasiglifam 25 and 50 mg combination regimens produced significantly greater HbA1c reductions than sitagliptin (treatment differences of -0.45% and -0.61%; P < .01, respectively) or respective doses of fasiglifam monotherapy (-0.43% and -0.48%; P < .01) and significantly greater FPG reductions than sitagliptin (-1.1 mmol/L for both combination regimens; P < .01). Improved glycaemic control occurred by week 1 for FPG and week 4 for HbA1c in all groups. Hypoglycaemia rates were low (<=3.3%) and similar across treatments. Liver enzymes >3 x upper limit of normal occurred in four patients (fasiglifam 25 mg, n = 1; fasiglifam 50 mg, n = 2; 1 fasiglifam/sitagliptin 50/100 mg, n = 1).

   CONCLUSIONS: Combination of fasiglifam and sitagliptin provided significant additional effects on glycaemic control, with hypoglycaemia rates similar to placebo with or without metformin. This study provides supportive clinical evidence for the complementary mechanism of actions of this GPR40 agonist and DPP-4 inhibitor. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Abstract
  AIMS: To assess the effect of LY2409021 on systolic blood pressure (SBP) in patients with type 2 diabetes.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: This 6-week, randomized, crossover study evaluated the effects of once-daily administration of LY2409021 20 mg vs those of placebo on SBP, diastolic BP (DBP), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) using 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) in 270 subjects treated with diet/exercise +/- metformin. Other measures included changes in glycemic control, serum lipids, and hepatic safety markers.

   RESULTS: At 6 weeks of LY2409021 treatment, 24-hour mean SBP was increased, with a least squares mean (LSM) difference of 2.26 mm Hg vs placebo (95% CI: 1.11, 3.40; P < .001). The 24-hour mean DBP and MAP also increased, with LSM differences of 1.37 mm Hg (95% CI: 0.66, 2.08; P < .001) and 1.67 mm Hg (95% CI: 0.86, 2.47; P < .001) vs placebo, respectively. At week 6, LY2409021 treatment reduced glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, with an LSM difference of -0.49% (-5.4 mmol/mol) (95% CI: -0.56%, -0.42% [-6.1, -4.6 mmol/mol]; P < .001) vs placebo. Mean HbA1c at baseline was 7.3% (56 mmol/mol). Small but significant changes in serum lipid and aminotransferase levels were observed with LY2409021 treatment (all P < .05 vs placebo).

   CONCLUSIONS: Statistically significant increases in BP, MAP and serum lipid levels were observed with LY2409021 treatment at a dose that lowered HbA1c and glucose levels. These effects may limit the clinical utility of LY2409021 as a chronic treatment for type 2 diabetes. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To observe the difference for type 2 diabetes between acupoint injection of human placenta tissue fluid combined with oral administration of metformin and simple metformin.

   METHODS: Sixty patients with type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned into a medication group and an injection group,30 cases in each one. In the oral medication group,metformin hydrochloride enteric-coated tablets was applied orally for continuous eight weeks,0.25 g a time,twice a day. In the injection group,based on the same oral administration,human placenta tissue fluid was injected into Diji(SP 8) and Yishu(EX-B 5) for two courses(four weeks as one course),once every other day and three times a week. Fast blood glucose(FBG),postprandial blood glucose(PBG),glycosylated hemoglobin(HbAlc) and clinical effect were observed in the two groups before and after treatment.

   RESULTS: Compared with those before treatment,FBG,PBG and HbAlc were decreased in the two groups after treatment (all P<0.05),with more apparent change in the injection group(all P<0.05). The total effective rate of the injection group was 90.0%(27/30),which was obviously better than 63.3%(19/30) of the medication group (P<0.05).

   CONCLUSIONS: Acupoint injection of human placenta tissue fluid combined with metformin hydrochloride enteric-coated tablets for type 2 diabetes can better lower blood glucose than simple metformin hydrochloride enteric-coated tablets.

Abstract
  AIMS: When patients with type 2 diabetes initiate insulin, metformin should be continued while continuation of other antihyperglycemics has unclear benefit. We aimed to identify practice patterns in antihyperglycemic therapy during the insulin transition, and determine factors associated with metformin continuation.

   METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of the Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) trial which randomized overweight/obese adults under ambulatory care for type 2 diabetes to an intensive lifestyle intervention or diabetes support and education. Among the 931 participants who initiated insulin over ten years, we described longitudinal changes in antihyperglycemic medications during the insulin transition, and performed multivariable logistic regression to estimate the association between patient characteristics and metformin continuation.

   RESULTS: Before insulin initiation, 81.0% of patients used multiple antihyperglycemics, the most common being metformin, sulfonylureas, and thiazolidinediones. After insulin initiation, metformin was continued in 80.3% of patients; other antihyperglycemics were continued less often, yet 58.0% of patients were treated with multiple non-insulin antihyperglycemics. Metformin continuation was inversely associated with age (fully adjusted (a) OR 0.60 per 10years [0.42-0.86]), serum creatinine above safety thresholds (aOR 0.09 [0.02-0.36]), lower income (P=0.025 for trend), taking more medications (aOR 0.92 per medication [0.86-0.98]), and initiating rapid, short, or premixed insulin (aOR 0.59 [0.39-0.89]).

   CONCLUSIONS: The vast majority of patients with type 2 diabetes continue metformin after insulin initiation, consistent with guidelines. Other antihyperglycemics are frequently continued along with insulin, and further research is needed to determine which, if any, patients may benefit from this. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract
  Liraglutide, a glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) receptor agonist, has showed favorable effects in the glycaemic control and weight reduction in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The meta-analysis was to compare the efficacy and safety of liraglutide added to metformin with other treatments in patients with T2DM. A systematic literature search on PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and the Cochrane library databases were performed. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of patients with T2DM who received the combination treatment of liraglutide and metformin. Pooled estimates were performed using a fixed-effects model or random-effects model. A total of nine RCTs met the inclusion criteria. Compared with control (placebo, sitagliptin, glimepiride, dulaglutide, insulin glargine, and NPH), liraglutide in combination with metformin resulted in significant reductions in HbA1c, bodyweight, FPG, and PPG, and similar reductions in SBP, and DBP. Moreover, liraglutide combined with metformin did not increase the risk of hypoglycemia, but induced a higher incidence of gastrointestinal disorders. In conclusion, this meta-analysis confirmed the use of liraglutide as add-on to metformin appeared to be effective and safe for patients with T2DM. However, considering the potential limitations in this study, more large-scale, well-conducted RCTs are needed to identify our findings.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors may have protective effects in the early stage of atherosclerosis in patients with type 2 diabetes, although similar effects in advanced atherosclerosis were not shown in recent randomized placebo-controlled studies. Therefore, we investigated the efficacy of DPP-4 inhibitor on endothelial function and glycemic metabolism compared with high-dose metformin.

   METHODS: In this multicenter, open-labeled, prospective, randomized, parallel-group comparison study, patients with type 2 diabetes treated with low-dose metformin (500-750 mg/day) were enrolled and randomly assigned to a vildagliptin, a DPP-4 inhibitor, add-on group (Vilda) or a double dose of metformin group (high Met) for 12 weeks. Flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and serum metabolic markers were assessed before and after treatment. In addition, glycemic control and metabolic parameters were also assessed.

   RESULTS: Ninety-seven subjects (aged 58.7 +/- 11.0 years; body mass index, 25.9 +/- 4.4 kg/m2; HbA1c, 7.3 +/- 0.5%; FMD, 5.8 +/- 2.6%) were enrolled. Eight subjects dropped out by the end of the study. There were no significant differences between the two groups in baseline characteristics. After 12 weeks, HbA1c was significantly improved in the Vilda group compared with the high Met group (- 0.80 +/- 0.38% vs. - 0.40 +/- 0.47%, respectively; p < 0.01). However, there were no significant differences in FMD (- 0.51 [- 1.08-0.06]% vs. - 0.58 [- 1.20-0.04]%). Although the apolipoprotein B/apolipoprotein A1 ratio was significantly reduced in the Vilda group compared with baseline (0.66-0.62; p < 0.01), the change did not differ significantly between the two groups (- 0.04 vs. 0.00; p = 0.27). Adiponectin levels were significantly increased in the Vilda group compared with the high Met group (0.75 mug/mL vs. 0.01 mug/mL; p < 0.01).

   CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of glycemic improvement, combination therapy of vildagliptin and metformin did not affect endothelial function but may exert favorable effects on adipokine levels and lipid profile in patients with type 2 diabetes without advanced atherosclerosis.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To investigate exenatide, a GLP-1 analogue, compared with acarbose, for intra-abdominal fat reduction in patients with obesity and type-2 diabetes.

   METHODS: This randomized controlled trial included 36 patients with obesity and type-2 diabetes, who were metformin-unresponsive, receiving metformin/exenatide (GLP-1 group) or metformin/acarbose (control group) for 3 months. Primary end-point: intra-abdominal fat content from baseline to 3 months; Secondary end-points: changes in fasting blood glucose, glycated haemoglobin (HbAlc), fasting insulin, blood lipids, weight, body mass index, and inflammatory cytokines from baseline to 3 months.

   RESULTS: Intra-abdominal fat content decreased in the GLP-1 group from baseline to 3 months (17,947+/-5804; 13,717+/-3628mm2, P=0.001, respectively), but was not significantly reduced in the control group (P=0.197) and at 3 months post-treatment, it was significantly lower in the GLP-1 group than control group (P=0.043). Glucose control, measured by HbA1c (GLP-1: 9.72+/-1.38; 7.09+/-0.60%, P<0.001, 9.46+/-1.25; 7.42+/-0.84%, P<0.001, respectively) and insulin resistance index LN(HOMA-IR) (GLP-1: 1.58+/-0.40; 1.01+/-0.33, P<0.001, Control: 1.53+/-0.57; 1.10+/-0.33, P=0.003, respectively) significantly improved in both groups with no significant difference between them. TNF-alpha, IL-6, and leptin were lower and adiponectin levels higher in the GLP-1 group at 3 months compared with baseline (all P<0.05), but not significantly changed in the control group. TNF-alpha, IL-6 and leptin levels were similar between groups. Adiponectin level was higher in the GLP-1 group than the control group at 3 months (P=0.025).

   CONCLUSION: Combined exenatide/metformin reduced intra-abdominal fat content, and enhanced insulin resistance and inflammatory status in patients with obesity and type-2 diabetes, representing a novel treatment regimen.

Abstract
  AIMS: This study aims to evaluate whether there is a difference between the effects of vildagliptin and gliclazide MR (modified release) on glycemic variability (GV) in women with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) as evaluated by continuous glucose monitoring (CGM).

   METHODS: An open-label, randomized study was conducted in T2DM women on steady-dose metformin monotherapy which were treated with 50mg vildagliptin twice daily or 60-120mg of gliclazide MR once daily. CGM and GV indices calculation were performed at baseline and after 24weeks.

   RESULTS: In total, 42 patients (age: 61.9+/-5.9years, baseline glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c): 7.3+/-0.56) were selected and 37 completed the 24-week protocol. Vildagliptin and gliclazide MR reduced GV, as measured by the mean amplitude of glycemic excursions (MAGE, p=0.007 and 0.034, respectively). The difference between the groups did not reach statistical significance. Vildagliptin also significantly decreased the standard deviation of the mean glucose (SD) and the mean of the daily differences (MODD) (p=0.007 and 0.030).

   CONCLUSIONS: Vildagliptin and gliclazide MR similarly reduced the MAGE in women with T2DM after 24weeks of treatment. Further studies are required to attest differences between vildagliptin and gliclazide MR regarding glycemic variability. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  Two years ago, data presented at the annual American Diabetes Association (ADA) meeting in New Orleans showed a marked decrease in deaths, especially those due to cardiovascular disease, with the use of empagliflozin. Two major questions have been asked: (i) was the result a fluke; and (ii) was it a class effect, or was it specific to the agent used? The hope that both questions would be answered by a second study has been answered: the conclusions of EMPA-REG were not an anomaly and it is a class effect, not one caused by a specific drug. Importantly, do these studies require us to alter our algorithms for the treatment of type 2 diabetes? The CANagliflozin cardioVascular Assessment Study (CANVAS) was designed similarly to EMPA-REG, enrolling individuals who either had known cardiac disease or were at high risk for cardiac disease. In fact, CANVAS involved two stages, CANVAS and CANVAS R, which can be analyzed together. There were 10 142 patients in the combined trial followed for a mean of 3.6 years. The average age was 63.3 years, 35.8% were women, the mean duration of diabetes was 13.5 years, and 65.6% had known cardiovascular disease. In EMPA-REG, 7020 patients were followed for 3.1 years, 28.5% were women, and all had established cardiovascular disease. The primary endpoint of both studies was the composite of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke. In both studies, the components of the composite endpoint were studied along with other endpoints, including hospitalization for heart failure, all-cause mortality, and progression of renal disease. The primary endpoint was identically positive for superiority with hazard ratio of 0.86 for empagliflozin versus placebo and for canagliflozin versus placebo. Some differences were observed: both death from cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality occurred significantly less frequently with empagliflozin in EMPA-REG, but the 13% lower total and cardiovascular mortality seen with canagliflozin in CANVAS was not statistically significant. Both studies showed a lower likelihood of hospitalization for heart failure with the intervention, even in patients without known heart failure at baseline, suggesting either that that diagnosis is often missed or that de novo heart failure may be prevented by these agents. Perhaps the strongest answer to the initial two questions comes from the CVD-REAL Study. Rather than being a randomized controlled clinical trial, that study analyzed medical claims, primary care or hospital records, and national registries from the US, Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Germany, and the UK, including 309 056 patients started on a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor or on other glucose-lowering drugs using a propensity score matching algorithm. Canagliflozin was used by 53% of those receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, dapagliflozin was used by 42% and empagliflozin was used by 5%; those using these agents had hazard ratios for hospitalization for heart failure and for mortality of 0.61 and 0.49, respectively, with no differences either by country or by drug. The interesting hypothesis that this and the two controlled trials show the harm of alternative treatments of diabetes rather than the benefit of SGLT2 inhibitors has not been confirmed by subset analyses of drug use in the control groups. There are several potentially important differences between the studies. Strokes increased with empagliflozin in EMPA-REG (not statistically significant). There was a significantly increased likelihood of lower extremity amputation in CANVAS, although these events may not have been fully studied in EMPA-REG. Finally, the benefit of SGLT2 inhibitor therapy were seen within 3 months in EMPA-REG, while not appearing as rapidly in CANVAS. Furthermore, in neither study was there a reduction in non-fatal myocardial infarction. These considerations suggest that the benefit of SGLT2 inhibitors is not due to improvement in the underlying atherosclerotic process. It is likely that all SGLT2 inhibitors will receive an indication for secondary prevention of heart failure; whether the agents should be used in primary prevention is a much more difficult question, because it would require a very large study of patients without heart disease. The introduction of HbA1c measurements in the late 1970s radically and significantly improved our treatment of diabetes. However, our treatment of diabetes is ultimately not to lower HbA1c, but to prevent the complications of diabetes. Values of HbA1c are only a surrogate measure of diabetes. Currently, there is little agreement on the treatment algorithm for diabetes after metformin therapy. One may now argue that an SGLT2 inhibitor should be the preferred second-line therapy.

Abstract
  AIMS: To analyse the effects of patient characteristics and different oral antidiabetes drug (OAD) use on standardised clinical outcomes in type 2 diabetes patients initiating insulin glargine 100 U/mL (Gla-100).

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patient-level data from 16 randomized, treat-to-target clinical trials that added Gla-100 to existing metformin (MET), sulfonylurea (SU) or metformin plus sulfonylurea (MET+SU) treatment in insulin-naive patients inadequately controlled by oral therapy were analysed and patients were followed for >=24 weeks. Change in glycated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) from baseline to week 24, other glycaemic endpoints and incidence of hypoglycaemia (overall, nocturnal, and severe) were analysed by age (<65 vs >=65 years), gender (male vs female), body mass index (BMI; <25 vs >=25 to <30 vs >30 kg/m2 ) and concomitant OAD (MET vs SU vs MET+SU).

   RESULTS: At baseline, the overall population (N = 3188) had a mean age of 57.7 years, BMI of 30.5 kg/m2 , HbA1c of 8.7%, fasting plasma glucose of 192 mg/dL, and 52.7% were male. Younger and older patients had similar HbA1c reductions with Gla-100 and a similar risk of hypoglycaemia. Females and patients with BMI <25 kg/m2 were less likely to achieve HbA1c targets and more likely to experience hypoglycaemia, regardless of concomitant OAD. Adding Gla-100 to SU therapy (alone or in combination with MET) increased hypoglycaemia risk across all analyses.

   CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that female patients with type 2 diabetes and normal-weight patients treated with Gla-100 and MET +/- SU are less likely to achieve glycaemic targets and, therefore, may require more clinical attention. Addition of Gla-100 to SU regimens may increase hypoglycaemia risk irrespective of age, gender, or BMI. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Abstract
  AIMS: To evaluate whether treatment with LY2409021, a novel, selective glucagon receptor antagonist, is associated with changes in hepatic fat and other safety variables related to the benefit-risk profile for chronic use in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D).

   METHODS: Safety and efficacy were assessed in patients with T2D taking metformin and sulphonylurea who were randomized to LY2409021 20 mg (n = 65), placebo (n = 68), or sitagliptin 100 mg (n = 41). Key endpoints included change from baseline to month 6 in hepatic fat fraction (HFF), assessed by magnetic resonance imaging; hepatic aminotransferases; blood pressure; lipid profile; fasting plasma glucose; and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c).

   RESULTS: A significant increase in HFF was seen with LY2409021 vs sitagliptin (least squares [LS] mean difference 3.72%; P < .001) and placebo (4.44%; P < .001), accompanied by significant elevations in alanine aminotransferase levels with LY2409021 vs sitagliptin (6.8 U/L; P = .039) and vs placebo (10.7 U/L; P < .001). No patients had concomitant elevations in bilirubin levels. LY2409021 treatment showed significant HbA1c reductions vs placebo (LS mean difference -0.77%; P < .001) but not sitagliptin (-0.20%; P = .383). Similar results were observed for fasting plasma glucose. LY2409021 was also associated with significant increases in systolic blood pressure vs sitagliptin (4.9 mm Hg; P = .030) and vs placebo (4.3 mm Hg; P = .029), as well as significant increases in body weight and total cholesterol. All effects of LY2409021 were reversible.

   CONCLUSION: In this cohort of patients with T2D, chronic glucagon receptor antagonism with LY2409021 was associated with glucose-lowering but also demonstrated increases in hepatic fat, hepatic aminotransferases, and other adverse effects. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Abstract
  AIM: To investigate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of saxagliptin compared with acarbose in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus inadequately controlled with metformin monotherapy.

   METHODS: SMART was a 24-week, multicentre, randomized, parallel-group, open-label Phase IV study conducted at 35 sites in China (September 24, 2014 to September 29, 2015). The primary outcome was absolute change from baseline in HbA1c at Week 24. Secondary outcomes assessed at Week 24 included the proportion of patients achieving HbA1c < 7.0%, the proportion of patients with gastrointestinal adverse events (GI AEs), and the proportion of patients achieving HbA1c < 7.0% without GI AEs. Safety and tolerability were also assessed in all patients who received >=1 dose of study medication.

   RESULTS: Four-hundred and eighty-eight patients were randomized (1:1) to saxagliptin or acarbose via a central randomization system (interactive voice/web response system); 241 and 244 patients received saxagliptin and acarbose, respectively, and 238 and 243 of these had >=1 pre- and >=1 post-baseline efficacy values recorded. Saxagliptin was non-inferior to acarbose for glycaemic control [Week 24 HbA1c change: -0.82% and -0.78%, respectively; difference (95% confidence interval): -0.04 (-0.22, 0.13)%], with similar proportions of patients in both treatment groups achieving HbA1c < 7.0%. However, fewer GI AEs were reported with saxagliptin compared with acarbose, and a greater number of patients who received saxagliptin achieved HbA1c < 7.0% without GI AEs compared with those receiving acarbose.

   CONCLUSION: Both therapies had similar efficacy profiles. However, saxagliptin was associated with fewer GI AEs, suggesting it might be preferential for clinical practice.

Abstract
  Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a frequent complication of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and elevates individuals' risk for cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in T2DM. Achieving and maintaining tight glycemic control is key to preventing development or progression of CKD; however, improving glycemic control may be limited by effects of renal impairment on the efficacy and safety of T2DM treatments, necessitating dosing adjustments and careful evaluation of contraindications. Understanding the treatment considerations specific to each class of T2DM medication is important in individualizing therapy and improving glycemic, renal, and cardiovascular outcomes. Traditional glucose-lowering treatments include insulin, metformin, sulfonylureas, meglitinides, and thiazolidinediones. Each of these agents exhibits altered pharmacokinetics in patients with renal impairment except for the thiazolidinediones, which are metabolized by the liver and do not accumulate appreciably in patients with renal impairment. Newer glucose-lowering treatments include GLP-1 receptor agonists, DPP-4 inhibitors, and SGLT2 inhibitors. Of these, only the DPP-4 inhibitor linagliptin can be used across all stages of renal impairment without dosing restrictions or concerns regarding dose escalation, and all SGLT2 inhibitors are contraindicated when eGFR <45 mL/min/1.73m2. Several of the newer treatments have also been investigated for effects on renal and cardiovascular outcomes, demonstrating potential benefits of the GLP-1 agonists liraglutide and semaglutide, as well as the SGLT2 inhibitors canagliflozin and empagliflozin, in reducing risk for some adverse renal and cardiovascular events. In addition, some DPP-4 inhibitors have been shown to reduce albuminuria, an indicator of glomerular dysfunction. Consideration of this information is useful in informing optimal management strategies for patients with T2DM and concomitant CKD. More clinical data from future and ongoing clinical trials, including data regarding potential renal and cardiovascular benefits, will be important in clarifying the safety and efficacy profiles of each of these agents in patients with CKD.

Abstract
  The 2013 American Heart Association Blood Cholesterol Guidelines increased the number of patients recommended for statin therapy in the United States to 56million. Two common statin side effects are muscle pain, referred to as "statin-associated muscle symptoms", and increased risk for new onset type-2-diabetes mellitus. Up to 25% of statin users report muscle symptoms resulting in many patients being switched to lower dose or lower potency statins, or refusing statins altogether. The most likely signaling mechanisms for statin-associated muscle symptoms overlaps with the proposed mechanism of statin-induced insulin resistance. Metformin has outstanding utility in reducing insulin resistance and preventing type-2-diabetes mellitus, but has not been studied for statin-associated muscle symptom rescue or prevention. The overlapping mechanisms of statin-associated muscle symptoms, statin-induced insulin resistance, and metformin intervention offers the potential to address two common and detrimental side effects of statins. As statins are the single best medication class for preventing cardiovascular events the potential for clinical benefit is large given metabolic syndrome's growing prevalence in the United States. Herein we hypothesize that metformin will rescue and prevent patients from statin-associated muscle symptoms. This hypothesis can benefit two patient groups: 1) patients at risk for diabetes who are taking a statin and experiencing muscle symptoms; and 2) patients with diabetes taking metformin who are to be started on a statin. Method to test Group 1) Symptom Rescue: randomized control trial of metformin versus placebo in patients with prediabetes who are already taking a statin, and are experiencing mild-to-moderate muscle symptoms. Method to test Group 2) Symptom Prevention: meta-analysis, of statin randomized control trials, with patient level data, comparing patients taking metformin at baseline to patients not taking metformin when a statin is started. An efficient method to simulate both symptom rescue and symptom prevention is a skeletal muscle cell culture model of statin-associated muscle symptom markers. These experiments would identify if metformin reverses (rescues) or prevents markers of statin-associated muscle symptoms. As metformin is recommended by the American Diabetes Association for type-2-diabetes mellitus prevention, yet not frequently used, validating this hypothesis will lead towards research and practice change including: a) decreases in the frequency of statin-associated muscle symptoms; leading to subsequent increases in statin therapy compliance; b) increases in metformin use in prediabetes with subsequent decrease in the incidence of type-2-diabetes mellitus; and c) decreases in complications of both cardiovascular disease and diabetes due to improved statin compliance and type-2-diabetes mellitus prevention.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus type 2 (T2DM) often co-exists with hypertension, and this aggregation of co-morbidities amplifies the risk for future cardiovascular events. Therefore, it appears crucial to understand the essence of choosing oral and non-insulin injectable anti-diabetic drugs (ADs) with a favorable hemodynamic impact that could partially attenuate the increased baseline cardiovascular risk.

   OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate the effect of ADs on blood pressure (BP) indices and to assess the potential role of certain ADs towards hypertension treatment.

   METHOD: We performed a systematic review of the literature searching MEDLINE via Pubmed for all human studies implementing ADs, either individually or in combinations.

   RESULTS: Metformin was found to reduce BP in small cohorts but failed to confirm its beneficial effect in a metaanalysis of 41 studies. Thiazolidinediones are associated with BP lowering but are contraindicated in patients with heart failure. Sulfonylureas, on the other hand, may increase BP, while a-glucosidase inhibitors, DPP-4 inhibitors, and SGLT2 inhibitors activate favorable pathophysiologic mechanisms serving as potential BP lowering agents. Relevant BP reduction was established for GLP-1 Ras in most clinical trials.

   CONCLUSION: The favorable hemodynamic impact of certain classes of ADs might provide synergistic or incremental therapeutic benefits in high-risk patients suffering from both T2DM and hypertension. Additional randomized trials designed under the hypothesis of the emerging beneficial hemodynamic effect of ADs are expected to provide more robust evidence and to guide the optimization of combined treatment strategies in this challenging group of patients.

Abstract
  AIM: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of the proposed organic cation transporter (OCT) inhibitor daclatasvir on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the OCT substrate metformin.

   METHODS: This was an open-label, two-period, randomized, crossover trial in 20 healthy subjects. Treatment A consisted of metformin and treatment B consisted of metformin + daclatasvir. Pharmacokinetic curves were recorded at steady-state. Geometric mean ratios (GMRs) with 90% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for metformin area under the concentration-time curve from 0 h to 12 h (AUC0-12 ), maximum plasma concentration (Cmax ) and final plasma concentration (Clast ). An oral glucose tolerance test was performed, measuring insulin, glucose and lactate levels.

   RESULTS: The GMRs (90% CI) of metformin AUC0-12 , Cmax and Clast (B vs. A) were 109% (102-116%), 108% (101-116%) and 112% (103-122%). The geometric mean AUC0-2 for insulin, glucose and lactate during treatments A and B were 84 h. mEl-1 and 90 h. mEl-1 , 13.6 h. mmol l-1 and 13.4 h. mmol l-1 , and 3.4 h. mmol l-1 and 3.5 h. mmol l-1 , respectively.

   CONCLUSIONS: Bioequivalence analysis showed that daclatasvir does not influence the pharmacokinetics of metformin in healthy subjects. Pharmacodynamic parameters were also comparable between treatments. Copyright © 2017 The British Pharmacological Society.

Abstract
  Subcutaneous insulin glargine/lixisenatide (Suliqua TM) is a titratable, fixed-ratio combination of a long-acting basal insulin analogue and a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist for the treatment of adult patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes. Once-daily insulin glargine/lixisenatide, in combination with metformin, provided effective glycaemic control and was generally well tolerated in the 30-week, multinational, phase 3 LixiLan-O and LixiLan-L trials in insulin-naive and -experienced adult patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes. Although long-term clinical experience with this fixed-ratio combination is currently lacking, given its convenient once-daily regimen and beneficial effects on glycaemic control and bodyweight loss in the absence of an increase in the incidence of hypoglycaemia, insulin glargine/lixisenatide is an emerging option for the treatment of adult patients with type 2 diabetes to improve glycaemic control when this has not been provided by metformin alone or metformin combined with another OAD or basal insulin.

Abstract
  Epidemiological evidence reveals that patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have an increased risk of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), including dementia and Parkinson's disease (PD). The effects of metformin exposure on dementia and PD risk in patients with T2DM are unknown. We evaluated the effects of metformin exposure on the risk of dementia and PD in patients with T2DM. We performed a cohort study by using Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. We recruited 4651 patients in the metformin cohort and a comparable number of nonmetformin controls by using propensity score matching. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate the effects of metformin on the risk of dementia and PD after adjustment for several confounding factors. During the 12-year follow-up, the metformin cohort exhibited a higher risk of PD than the nonmetformin cohort (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.27, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.68-3.07). The metformin cohort had an increased risk of all-cause dementia (HR: 1.66, 95% CI=1.35-2.04). Moreover, metformin exposure increased the risk of Alzheimer's disease (HR: 2.13, 95% CI=1.20-3.79) and vascular dementia (HR: 2.30, 95% CI=1.25-4.22). The effects of exposure duration and dosage on dementia and PD occurrence were also observed. Long-term metformin exposure in patients with T2DM may lead to the development of NDs, including dementia and PD. Additional large-scale, prospective controlled trials are required to confirm the observed association in patients with T2DM. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  A network meta-analysis was performed in order to compare the efficacy and safety of single- or double-drug antidiabetic regimens in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). PubMed and Cochrane Library searches were conducted since inception to February 2017. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of different antidiabetic regimens in the treatment of T2DM were included in this study. Direct and indirect evidences were combined to calculate the odds ratio (OR) or weighted mean difference (WMD) and its 95% confidence interval (95%CI), and in order to draw the surface under the cumulative ranking curves (SUCRA). A total of 19 RCTs meeting our inclusion criteria were finally incorporated into our network meta-analysis, including 19 single- or double-drug antidiabetic regimens. The network meta-analysis showed that the anti-hyperglycemic effects of Sitagliptin + Metformin, Empagliflozin + Metformin, Exenatide + Metformin, Vildagliptin + Metformin, Taspoglutide + Metformin, and Pioglitazone + Metformin were better than individual Metformin regimens. Dulaglutide + Metformin and Taspoglutide + Metformin regimens were comparatively less safe than individual Metformin regimens. The cluster ranking analysis based on SUCRA values suggested that Taspoglutide + Metformin regimens had best efficacy and worst safety among the different therapy regimens. Our data confirmed previous observations and suggested that Taspoglutide + Metformin regimen may have better efficacy for the treatment of T2DM among 19 therapy regimens, while its incidence of adverse events was relatively higher.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality are higher among patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 (T2DM), particularly those with concomitant CV diseases, compared with other populations. In patients with T2DM, intensive glucose lowering reduces microvascular disease, but has a smaller and debated effect on CV events or mortality. In this setting, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required in 2008 that all new agents for the treatment of T2DM should be evaluated in terms of CV safety. Metformin has long been established as first-line pharmacological therapy in patients with T2DM, due to its proven beneficial CV effects. Despite the controversies about the issue of the CV safety of other oral antidiabetic agents such as sulfonylureas (SUs) and thiazolidinediones (TZDs), long-term randomized trials suggested neutral effects of these agents on macrovascular disease. Moreover, there are a number of CV outcome trials designed to determine the long-term CV safety of new glucose-lowering agents, like dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, and sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. Although the results of these trials indicate the CV safety of oral new antidiabetic agents, only one of them (with empagliflozin) has so far reported reduction of CV events. Recently, LEADER (Liraglutide Effect And Action in Diabetes: Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcome Results - A Long-term Evaluation), a CV outcome trial in diabetic patients by using an injectable glucose-lowering agent (liraglutide) has also reported a reduction in CV outcomes.

   CONCLUSION: The present review considers the long-term CV effects of anti-diabetic drugs and updates the relevant randomized CV outcome studies of oral glucose-lowering agents. Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.

Abstract
  AIMS: To assess the efficacy and safety of once-weekly omarigliptin as monotherapy in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

   METHODS: People with T2DM not on glucose-lowering medications, or who were washed off monotherapy or low-dose dual therapy, were randomized double-blind to omarigliptin 25mg (n=165) or matching omarigliptin placebo (n=164) for 24weeks, followed by a 30-week period to assess continuing efficacy and safety longer-term of omarigliptin during which metformin was added to the placebo group and metformin placebo to the omarigliptin group.

   RESULTS: From a mean baseline HbA1c of 8.0-8.1%, the least squares mean (95% CI) change from baseline in HbA1c at week 24 (primary endpoint) was -0.49% (-0.73, -0.24) in the omarigliptin group and -0.10% (-0.34, 0.14) in the placebo group, for a between-group difference of -0.39% (-0.59, -0.19) (p<.001). Protocol deviation in use of metformin by 38 of 252 (15%) people whose samples were available for evaluation probably attenuated glycemic efficacy results, as suggested by the LS mean difference -0.53% (-0.75, -0.32) after censoring of such participants. At 24 and 54weeks, the incidences of adverse events (AEs) were similar in the omarigliptin and placebo groups. During 54weeks there were no AEs of symptomatic hypoglycemia in the omarigliptin group and 5 AEs in the placebo group. Over 54weeks, a majority of the omarigliptin treatment had a persistent reduction in HbA1c, remaining rescue-free.

   CONCLUSIONS: In people with T2DM, omarigliptin monotherapy improved glycemic control over 54weeks and was generally well tolerated with a low risk of hypoglycemia.

Abstract
  Randomized controlled trials (RCT) are often underpowered for validating gene-treatment interactions. Using published data from the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), we examined power in conventional and genotype-based recall (GBR) trials. We calculated sample size and statistical power for gene-metformin interactions (vs. placebo) using incidence rates, gene-drug interaction effect estimates and allele frequencies reported in the DPP for the rs8065082 SLC47A1 variant, a metformin transported encoding locus. We then calculated statistical power for interactions between genetic risk scores (GRS), metformin treatment and intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) given a range of sampling frames, clinical trial sample sizes, interaction effect estimates, and allele frequencies; outcomes were type 2 diabetes incidence (time-to-event) and change in small LDL particles (continuous outcome). Thereafter, we compared two recruitment frameworks: GBR (participants recruited from the extremes of a GRS distribution) and conventional sampling (participants recruited without explicit emphasis on genetic characteristics). We further examined the influence of outcome measurement error on statistical power. Under most simulated scenarios, GBR trials have substantially higher power to observe gene-drug and gene-lifestyle interactions than same-sized conventional RCTs. GBR trials are becoming popular for validation of gene-treatment interactions; our analyses illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of this design.

Abstract
  Inhibition of sodium glucose cotransporter 2 with empagliflozin results in caloric loss by increasing urinary glucose excretion and has a mild diuretic effect. Diuretic effects are usually associated with reflex-mediated increases in sympathetic tone, whereas caloric loss is associated with decreased sympathetic tone. In an open-label trial, muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) (burst frequency, burst incidence, and total MSNA) was assessed using microneurography performed off-treatment and on day 4 of treatment with empagliflozin 25 mg once daily in 22 metformin-treated patients with type II diabetes (mean [range] age 54 [40-65] years). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP), heart rate, urine volume, and body weight were assessed before and on day 4 (BP, heart rate), day 5 (urine volume), or day 6 (body weight) of treatment with empagliflozin. After 4 days of treatment with empagliflozin, no significant changes in MSNA were apparent despite a numerical increase in urine volume, numerical reductions in BP, and significant weight loss. There were no clinically relevant changes in heart rate. Empagliflozin is not associated with clinically relevant reflex-mediated sympathetic activation in contrast to increases observed with diuretics in other studies. Our study suggests a novel mechanism through which sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibition affects human autonomic cardiovascular regulation. Copyright © 2017 American Society of Hypertension.

Abstract
  AIM: A clinical appraisal of existing scientific literature sought to assess the need for long-term prospective epidemiological studies to investigate an increased cancer risk of anti-hyperglycemic medication in type 2 diabetes.

   METHOD: A focus statement was formulated as: "With a higher risk of cancers in patients with type 2 diabetes, all anti-hyperglycemic drugs should undergo long-term, prospective epidemiological studies for cancer risks." Field surveys were sent to practicing physicians and endocrinologists to identify the currently prevalent level of acceptance of this statement. Subsequently, a meeting with a six-member panel of key opinion leaders was held to discuss published evidence in support and against the statement. This publication reviews the publications and discussion points brought forth in this meeting and their effect on statement acceptance by the panel.

   RESULTS: Whereas the majority of field survey responders primarily agreed with the statement, panel members were divided in their statement support. This division remained intact after review of the literature.

   CONCLUSIONS: While there was evidence that type 2 diabetes is associated with an increased risk of cancer, existing studies seemed insufficient to definitively demonstrate a link between cancer risk and use of specific anti-hyperglycemic therapies.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: We aimed to investigate the efficacy of ascorbic acid and acetylsalicylic acid among type II diabetes mellitus patients using metformin (only) for diabetes management therapy.

   METHOD: A 12-month single blinded multicenter randomized control trial was designed to investigate the measured variables [Glycated Hemoglobin (HbA1c), Renal function, Albumin Creatinine Ratio (ACR) etc.]. The trial was randomized into 2 experimental parallel arms (ascorbic acid vs acetylsalicylic acid) were blinded with study supplements in combination with metformin and findings were compared to control arm with metformin alone and blinded with placebo. Withdrawal criteria was defined to maintain the equity and balance in the participants in the whole trial.

   FINDING: Patients with metformin and ascorbic acid (parallel arm I) was twice more likely to reduce HbA1c than metformin alone (control arm) in a year (OR 2.31 (95% CI 1.87-4.42) p < 0.001). Also Parallel arm I was ten times more likely to reduced risk factors contributing to long-term diabetes complications than participants of arm II in a year (OR 10.38 (95% CI 6.91-15.77) p < 0.001). In contrast, parallel arm II patients were seven times more effective to reduce the risk of expected CVD development in 10 years than arm I (OR 7.54 (95% CI 3.76-10.32) p < 0.001).

   CONCLUSIONS: The trial concluded that ascorbic acid with metformin is more effective against reducing risks for diabetes related long-term complications (including ACR).

Abstract
  PURPOSE: This 28-week, randomized, double-blind study compared a once-weekly injection of dulaglutide 1.5 mg to placebo, both added to titrated once-daily insulin glargine (with or without metformin), in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and inadequate glycemia control (control defined as hemoglobin A1c, >=7% and <=10.5%). Patient-reported outcomes were assessed as an exploratory objective to further understand patients' physical, psychological, and social aspects of well-being and injection-device experience.

   METHODS: Patients not naive to injectable therapy were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive dulaglutide/glargine or placebo/glargine; glargine was titrated to a fasting plasma glucose target of 71 to 99 mg/dL. The Impact of Weight on Self-Perceptions (IW-SP), the EQ-5D-5L (measure of health status), the 18-item Diabetes Health Profile (DHP-18), and the Medication Device Delivery Assessment (MDDAB) instruments for assessing the dulaglutide Single-Use Pen (SUP) and glargine-delivery device were administered at baseline and 28 weeks, and also at 6 or 12 weeks for some measures. A mixed model for repeated measures was used for analyzing changes from baseline scores.

   FINDINGS: At 28 weeks, improvements observed in the transformed total scores on the IW-SP and DHP-18 Disinhibited Eating domain were significantly greater with dulaglutide/glargine compared with placebo/glargine (least squares mean differences, +6.06 [P = 0.019] and -4.50 [P = 0.017], respectively). There were no significant overall between-treatment differences in quality of life as measured by the EQ-5D-5L or the Barriers to Activities and Psychological Distress domains of the DHP-18. Of all patients, 95% reported that overall, the dulaglutide SUP was "easy" or "very easy" to use at 28 weeks. Device-features scores showed that most patients liked the dulaglutide SUP features, with the 3 highest-rated items relating specifically to features of the needle (not having to touch the needle, not having to attach the needle, and automatic insertion). The majority of patients (~90%) "agreed" or "strongly agreed" that they were satisfied with the overall dulaglutide SUP injection experience at 28 weeks.

   IMPLICATIONS: Dulaglutide/glargine-treated patients had greater improvements in weight-related quality-of-life measures compared with placebo/glargine-treated patients, which may be clinically relevant when evaluating treatment options for insulin-requiring patients who often gain weight with insulin monotherapy. Results from the MDDAB indicated overall satisfaction with the dulaglutide SUP injection experience, which may be an important factor in some patients when initiating parenteral therapy.

Abstract
  PURPOSE: The aim of this analysis was to identify factors associated with the choice of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) therapy at the time of intensification of antidiabetic treatment across 4 European countries.

   METHODS: Antidiabetic drug prescription/dispensing records and patients' characteristics were obtained from the electronic health care records of patients with T2DM from the Netherlands (NL), Italy, and Spain (ES) (all, 2007-2011); and the United Kingdom (UK; 2008-2012). Oral monotherapy was defined as first-line; oral dual therapy, as second-line; >2 oral treatments or oral combined with an injectable, as third-line; and injectables only, as fourth-line treatment. Treatment intensification was defined as the start of a higher line of treatment. Comedication, comorbidities, clinical parameters, and other factors associated with treatment choice were identified using multivariate relative risk estimation by Poisson regression with robust error variance.

   FINDINGS: In the 5-year study period, 485,120 patients (79% of the treated T2DM population) underwent treatment intensification. Changes in treatment choice were clearly visible over the study period, such as a decline in the use of thiazolidinediones (NL, ES, UK) and increases in the use of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4i) (NL, ES, UK) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (UK). With first-line treatment, advanced age and renal comorbidity were associated with the use of sulfonylureas (SUs; all countries), whereas high body mass index (BMI) was inversely associated with SU use in the United Kingdom and Spain. With second-line treatment, advanced age was associated with metformin + SU use (all countries); and renal comorbidity with SU + DPP4i use in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. High BMI was associated with metformin + thiazolidinedione (TZD) use in the United Kingdom and Spain, and with metformin + DPP4i in the United Kingdom. With third-line treatment, advanced age and renal comorbidity were associated with the use of SU + insulin (NL, ES, UK). Hemoglobin A1c >8.5% was positively associated, and high BMI was inversely associated, with the use of any third-line combination containing insulin. Across treatment lines TZD and metformin were negatively associated with renal and cardiac morbidity. Second and third line treatment choices strongly depended on prior treatments. With fourth-line treatment, women were more likely to receive glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists than were men in the United Kingdom and Spain.

   IMPLICATIONS: The results suggest that the main factors driving treatment choice at any stage of intensification were age, hemoglobin A1c, BMI, renal and cardiac morbidity, and treatment history. These drivers were consistent with guidelines on, and contraindications of, specific medications. Differences between countries were generally consistent with, but not solely attributable to, differences in local guidelines and reimbursement policies. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier HS Journals, Inc.

Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: The GERODIAB study is a multicenter prospective observational study performed over 5 years in French patients aged 70 years or above with type 2 diabetes. This report deals with their cardiovascular complications and their relationship with survival.

   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Consecutive patients (n = 987, median age = 77 years) were included from 56 diabetes centers over 1 year. Individual characteristics, history and complications of diabetes, geriatric factors, and clinical and biological parameters were recorded. Survival was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and proportional hazards regression models.

   RESULTS: The frequency of cardiovascular complications increased from 47% at inclusion to 67% at 5 years. The most frequent complications were coronary heart disease (increasing from 30% to 41%) and vascular disease of the lower limbs (25% to 35%) and of the cerebral vessels (15% to 26%). Heart failure was less common, but its frequency doubled during the follow-up (9% to 20%). It was strongly associated with poor survival (P < 0.0001), as was vascular disease of the lower limbs (P = 0.0004), whereas coronary heart disease (P = 0.0056) and vascular disease of cerebral vessels (P = 0.026) had mild associations. Amputation (P < 0.0001) and foot wounds (P < 0.0001) were strongly associated with survival. In multivariate models, heart failure was the strongest predictor of poor survival (hazard ratio [HR] 1.96 [95% CI 1.45-2.64]; P < 0.0001). It remained significant when other factors were considered simultaneously (HR 1.92 [95% CI 1.43-2.58]; P < 0.0001).

   CONCLUSIONS: Cardiovascular complications are associated with poor survival in elderly patients with type 2 diabetes, especially heart failure. Copyright © 2017 by the American Diabetes Association.
